教育时评：如何防止被拐儿童的发生？	Education Times Commentary: How to Prevent the Abduction of Children?
如果把“收拐”比作“抢劫”，那么，只有当社会环境中没有“抢劫”需求时，社会共同努力，把“抢劫”行为变成没有利润可言、风险大、成本高的行为，这类犯罪才会不再发生。	If we compare "trafficking" to "robbery", then only when there is no demand for "robbery" in the social environment, can the society work together to make "robbery" an activity with no profit, high risk and high cost, and this kind of crime will no longer occur.

刑事惩罚的目的不仅仅是惩罚犯罪者，还包括社会报复、社会警示和社会教育。	The purpose of criminal punishment is not only to punish the offender, but also to serve as a social retribution, warning, and education.
但是，在拐卖案件被揭发之前，应该优先考虑被害人的精神健康。	But before trafficking cases are exposed, the mental health of the victims should be prioritized.

为了应对拐卖问题，许多国家都制定了严格的法律来惩罚拐卖犯罪者。	In order to combat trafficking, many countries have enacted strict laws to punish traffickers.

陆先生还提起诉讼，要求余姚市人民法院判令林某赔偿其经济损失。	Mr. Lu also filed a lawsuit to the Yuyao City People's Court, asking it to order Lin to compensate for his economic losses.
法院认为，双方未能签订正式合同，但被告仍应承担一定的违约责任，因此应当根据实际情况，合理确定被告的违约责任。	The court found that while the parties had failed to enter into a formal contract, the defendant should still bear some responsibility for the breach, and thus the defendant's liability for breach should be reasonably determined according to the actual circumstances.

德国总理肖尔茨表示，他将继续支持欧洲联盟，并将继续推动欧洲一体化进程。	German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that she will continue to support the European Union and will continue to push for European integration.

拜登总统还表示，“我们有责任支持和保护那些勇敢地抗争不公正的人，以及那些担负起改变的责任，并且把它们转化为实际行动的人。”	President Biden also stated, "We have a responsibility to support and protect those who bravely fight against injustice, and those who take on the responsibility of change and turn it into action."

教育思考：如何让学生在大学考试中发挥出最大的潜力-新华网	Educational Thinking: How to Maximize Student Potential in College Exams - Xinhua News
兰州交通大学3名学生还要求学校提供更多的实践性课程，以更好地发挥学生的创造力和实践能力。	The three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University also asked the school to provide more practical courses to better tap into students' creativity and practical skills.
但是，近年来，大学招生的竞争也变得越来越激烈，许多学生都在努力提高自己的考试成绩。	However, in recent years, competition for college admissions has become increasingly fierce, with many students striving to improve their test scores.
在大学校园，学生们有着不同的文化背景，他们的学习方式也各有不同，这使得学习水平也有所差异。	In college campuses, students come from different cultural backgrounds and have different learning styles, which leads to varying levels of learning.
对于这样一个多元文化的群体，每个人都有不同的观点，这是不可避免的。	For such a diverse cultural group, everyone has different perspectives, which is inevitable.
如果考试试题难度过高，学生们可能会感到沮丧，甚至失去信心。	If the exam questions are too difficult, students may feel frustrated and even lose confidence.
学习有效率的学生，可以利用短时间内的集中突击，达到更高的成绩，而不是只是及格。	Efficient students can use short bursts of intense study to achieve higher grades, rather than just passing.
同时，也出现了“学霸”平时学习努力，但考试成绩却不理想的“怪现象”。	At the same time, there is also the "strange phenomenon" of "academic elites" who work hard in their studies but do not perform well in exams.
因此，兰州交通大学的学生们呼吁教育部门采取措施，以确保大学考试的公平性和公正性。	Therefore, students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University are calling on the education department to take measures to ensure fairness and justice in university exams.
同样值得称赞的是，这3名学生还把他们的信件发给了当地的政府官员，以表达他们的担忧。	Equally commendable is that the three students also sent their letters to local government officials to express their concerns.
同样，在考试中，有些学生会试图通过抄袭、窃取他人答案或者把考试答案传播给其他学生来获得不正当的优势。	Similarly, during exams, some students may attempt to gain an unfair advantage by cheating, stealing answers from others, or spreading exam answers to other students.
在笔者看来，大学考试的有效性，更在于考试内容的科学性，以及考试的公平性，以确保考试的公正性。	In my opinion, the effectiveness of university exams lies in the scientific nature of the exam content and the fairness of the exam to ensure the fairness of the exam.
在大学本科阶段，学生们可以选择参加一些专业实践课程，以更好地掌握专业技能。	During the undergraduate stage of college, students can choose to take specialized practical courses to better master professional skills.
同时，大学考试也会考察学生对学科知识的理解能力，以及他们如何将知识运用到实际问题中的能力。	At the same time, university exams also test students' understanding of the subject matter and their ability to apply knowledge to real-world problems.
相比之下，研究生课程更加重视实践，学生们可以在实验室中进行实践，从而更好地理解和掌握学科知识。	In comparison, graduate courses emphasize more on practice, where students can do experiments in the laboratory to better understand and master the subject knowledge.
教师们表示，20年前学习的基础知识，如今仍然是学习大学数学的重要组成部分。	Teachers have noted that the foundational knowledge learned 20 years ago is still an important part of learning university mathematics today.
但是，考试的难度会随着时间的推移而变化，以更好地测试学生的知识水平。	However, the difficulty of the exam may change over time in order to better test the students' knowledge.
在大学考试中，考试结果的评定也是由学科资深教师和全体老师共同参与，以确保考试结果的公平性和准确性。	In university exams, the evaluation of the results is also done by senior subject teachers and all teachers together to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the results.
同时，考试命题还要注重考查学生的综合素质，比如分析能力、解决问题的能力、创新能力等。	At the same time, the test questions should also focus on testing the students' comprehensive qualities, such as analytical ability, problem-solving ability, and innovation ability.
同时，大学教育也应该更多地关注学生的实践能力，以及他们在实践中学习的能力，以提高学生的综合素质。	At the same time, university education should also pay more attention to students' practical abilities and their ability to learn in practice, in order to improve their overall quality.
兰州交大校方还将继续加强学生的参与意识，鼓励学生发表自己的观点，为校园文化的发展做出贡献。	Lanzhou Jiaotong University will also continue to strengthen students' sense of participation and encourage them to express their views and contribute to the development of campus culture.
要求各教学单位组织教师开展课堂教学质量评估，提高教学质量，提高学生学习效果，提高教学管理水平。	Require teaching units to organize teachers to carry out classroom teaching quality evaluation, improve teaching quality, improve students' learning effect, and improve teaching management level.
同时，大学考务也需要重视考试的组织和管理，以确保考试的公平性，让每一位考生都能够公平竞争，发挥自己的最大潜力。	At the same time, university examination affairs also need to pay attention to the organization and management of examinations to ensure the fairness of examinations, so that every examinee can compete fairly and give full play to their maximum potential.
如果您无法前往分店，您可以选择在线订购，我们将为您提供送货上门服务。	If you are unable to visit the store, you can opt for online ordering and we will provide you with delivery services at your doorstep.
那么我可以把这笔钱捐给慈善机构吗？	Can I donate this money to a charity then?
同事的订单已经发出，正在按时到达客户手中。	The orders of the colleague have been sent out and are arriving on time to the customers.
尝试重新启动计算机，看看是否可以解决问题。	Try restarting your computer to see if that solves the problem.
如果你想知道你的位置，你可以使用全球定位系统（GPS）来查看你的位置。	If you want to know where you are, you can use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to check your location.
金夫人婚纱摄影(南街店) 将在未来几个月内开设新的分店，以满足更多客户的需求。	Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) will be opening new branches in the coming months to meet the needs of more customers.
顾问兰兰还帮助我们提供了拍照的地点建议，让我们拍出了更加精彩的照片。	Lanlan, the consultant, also helped us with suggestions on the location for the photoshoot, which resulted in more stunning photos.
他们最终决定在一个晴朗的周六拍摄，以便更多的人可以参加。	They eventually decided to shoot on a sunny Saturday so that more people could attend.
金夫人的团队成员，从礼仪师到演讲教练，都能够提供最高水平的服务。	Mrs. Kim's team members, from etiquette coaches to speech coaches, are able to provide the highest level of service.
我第一次尝试化妆时，我的妈妈就在旁边，给我提供了很多宝贵的建议。	When I first tried makeup, my mom was right there giving me lots of valuable advice.
晓洁和另一位妹子（抱歉我忘记了她的名字）的服务态度非常好，技术也很熟练。	Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I forgot her name) were very friendly and had great technical skills.
化妆师还会给拍摄的模特儿提供一些小技巧，比如如何摆姿势，如何改变表情，以及如何更好地展示出自己的特色。	The makeup artist also provided some tips to the models being photographed, such as how to pose, how to change expressions, and how to better show off their features.
摄影师也会给拍摄的模特提供建议，以帮助他们更好地展现出自己的特色。	The photographer also provides advice to the models they are shooting to help them better showcase their features.
我们在选择照片的时候，也没有让客人减少照片的意思，只是按照套餐里的24张照片，挑选出最好的照片，以便客人能够拥有最好的照片。	When we were selecting the photos, we didn't mean to have the customers reduce the number of photos either, but just to pick out the best photos from the 24 photos in the package, so that the customers could have the best photos.
兰兰还提供了一些有用的建议，帮助我更好地拍摄照片，以便在下次拍摄时不会出现同样的问题。	Lan Lan also provided some useful tips to help me take better photos so that the same issue won't happen again the next time I take photos.
把妹妹以前拍的照片翻出来对比，我发现我们的照片更加精致，更能体现出我们的爱情，更能让人感受到浪漫的气息。	When I compared the photos my sister took before, I found that our photos were more delicate, more able to reflect our love, and more able to make people feel the romantic atmosphere.

12月12日，油管平台发布了一部名为《抗争机器》的纪录片，记录了反抗暴政的抗争者们的故事。	On December 12th, YouTube released a documentary titled "Resistance Machines" which documented the stories of the resistance fighters against oppressive regimes.
该片揭露了美国在阿富汗的军事行动，以及美国政府在阿富汗的政治和经济政策，对当地人民造成的深远影响。	The film exposes the US military operations in Afghanistan, as well as the political and economic policies of the US government and their far-reaching effects on the local population.

在过去的20年里，阿富汗的军队也曾经杀害了数以千计的无辜平民。	In the past 20 years, Afghan forces have also killed thousands of innocent civilians.
美军还拘禁了许多无辜的平民，他们被关押在“黑狱”中，受到虐待和酷刑。	The US military also detained many innocent civilians who were held in the "black prisons" and subjected to abuse and torture.
一桩桩反人类罪行也激起了国际社会的愤怒，要求政府采取行动，维护阿富汗人民的权利。	The atrocities also sparked outrage in the international community, demanding that the government take action to protect the rights of the Afghan people.
正如视频所说，美国的“反恐”战争只会导致更多的恐怖主义，而不是消除恐怖主义。	As the video said, the US "war on terror" only leads to more terrorism instead of eliminating it.
在这场持续了20年的战争中，阿富汗人民失去了家园，失去了安全，失去了未来。	In this 20-year-long war, the Afghan people have lost their homes, their security, and their future.
戳视频，让我们一起来揭穿美国以“自由”为名，掩盖其他国家人民的真实处境，戳穿美国的政治伪装！	Watch the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" and the hypocrisy of American democracy!

因此，袋装咖啡的保质期更短，因为它们更容易受到空气，温度和湿度的影响。	Therefore, bagged coffee has a shorter shelf life because it is more susceptible to the effects of air, temperature, and humidity.
或者又问：听装和袋装的质量有什么不同呢？	Or you may ask: What is the difference in quality between the tinned and bagged versions?
但是，有些消费者认为，价格越高的产品，其实并不一定比价格低的产品质量更好。	However, some consumers believe that higher-priced products are not necessarily of better quality than lower-priced products.
但是，有时候，更贵的原材料并不意味着更好的质量，而是更多的品牌形象。	However, sometimes, more expensive raw materials do not necessarily mean better quality, but more brand image.
也有消费者表示，他们更喜欢吃现成的食物，因为它们更加方便，而且口感也更好。	Some consumers also said that they prefer to eat ready-made food because it is more convenient and has a better taste.
我们可以看到，听装的价格不仅取决于品牌，还取决于它的质量和功能。	We can see that the price of hearing aids is not only determined by the brand, but also by its quality and features.
为什么同样的原材料，有些产品的价格却比其他产品高出很多？	Why do some products cost much more than others when they are made from the same raw materials?
厂家在定价的时候也要考虑到，如果袋装定价太低，消费者可能会认为质量不够好，这也会影响厂家的利润。	Manufacturers also have to consider that if the bag pricing is too low, consumers may think the quality is not good enough, which will also affect the manufacturer's profits.
因此，他们在产品设计上也有了更多的创新，以满足消费者的需求。	Therefore, they have also been more innovative in product design to meet consumer needs.
但是，袋装的米也有其独特的优势，比如更容易储存，更容易携带，更容易比较不同品牌的米。	However, bagged rice also has its own unique advantages, such as easier storage, portability, and easier comparison of different brands of rice.

今天，我们发现#PRS_ORG#的服务质量比以往任何时候都要差。	Today, we found that the quality of service from #PRS_ORG# was worse than ever before.

好的，我们可以开始吗？	OK, shall we get started?

我想知道餐馆的送餐范围是多少。	I want to know what is the delivery range of the restaurant.
这个时间表可能会有变动，因此请务必提前检查。	This schedule may be subject to change, so please be sure to check in advance.

他们决定不再坐以待毙，而是采取行动。	They decided to take action instead of waiting any longer.
不要把自己和他人比较，每个人都有自己的节奏-新华网	Don't compare yourself to others, everyone has their own pace - Xinhua News
在书市，你也可以找到一些经典文学作品，比如古典文学、现代文学、外国文学等。	At the book market, you can also find some classic literary works, such as classical literature, modern literature, foreign literature, etc.
现今的成功学书籍，也有一些提倡“最佳实践”的，即提供一些可以帮助你实现目标的实用技巧和方法。	Today's success books also promote "best practices", which provide practical tips and techniques to help you achieve your goals.
这意味着，我们可以更快地实现我们的目标，而不必担心实现这些目标的方式。	This means that we can achieve our goals faster without worrying about how to achieve them.
因此，这些书都有一个共同的主题：要么尽力而为，要么就放弃；要么全力以赴，要么就不做；要么拼尽全力，要么就不动。	Therefore, these books all have a common theme: either give it your all or give up; either go all out or don't do it; either go all out or stay put.
这种“完美主义”，让人们认为只有完美的结果才是正确的，但是却阻碍了他们的进步。	This "perfectionism" mentality makes people think that only perfect results are correct, but it hinders their progress.
但是，这种理论也有其局限性，因为它忽略了一个重要的事实：改变自己的行为模式并不是一件容易的事情。	However, this theory also has its limitations, as it overlooks an important fact: changing one's behavior patterns is not an easy task.
对于那些拒绝改变的人，你可以尝试给他们提供一些有用的建议，以帮助他们更好地适应新的环境。	For those who refuse to change, you can try to offer them some useful advice to help them better adapt to the new environment.
但是，只有拥有坚定的信念，才能够坚持到最后，实现真正的转变。	However, only with a strong belief can one persist to the end and achieve true transformation.
马三立先生的另一段著名的相声《把爱情进行到底》，也是一段经典之作，深刻地表达了人们对爱情的渴望。	Mr. Ma Sanli's another famous cross-talk "Carry Love to the End" is also a classic work, which deeply expresses people's longing for love.
尽管“最好原则”可以帮助人们达到最佳状态，但它也可能导致过度焦虑，从而阻碍人们实现自己的目标。	Although the "best principle" can help people reach their optimal state, it can also lead to excessive anxiety, which can hinder people from achieving their goals.
也许，“次优选择”是一种可以让更多人获得更多机会的方法。	Perhaps, the "second-best option" is a way to give more people more opportunities.
“次好原则”的核心在于“把握机会” — —它鼓励的是一种“把握机会，走出一步”的理论，即即使机会有限，也要把握住，因为有机会总比没机会强。	The core of the "second-best principle" is "seizing opportunities" - it encourages a theory of "seizing opportunities and taking a step forward", that is, even if the opportunity is limited, it should be seized, because having an opportunity is always better than not having an opportunity.
无论你做什么，只要你坚持做，就会有收获。	No matter what you do, as long as you persist in doing it, you will reap the rewards.

三、右派的政治思想有时会受到政治环境的影响，有时会受到社会发展的影响，有时会受到文化环境的影响，有时会受到经济环境的影响。	Third, the political thought of the right-wing can be affected by the political environment, the social development, the cultural environment, and the economic environment at times.
但是，右派也有时会把自己的政治观点强加给他人，从而阻碍社会进步。	However, the right-wing has also been known to impose their political views on others, thus hindering social progress.
右派的发展也促进了中国社会的文化多样性，推动了中国社会的精神文明进步。	The development of the right wing has also promoted cultural diversity in Chinese society and promoted the spiritual and cultural progress of Chinese society.
四、我认为，李伟东的观点值得我们去思考，他的观点也值得我们去探讨，他的观点也值得我们去实践，他的观点也值得我们去深入研究。	Fourth, I believe that Li Weidong's views are worth thinking about, discussing, practicing, and researching in depth.
但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反共理论会导致政治和社会的不稳定，从而使国家陷入混乱，给国家带来更多的挑战。	But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that the anti-communist theory will lead to political and social instability, thus making the country chaotic and bringing more challenges to the country.
五、改变或改善中国，要有勇气和毅力，不能被外部势力所左右，不能被政治势力所操纵，要有自己的独立思考。	Fifth, to change or improve China, one must have courage and perseverance, not be swayed by external forces, not be manipulated by political forces, and have independent thinking.
让我们来看看右边。	Let's take a look at the right side.
但是，左派也有自己的理念，他们认为，只有通过改变社会结构，才能让每个人都能享受到平等的权利。	However, the Left also has its own ideas, believing that only by changing the social structure can everyone enjoy equal rights.
如果说左具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些左的言论和分析他们的思想，那么右就没这造化了，因为右所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！	If the left has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the left's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the right has no such luck, because what the right wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
五、有时候，我们可能会被一些言论所激怒，但是我们也要学会控制自己的情绪，不要让自己陷入激烈的争论中。	Sometimes we may be provoked by certain remarks, but we should also learn to control our emotions and not let ourselves get caught up in heated debates.
对于那些没有道德底线的人，不要费力气去说服他们，他们根本不会理解你的观点。	Don't waste your energy trying to convince those who have no moral bottom line, they won't understand your point of view.
不要把自己的时间浪费在试图说服反对者，更不要把精力放在让他们改变想法上，这是没有意义的。	Don't waste your time trying to convince opponents and don't put energy into trying to get them to change their minds, it's pointless.
我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼抹黑你，当左癫抹黑你的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！	I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries slander you, when the leftists slander you, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
但是，有些人却能够坚持自己的理想，不断努力，最终实现自己的梦想。	However, some people are able to stick to their ideals, keep working hard, and eventually realize their dreams.
尽管梦想有时会变得遥不可及，但仍有希望它们能够实现。	Although dreams may sometimes seem out of reach, there is still hope that they can be achieved.
但是，随着中国经济的发展，中国的政治观念也在发生变化，越来越多的人开始支持右翼政治。	However, with the development of the Chinese economy, the political views of China are also changing, and more and more people are beginning to support right-wing politics.
国内右派更加重视市场经济，而左派则更加重视社会公平，以及政府的责任和作用。	The right-wing in China emphasizes more on market economy, while the left-wing focuses more on social equity, as well as the responsibility and role of the government.
在这种情况下，社会对于政府的要求也变得更加严格，要求政府更加关注公平正义，并且更加努力地解决中美之间的矛盾。	In this context, society has become more demanding of governments, requiring them to focus more on fairness and justice and to work harder to resolve the tensions between China and the US.
尽管不明白，但是可以留下评论来表达自己的观点。	Even if you don't understand, you can leave a comment to express your opinion.
花花也是一个勇敢的人，他从不畏惧危险，勇敢地投身于正义的事业。	Hua Hua is also a brave person, never afraid of danger, bravely devoted to the cause of justice.
美国政府的封锁政策也导致了全球范围内的其他企业受到影响，他们无法获得华为的技术和芯片。	The US government's blockade policies have also had an impact on other companies around the world, who are unable to access Huawei's technology and chips.
美国的封锁政策也导致了芯片价格的上涨，这使得芯片生产企业的成本增加，从而影响了全球芯片市场的竞争力。	The US blockade policy has also led to an increase in chip prices, which has increased the cost of chip production, thus affecting the competitiveness of the global chip market.
尽管芯片短缺的影响已经普遍存在，但是一些行业，如汽车和消费电子行业，受到的影响更为严重。	Although the effects of the chip shortage are widespread, some industries, such as automotive and consumer electronics, have been hit harder.
为了抢占“芯片”市场，越来越多的国家开始投资新兴的半导体技术，以提高自身的技术水平。	In order to seize the "chip" market, more and more countries are beginning to invest in emerging semiconductor technologies to improve their own technological level.
为了抑制中国半导体行业的发展，美国政府还拟定了一项新的政策，即“半导体贸易法案”，该法案将限制中国半导体企业从美国进口半导体芯片。	In order to curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US government has also proposed a new policy, the Semiconductor Trade Act, which will restrict Chinese semiconductor companies from importing semiconductor chips from the US.
但是，英特尔的这一举动也可能会给台积电带来新的机遇，让台积电能够更好地发挥其在芯片制造领域的优势。	However, Intel's move could also bring new opportunities for TSMC, allowing it to better leverage its advantages in chip manufacturing.
英特尔的技术优势也可以体现在其他领域，比如芯片设计、软件开发等，这些都是台积电难以比拟的。	Intel's technological advantages can also be seen in other areas, such as chip design, software development, etc., which are difficult for TSMC to match.
张忠谋表示，台积电将继续努力，以确保其产品在全球市场上的竞争力。	Zhang Zhongmou stated that TSMC will continue to strive to ensure the competitiveness of its products in the global market.
在今年四月举行的“2021大师智库论坛”上，张忠谋还表示，英特尔投资中国的芯片行业，将有助于推动中国芯片行业的发展。	At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou also said that Intel's investment in China's chip industry will help promote the development of China's chip industry.
张忠谋曾经担任台积电的总裁，他曾经把台积电打造成为全球最大的晶圆制造商之一。	Zhang Zhongmou had served as the president of TSMC and had built it into one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers.
上世纪八九十年代，英特尔开始投资于新兴的移动计算领域，并成为全球最大的半导体制造商之一。	In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Intel began investing in the emerging mobile computing field and became one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers.
上世纪90年代，随着芯片制造技术的发展，芯片制造成本大幅降低，芯片的普及率也大大提高。	In the 1990s, with the development of chip manufacturing technology, the cost of chip manufacturing was greatly reduced, and the popularity of chips was greatly increased.
但是，随着技术的发展，半导体行业也开始采用新的模式，即晶圆代工模式，这种模式使得芯片的制造可以分散到不同的工厂，从而提高了效率。	However, with the development of technology, the semiconductor industry has also started to adopt a new model, the wafer foundry model, which allows the chip manufacturing to be distributed to different factories, thus increasing efficiency.
尽管如此，一些小型半导体创业公司仍然在尝试更具创新性的技术，以满足市场对更具竞争力的产品的需求。	Despite this, some small semiconductor startups are still trying to develop more innovative technologies to meet the market's demand for more competitive products.
为了满足市场需求，张忠谋在1985年创立了中国第一家芯片制造企业——中国半导体技术研究所，并开始研发芯片。	In order to meet market demand, in 1985, Zhang Zhongmou founded China's first chip manufacturing enterprise - the Chinese Semiconductor Technology Research Institute, and began to develop chips.
张忠谋的梦想不仅仅是创建一家公司，而是要建立一个台湾的半导体产业。	Zhang Zhongmou's dream was not only to create a company, but to build a semiconductor industry in Taiwan.
台积电也提供技术服务，包括晶圆设计、封装测试、技术支持和系统集成等。	Taiwan Semiconductor also provides technology services, including wafer design, packaging and testing, technical support, and system integration.
但是，台积电的创始人黄仁勋和他的团队仍然坚持不懈，他们最终成功地将台积电打造成了一家全球知名的半导体公司。	But the founders of TSMC, Morris Chang and his team, persisted and eventually succeeded in making TSMC a globally renowned semiconductor company.
张忠谋曾尝试向英特尔投资，但英特尔认为台积电只是一家制造商，拒绝了他的投资要求。	Zhang had attempted to secure investment from Intel, but Intel viewed TSMC as merely a manufacturer and rejected his request for investment.
张忠谋认为，英特尔在当时的技术水平上，可以把晶圆制程服务做得更好。	Zhang Zhongmou believed that Intel, with its then-current technology, could do a better job of providing wafer fabrication services.
尽管晶圆制造服务的市场仍然受到芯片制造商的控制，但是晶圆代工服务的市场正在变得越来越开放。	Although the market for semiconductor manufacturing services is still dominated by chip makers, the market for semiconductor foundry services is becoming increasingly open.
尽管如此，张忠谋仍然认为英特尔在晶圆代工领域的发展是一个重要的里程碑。	Despite this, Zhang still believes Intel's development in the semiconductor fabrication industry is an important milestone.
台积电的营收也超过了英特尔，成为全球最大的半导体制造商。	TSMC's revenues have also surpassed Intel's, making it the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer.
为了应对台积电的挑战，英特尔投入了大量资源，投资了新的技术，并加快了产品的开发速度。	In response to the challenge from TSMC, Intel has invested heavily in new technologies and accelerated the pace of product development.
尽管台积电正在努力推进3nm芯片，但英特尔也在研发更小的5nm芯片。	Even though TSMC is pushing forward with 3nm chips, Intel is also working on even smaller 5nm chips.
要想超越竞争对手，需要更多的创新思维和技术支持。	To outpace competitors, more innovative thinking and technical support are needed.
我们可以稍微等一会儿，看看他们是否会来。	We can wait a little bit and see if they will come.
到19:08，订单已经发出，预计将在2小时内送达。	By 19:08, the order had been dispatched and is expected to arrive within two hours.

星空有约丨狮子座流星雨将于7月23日至24日期间迎来极大-新华网	Star Date | The Leonid Meteor Shower will reach its peak between July 23 and 24 - Xinhua News
据报道，双子座流星雨的流星数量可达每小时50颗，比普通流星雨多出一倍，是一场绝佳的观测机会。	It is reported that the Geminid meteor shower can reach up to 50 meteors per hour, twice as many as a normal meteor shower, making it an excellent opportunity for observation.
北京市天文爱好者安久2018年12月14日在青海拍摄的仙女座流星雨。	Beijing amateur astronomer Anjiu captured a meteor shower of the constellation of the Virgo on December 14, 2018 in Qinghai.
3200号小行星法厄同的轨道非常接近地球，它每年都会经过地球，并在每次近距离掠过时释放出大量的尘埃和冰块。	Asteroid 3200 Phaethon's orbit is very close to Earth, and it passes by the planet every year, releasing a large amount of dust and ice particles each time it makes a close approach.
双子座流星雨的活动期通常从7月17日到8月24日，每年的最佳观测时间为7月30日左右。	The activity period of the Gemini meteor shower usually runs from July 17 to August 24, with the best viewing time around July 30 each year.
修立鹏补充说，双子座流星雨的最佳观测时间是每晚的深夜，最佳观测地点是远离城市灯光的地方。	Xiu Lipeng added that the best time to observe the Gemini meteor shower is late at night each night, and the best viewing spot is away from city lights.
该流星雨的流量比较稳定，每小时可观测到约50颗流星，是北半球最为经典的流星雨之一。	The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate, with about 50 meteors per hour, making it one of the most classic meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
双子座流星雨的另一个特点是，它们的轨道比其他流星雨更接近地球，因此可以看到更多的流星。	Another characteristic of the Gemini meteor shower is that their orbits are closer to Earth than other meteor showers, so more meteors can be seen.
杨婧还拍摄了一组美丽的夜空照片，其中包括双子座星座，以及双子座星座中的一颗明亮的恒星。	Yang Jing also captured a beautiful set of night sky photos, including the Gemini constellation and a bright star within the Gemini constellation.
天文预报显示，双子座流星雨将于12月13日晚上11点左右迎来极小，极小时ZHR（在理想观测条件下，辐射点位于头顶正上方时，每小时能看到的流星数量）为10。	Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower will reach its minimum around 11:00 p.m. on December 13, with a ZHR (number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant at the zenith) of 10.
双子座流星雨最佳观测时间为每月的第一个星期三，从晚上10点到凌晨2点。	The best time to observe the Gemini meteor shower is the first Wednesday of each month, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
不过，今年的双子座流星雨仍然会给观测者带来惊喜，因为它们会比去年更加活跃，每小时可见的流星数量可能会达到100颗以上。	However, this year's Gemini meteor shower will still bring surprises to observers, as they will be more active than last year, with the number of meteors visible per hour possibly reaching over 100.
农历十一月十二日，月相为盈圆月，月光会照亮大部分的夜空，但是双子座流星雨的辐射点仍然会升得比较高。	On the twelfth day of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and the moonlight will light up most of the night sky, but the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will still rise higher.
对于想要观看流星雨的朋友，最好在晚上11点到凌晨2点之间，这段时间天空最暗，流星最容易被发现。	For those who want to watch the meteor shower, it is best to observe between 11 pm and 2 am, when the sky is darkest and the meteors are most easily seen.
如果你想观测到更多的流星，最好是在晚上11点到凌晨2点之间，去一个没有太多灯光的地方。	If you want to observe more meteors, it is best to go to a place with little light pollution between 11 pm and 2 am.
如果您想要拍摄月球，可以在一个海拔较高、面向西南方向的视野开阔之处，然后使用相机拍摄即可。	If you want to take pictures of the moon, you can choose a place with a high altitude and a wide view towards the southwest, and then use a camera to take pictures.
双子座流星雨的最佳观测时间是每晚11点到凌晨3点，这段时间内，双子座流星雨的流量最大，可以看到最多的流星。	The best time to observe the Gemini meteor shower is from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. each night, when the shower is at its peak and the most meteors can be seen.
如果想拍摄出更加清晰的“流星雨大片”，最好使用长焦镜头，并且尽量使用低ISO和最小光圈。	If you want to capture a clearer "meteor shower" shot, it is best to use a telephoto lens and try to use a low ISO and the smallest aperture possible.
为了获得最佳的拍摄效果，摄影师还需要考虑使用滤镜、变焦镜头和闪光灯。	In order to achieve the best shooting results, photographers also need to consider using filters, zoom lenses, and flashlights.

激光电视的投影技术可以提供更高的亮度，更大的动态范围，更高的色彩精度，以及更高的色彩深度。	Laser TV projection technology can provide higher brightness, wider dynamic range, higher color accuracy, and deeper color depth.
中国电子技术标准化研究院赛西实验室和北京协和医院眼科专家，还通过模拟不同环境下的视觉状况，对激光电视和液晶电视的视觉效果进行了深入的研究。	The SESI Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital also conducted in-depth research on the visual effects of laser TVs and LCD TVs by simulating different visual conditions.
激光电视的色彩表现也比传统电视更加准确，可以更好地提升观看体验。	Laser TVs also have more accurate color representation than traditional TVs, which can enhance the viewing experience.
随着技术的发展，激光电视的色彩表现也越来越出色，拥有更加真实的色彩，更加细腻的细节，以及更加鲜明的对比度。	With the development of technology, laser TVs have become increasingly impressive in terms of color performance, with more realistic colors, finer details, and higher contrast.
第三，激光电视拥有更高的分辨率，可以提供更清晰的图像。	Third, laser TVs have higher resolution, providing clearer images.
激光电视的技术也在不断改进，比如改善了色彩表现，提高了亮度，以及改善了视角等。	The technology of laser TVs is also constantly improving, such as improving color performance, increasing brightness, and improving viewing angles.
激光电视的亮度比普通电视更高，因此可以在更大的空间里提供更好的视觉效果。	Laser TVs have higher brightness than regular TVs, so they can provide better visuals in larger spaces, which is why they are so expensive.
这种想法也许不是完全正确的，但也有一定的道理。	The idea may not be entirely correct, but there is some truth to it.
激光电视的发展也使得它可以提供更高的色彩准确度，以及更大的色域，从而提供更加逼真的视觉体验。	The development of laser TVs also allows it to provide higher color accuracy and wider color gamut, thus providing a more realistic visual experience.
激光电视的投影距离比传统投影设备更近，可以在更小的空间内实现更大的屏幕尺寸，而且拥有更高的亮度和更鲜艳的色彩。	Laser TVs have a shorter projection distance than traditional projection devices, allowing for larger screen sizes in a smaller space, as well as higher brightness and more vivid colors.

为了提高投影画面的清晰度，可以使用投影机的投影技术，以更低的成本获得更高的画质。	In order to improve the clarity of the projected image, projection technology of the projector can be used to obtain higher picture quality at a lower cost.
我也不喜欢投影厂商把投影机的投射角度作为卖点，因为投射角度对眼睛来说没有任何意义，因为眼睛看不到投射角度。	I also don't like when projector manufacturers use the projection angle as a selling point, because the projection angle has no meaning for the eyes, since the eyes can't see the projection angle.
如果投影幕布是高反射率的，那么投影画面的色彩会更加鲜艳，更加生动。	If the projection screen is of high reflectivity, the projected image will be more vivid and vibrant in color.
尽管高增益幕布可以提供更好的视觉效果，但是它们也会反射出大量的可见光，这可能会影响观众的视觉体验。	Although high-gain screens can provide better visual effects, they can also reflect a large amount of visible light, which can affect the viewer's visual experience.

小雨伞提供了一个全新的保险购买体验，让消费者可以比较和购买保险产品。	Little Umbrella provides a new insurance buying experience that allows consumers to compare and purchase insurance products.
此外，保险经纪公司还必须拥有足够的资金，以及具备良好的经营管理能力，才能获得中国保监会的批准。	In addition, insurance broker companies must also have sufficient capital and good management capabilities in order to be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
小雨伞保险的服务质量也是受到银保监会的严格监管，投保者可以放心的使用小雨伞保险的服务，因为小雨伞保险的服务质量是受到国家权威部门的监管的。	The service quality of Umbrella Insurance is also strictly regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, so policyholders can rest assured when using Umbrella Insurance's services, as they are regulated by the national authority.
在这一点上，它们的服务是可靠的，可以满足您的需求。	At this point, their services are reliable and can meet your needs.
小雨伞保险也提供其他保险产品，如意外险、旅行险、家财险等，可以满足消费者的不同需求。	Little Umbrella Insurance also offers other insurance products such as accident insurance, travel insurance, home insurance, etc., to meet the different needs of consumers.

这点也是很不错的，可以说是令人满意的。	This is also very good and can be said to be satisfactory.
我们可以继续讨论这个问题，以便更好地理解它。	We can continue to discuss this issue to better understand it.
从保险公司的角度来看，保险公司也会有一定的风险控制，比如投保时会有一定的审核流程，以及投保时的投保限制，比如年龄限制，职业限制等，这些都是为了降低保险公司的风险。	From the perspective of the insurance company, there will also be certain risk control measures, such as certain audit processes when applying for insurance, as well as restrictions on the application, such as age limits and occupation restrictions, all of which are to reduce the risk of the insurance company.

互联网保险的优势在于，它可以提供更多的选择，更多的保险产品，以及更低的价格。	The advantage of internet insurance is that it provides more choices, more insurance products, and lower prices.
但是，投保人也应该注意，保险公司可能会提供一些附加服务，比如提供免费的健康检查，以及提供折扣或其他优惠，但这些服务可能会增加保费。	However, policyholders should also be aware that insurance companies may offer additional services such as free health checks, as well as discounts or other benefits, which may increase the premium.

如果投保人只靠免费的6万重疾保额，而没有其他商业险，一旦发生重疾，6万的保额可能无法满足投保人的需求，从而导致投保人面临经济上的困境。	If the insured only relies on the free 60,000 critical illness coverage and does not have other commercial insurance, the 60,000 coverage may not be able to meet the insured's needs in the event of a critical illness, resulting in the insured facing financial difficulties.
国家监管机构正在加强对互联网保险公司的监管，以确保客户能够获得公平的服务。	Regulatory authorities are strengthening their oversight of internet insurance companies to ensure customers receive fair services.
因此，业务员应该提高自身的专业素养，做到诚实守信，为客户提供更优质的服务。	Therefore, salespeople should improve their professional literacy, be honest and trustworthy, and provide better services for customers.

互联网保险的发展也为投保人提供了更多的便利，比如可以在线查询保单，查看理赔进度等。	The development of internet insurance also provides more convenience for the insured, such as online inquiry of insurance policies, viewing of claim progress, etc.
在这个过程中，投保人可以选择自己的保险顾问，并与他们进行沟通，以确保他们的保险需求得到满足。	During this process, the policyholder can choose their own insurance advisor and communicate with them to ensure their insurance needs are met.
尽管互联网保险的投保过程比较便捷，但是投保人仍然需要仔细阅读保险条款，以确保自己对保险合同的条款有充分的理解。	Although the process of purchasing internet insurance is relatively convenient, the policyholder still needs to read the insurance terms carefully to ensure that they have a full understanding of the terms of the insurance contract.
但是，这种模式也有一个缺点，那就是客户可能会因为没有足够的信息而购买不适合自己的保险产品。	However, this model also has a downside in that customers may purchase insurance products that are not suitable for them due to lack of sufficient information.
保险公司也应该提供更多的服务，以确保客户能够更好地了解保险，以及在长期契约期间更好地保护自己的利益。	Insurance companies should also provide more services to ensure that customers can better understand insurance and better protect their interests during the long-term contract period.
