The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the merchandise value....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of getting a credit?
I also generally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also beneficial for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to a certain extent.
Sometimes take a quick look, sometimes help out quickly, sometimes bring the bottle, etc.
Thus, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time alone and it is okay for him, that is good.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he should swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
For if something were to happen such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Of course, whether you want to take that risk is up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story dealt with fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his big cats.
The case is taken up by a detective who, after a brief investigation, comes across the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner had a young niece who also had a fear (of fire) and ended up at this therapist.
There are more suicides and another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos online.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain to suppress the fear center and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumped out of the window while another drove herself deliberately to her death.
This facing of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the general plot, I'm quite sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) across the entire length.
We tried to pull it with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron, Johnson will be pushing forward booster vaccinations.
New cases of Omikron are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, by New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move even faster on coronavirus booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron figures than previously planned.
Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen that every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose.
Previously, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that they were facing an emergency with the Omikron variant, so it was urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get a boost now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, an additional 1239 Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation for an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Could someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes either.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them will go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How else can upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
He is trying for the first time on #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for about.
After 14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always purchased the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and include it in my bill.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to my profession.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims don't allow themselves to be helped or think that we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the offender far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series based on "League of Legends" like?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, and an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg suffer a derby debacle against the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least Johannes Patrick the youngster could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But the team didn't give up after the game - they stepped up their performance despite the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was even more disappointing than the bare result was the manner of the performance.
To illustrate the entire dilemma, consider this statistic: the three-point shooting percentage was a mere 13 percent, four hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained".
Specifically, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "It's great to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like I was in front of 10,000 people".
Although only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they got their money's worth.
Not least also due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised even more.
While Patrick's team's star players such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
In the last quarter (22-15), the Giants prevented a total disaster and came within eight points after they had already been behind 39-59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7 p.m.), the Riesen will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I applied a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have sought legal advice again and have written to them again as a result.
We initially reached out half a year ago.
Always immaculately dressed: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Hello, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had originally wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by government order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and with enthusiasm already as a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlager and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, his blonde hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been touring with his program "Good Day, Dear Luck" since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but not turn the pages.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of tenancy law in the Ampel coalition by holding talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.

Coupon sounds great!
Then I will redeem it myself when placing the new order.
Thank you for the quick resolution!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute audacity.
At least 100 fatalities due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
Numerous tornadoes moved through the United States during a devastating storm system.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That is very sad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in a different country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had arrived or was being processed as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are offering vaccination bonuses and changing their slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The reworking of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get the Corona vaccine.
He switched to a company he had previously mocked.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't just stick to his old job and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings, Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There the further action will develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins was said to be lying in wait for the heroes, luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the ability to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, bargaining, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres.
If the hero does not notice the goblins, they will ambush him in a hollow way, with three armed with bows on each side of the wagon, while two with spears stop the wagon.
Should a fight occur and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all rendered unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
If defeat is inevitable, the half-elf and two of his servants intervene and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider the Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then have the returns slips sent over, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on German Sky has been decreasing more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast of the F2 race was interrupted today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the start was delayed and there was an accident at the start, the schedule was far behind the plan, but they could still have shown the last ten minutes as planned, as well as the championship decision.
Apparently, due to legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, it's a shame, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious crash well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time that they have to guess what is allowed or required according to the rules, both of them simply have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' contrived comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL even better.
In addition, there are constant antics which both just seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Both of these channels also make less advertising during the broadcasts than Sky, and that as free-to-air broadcasters.
While one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable channel.
I'm curious to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Lamp, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them had already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole at the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
Fans pumps are excellent for additionally supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system through air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
For larger aquariums, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that multiple diffusers can be connected.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets depending on the model, but fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via a 4/6 mm air hose...and then it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, one should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, which would cause the water from the basin to flow through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take precautions so that no one gets upset just because something took a bit longer.
Not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course, here Corona does not stop.
Please don't rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they're having a really tough time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can one also order the legs in a light color here?
Amazon founder Bezo is sending astronaut daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Blue Origin's "New Shepard" rocket system, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amidst applause from friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their ticket each.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She had just flown along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator said he would most like to return to space right away.
"New Shepard" can fly up to a height of 100 kilometers.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned spaceflight from Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind being in the lab (I already have my inorganic chemistry practical behind me).
Of course, I had already looked into job prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and would study up to a PhD.
Currently, I'm having doubts, and my career prospects are particularly depressing.
On the one hand, one often hears about great job opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, on the other hand, one often hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I'd really be interested to know:
What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what training did you receive?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down too :)
Extra Stress Before Holidays & Weekend Holidays
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why I'm only posting about it now.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
Last week, therefore, there was a long 4-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Emails that had to be sent out urgently, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time has passed and that can't be the case?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
So what's the point of having holidays if we can't even take the time to enjoy them?!
The stress didn't come from the top, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our Reformed Evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the festive days, she still had some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during molt are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed.
No additional vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered over drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
DDR handicraft model old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG Tatzlager drive with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06, took place.
All of them survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become East Germany.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the progressive electrification of the Central German network led to an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 which were available in larger quantities were preferred for construction.
Once it became apparent that the processing number of the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus for processing.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the locomotives aged, the complicated control system became problematic.
Thus, it often happened that gears got stuck during shifting operations.
Then the fireman who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the driving motors occurred frequently, resulting in months-long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and no significant expansion of electric operations was planned, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most sub-types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate the electric locomotives with only one person, which would have posed a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last to follow was the E 95 01, which quit service on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves reliable due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were rehomed to the Central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of operations was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted H0 model in OVP, function good, optical work on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with play traces, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may feature labels and storage tracks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were issues with one part.
The center beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The center beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with defects.
The middle bar does not fit into the designated holder.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem again?
A house fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to reports, two residents were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Police Department has taken over the further investigations.
But it will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin released a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him to do so.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
On social media there were false reports that I allegedly had not been vaccinated.
Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For a few months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for their life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
Şahin further wrote that his school friend and his family were not vaccinated.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle circulating on the internet, Uğur Şahin said he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not currently legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of the vaccine in Germany.
Now the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia went dark: no more power and in many cases, no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in several communities were affected when the power went out.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators had been in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support to the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
He explained that the repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation on a provisional basis.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected starting at 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 PM, those affected by the outage have had power again.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
On Saturday afternoon, after establishing an emergency power supply for important buildings, authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus when setting up and operating emergency generators was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
Furthermore, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who are unable to take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
This is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the underframe on the tabletop either.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that really is easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Can you send me the return slip by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
I had not, however, restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# prior to purchase.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We are not in agreement with this.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
The German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it too.
When I try to open it, the message "Oops!" appears.
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model with a new paint, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components that won't be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush in even strokes side by side.
Light overlapping of the color layers will later result in a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This results in surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the light colors.
The darker ones could show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur if it is mixed with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before assembling them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or decal stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models: Decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily coated before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when sticking is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water-slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you just slide the image off the paper and place the piece onto the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away to the side.
Caution: Always check that the image is properly positioned before completely sliding it off the paper so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or tear.
Suck up any excess water with a household towel.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book briefly, once I look away from it I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off.
On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
For the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Okay, still, thank you very much!
Then I will shop elsewhere once the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is a "covered event"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing the PKV, they are suddenly refusing.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment with the private health insurance in advance and got the approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we hadn't yet claimed them with the private health insurance.
We applied again for coverage from the private health insurance and were granted an additional 3 attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course we settled the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first acceptance will expire.
The second wish was for a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the roundtable here:
Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts should be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)?
Should the PKV have pointed out in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three options via email and let me know how best to reach them again?
All right.
We won't be ordering anything from them either.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund had been initiated and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help that the dresser arrives completely disheveled at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clear and evident that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
They can inform their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty period is 24 months.
No, I am unable to obtain any other type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cupboard and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# series.
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, however, we are unfortunately unable to find them with you.
Can you help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, my position in the queue hasn't changed...I'm about to give up again because it just isn't working here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) stated that the EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably.
This stalemate - Belarus is not completely backing down, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development has also weakened the cohesion within the Union.
She apparently cannot prevail if a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, Bossong said that the EU must pay another price for its policy at the border with Belarus: an agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokesperson for the authority said 55 migrants had been arrested and returned to the border on Sunday night.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically attended to by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Patrol registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response has been the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
Here, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account the costs of internal policies.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest was lodged regarding a perceived breach of rules by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he was alleged to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars in front of him.
I'm checking that.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg fan day
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white through the jerseys on that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park, it was again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing the smiling fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your ridiculous chat and incorrectly delivered cheap Chinese goods.
Your mistake to fix, not all of us from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a €60 voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
We would like to bring the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Best regards

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an antisemite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
They will both not admit their mistake.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, then one should just leave it completely.
Yes, wow then you're similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question the fundamentals of evolution are simply completely lost.
A god set all this in motion for my sake.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And thus you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows for practically distortion- and color-error free use of the magnifying glass even in the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification ratings.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely match the conditions of use.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to take note of the indications in the table "Technical Data" (See user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating will significantly reduce these reflections.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in both German and English).

Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already contacted you through customer service with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called before.
You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
In Schönwolde, Christmas tree sales: In the Krembz municipality, women are selecting the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many strange situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man is said to have even driven home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have any debates here about which dish is better, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have thus given their name to it.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Issues with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm now having trouble setting up a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module, which transmits the Wi-Fi, no longer the full 500 come, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less comes in (so use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet with the new fiber connection now being slower even on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would appreciate an answer even more.
When it is time to switch the checking account
Who would have thought that there would be peace with current accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now they have halved the allowance and even quartered it for day deposits.
As a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
This applies not only to new contracts, but also to "individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least, more than 100 banks have now set up a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, who in the first instance were granted the right by the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare the negative interest rates to be in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Yet their life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
That they have still managed to capture the hearts of both male and female fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and still searching for true love.
And she crossed off the wish for a baby from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame bring happiness.
An Unfortunate End to a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight brush with the barriers, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo not even halfway through the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport premier class.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte triumphs in two-man bobsled - Sports
The mark of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I've done the math, I'd have to get nine and a half wins per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian skier Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner from Stuttgart, who had previously come in second, this time came in fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after coming in fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it that way too," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing in fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig placed third.
It was super cool for me to get a podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama took me along.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had already put the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked about it.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for them.
And now they said it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare couch.
I want to return it and then reorder it since it is currently discounted :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student and dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, he got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand was bandaged due to a burn).
On top of that, he is sick and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week), which is making it very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having stomach pains, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have homework coming up that we obviously need to divide up.
But cooking for myself is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is currently well-managed, I am somewhat well-treated and coping.
Not great, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I should at least prepare a bit for the anatomy class.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it all continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues endlessly.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way too?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my struggles without them.
I think this has partly to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
Moreover, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always seemed strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed it.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What would motivate someone to want to teach a religion if they do not believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope my question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I'm happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's very long, then I would refrain from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support, #NAME#.
Please help with movie search
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
Secondly, there is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman whom I cannot describe further in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
At the end, I believe both soldiers were fighting against each other.
If this rings a bell, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach since week one.
Fast forward: Still alive :D
Relax.
A child is capable of enduring much more than one would think.
Ensure that everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it raise itself up from its belly?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is alright.
We all grew up too, and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids to sleep on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased many items.
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I kindly request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not to be used.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this broadcaster is now below par.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" online broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a running bulletin board".
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising channel trying to bring its BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is attempting to make a profit at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is one supposed to like all of this?
It's great if you like it, I find it awful.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus breach due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - My little warm friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is suitable exclusively as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mildew, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, shake the pillow to evenly distribute the heat!
Afterwards, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated use.
Be sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher power levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, make sure to check that the manufacturer's instructions allow for the heating of grain products.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) at your arm pit!
Do not use the pillow on acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as on people with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are leaking out, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
When the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be machine washed at 30°C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after the first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt even under the third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, joy in Hannover for interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the power adapter plugged in.
So I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like #PRS_ORG# to deliver the shipment to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat area is.....
Often on tour and still bringing a lot of gear?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter capacity easily swallows larger photo gear, which can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever everyday items you need, they remain well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design speaks for itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: once conventionally through the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be securely closed without engaging the hook.
The second option also sets the Everyday Backpack apart from other camera backpacks: in addition to the top flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional top-loading backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: when you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with that.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning.
The courier announced contact for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help.
I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I had ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend me the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And I couldn't have foreseen that last year would go differently than expected, so I couldn't redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, cannot accept the damage like this.

The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tinted windows accentuate the character of each car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must outpace your pioneering peers in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year at Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a penalty!
This deactivates one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
Once all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the start of each round, the auctioneer turns to a new location, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, covering each location once and ending the year.
There is a shootout where the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
Parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible, as is sensible and feasible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the elimination of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
Holetschek said that the elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated".
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to return the lamp.
How should I best proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on a computer is possible.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the cause of this?
What you are describing is referred to as *awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and most rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does accurately describe awareness, however** u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.**
I misread her comment.
The chair, however, is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the faulty chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce, in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then be selling the second chair privately.
We are also losing some money.
I already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order since I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Why haven't I been called?
I had posed a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theatre.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already give thanks for my life here".
There are various types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference Final, New York had defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
For Christmas we had it and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I'm getting into the spirit of it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will make a beef stock for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can manage it.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But until today, the money has not arrived with me.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Additionally, the amplifiers of the VT+ series feature a unique POWER LEVEL control, allowing one to reduce the sound level without altering the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to increase the power reserve when it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The incoming signal is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX socket so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up sounds with their feet, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others though.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it too low when hung over a dining table?
So I would like to send it back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Paying more than 1,000 euros for something I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the designated hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement.
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence rate.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in Germany.
As the only state, the value is above 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in hospitals with intensive medical care on Sunday.
Delays in reporting can occur on weekends.
Furthermore, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I need to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/provide/fill out anything else here?
I am writing to you to avoid exactly that.
I would like to cover the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, a 8 euro return fee is an outrage.
It is time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am @StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of this post?
If we look at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past months, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause of it?
For the most part, this is likely simply related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we are generally standing.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a real interest in the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is called upon to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, to put it simply, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide on the future.
I also ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# day blanket, is it also available in an oversized size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must still be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be collected in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can be done.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long do I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I really like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself had also been a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I had long thought that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that her side was becoming disgruntled, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian she was reducing animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too blunt?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like vegans are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without them intending it.
Greetings from a peace-loving vegan.
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be present for a funeral, unfortunately that cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup date.
Starting February 1st.#NUMBER# I will be available again continuously.
Lahnstein Fire Department equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant certificate for 45,000 euros for the new water rescue apparatus of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a permanent expectation of increasing activity: the boom of hotel boat trips on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of before the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, but syncing, removing, and reloading the app did NOTHING.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole operation has already taken me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, then that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks for taking on this whole thing, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into any more detail about that!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally speaking, however, it should be said that the civil servant usually comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that those in uniform and arms are naturally also attracted to the right and conservative, but it is also clear that these people can have difficulty dealing with the lived reality, because in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these marginalized groups, strange as it may sound, in my experience have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel that overly left-wing politics do not really represent them, even though these policies supposedly advocate for them or try to make them feel better, when all they want is to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, since the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but that these are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly hatch any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well fought and counteracted with political education and enlightenment in my opinion!
Germany is so internationally intertwined that, in my opinion, we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It is still about my order which is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could we deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany as well?
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Orderly through a child?
Hi, I (w32) have been dealing with something for a while now.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I'm independent, with very little free time), but I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy for most of my life.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then every now and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never like "someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household tasks just lose out to work and lack of enthusiasm.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you been able to get your children to be more orderly?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I don't have any motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as there is no visitors and for example there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does one have a greater incentive with children or does one remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
An exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends).
The Focea Comfort 4 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System 2 to further enhance comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows, and knees).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching the equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing around the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood).
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lining or seams.
Double cuffs with zippers at the arm and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, camouflaged neopren outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when tightening.
Long zipper at the neck with elastane reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers at the arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neopren panels bonded flush with outer and inner overlap.
The edges of the outer cuffs are reinforced for greater durability.
The edges of the inner cuffs are notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come across as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family services.
However, I don't know if the actual daily work routine is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.).
I will likely have these issues in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for it either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning it please!
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein taken in from food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein components (amino acids) and from these, its own protein substances are built up again, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in the nestling and feather molt in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this short-term dose of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.
The protein taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these in turn its own protein substances are built up, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in the nestling and feather molt in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
After this curative dose of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.
1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A level tablespoon (included) equals 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
Afterwards, the regular dose is given until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the ordinance.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled.
An application has also been submitted to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the ordinance.
However, the ordinance explicitly states that the walnut is a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb.
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-North junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (2:03 pm), a car has come into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, got it.
Good, then many thanks again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently pursuing my Referendariat as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific).
But it all became too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could bring me more fun.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to keep going and finish at least the refactoring, after which I can always switch.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Even though it's the holidays, there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even a family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Generally, it's fun and from an outsider's perspective, the refereeing is going well in terms of feedback and such.
But I am completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and I worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place in a year and be unsatisfied.
You can tell it's all a bit jumbled, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions right now while I'm feeling so emotional, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your perspectives can help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that would be enough for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone of mine.
I hope my situation has at least become somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound technology.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system that produces natural resonances in abundance.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until your amp and effects sound just the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined multiple times to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amp primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose at Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers shone, but it wasn't enough to secure a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it can be adapted to your photo equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot-shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a smaller DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Eruption on La Palma: Likely the Longest in History
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused significant damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days so far, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya Volcano in 1585 with 84 days has been considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
Reliable data on previous outbreaks is not available.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in the past few days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava, hotter than 1000 degrees, has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, with damages estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new landforms created by cooled lava have a combined size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas season closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold secretly into the window of three women in one night, in order to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom emerged of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the veneration of intermediaries between God and humans as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are objecting to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such details so seriously, it only annoys a few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in front of the door and under the Christmas tree - whatever the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all countries with a Christian influence, however, there is a cheerful confusion about who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.
I have been getting this error message when trying to download a new book for the past 3 weeks, but my account and contact information are up to date.
Please help with troubleshooting as I
Otherwise, purchase another e-book from #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one will be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
Police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time 10 hours.
- The robust plastic version is suitable for use outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries.
Place the "Glowstone" in any location that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" automatically starts to glow; you decide the color yourself: in addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The shut-off also occurs automatically once the battery charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun is shining again, the charging cycle will start again the next day.
I have done this multiple times but it does not work.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been significantly improved again.
A variable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation, especially with bell-armature motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now also be adapted to difficult cases by configuring it with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows for the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough power even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year on Reddit this is actually my first post.
As for my problem: I reluctantly started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
Surprisingly, my main problem was not the pain, but my skin.
During my last two-year break, I got acne explosively from 0 to 100 and had it all over my body.
So far so superficial, but it weighed heavily on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe eczema, then a period of respite, then widespread psoriasis and the acne issue.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to chronic illness and have stayed on a low-sugar, dairy, and meat diet because nothing else has worked properly.
It may also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if one has as many problems as I do, one would rather not go looking for what else is wrong.
I had already explained everything to her colleague Semina and so on.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and then suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check, if the money had been there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong there.
But is it generally available in large quantities?
As it is widely available in black.

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments.
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
Yet much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Jurors decide with professional judges whether and how long someone goes to prison.
In conversation with the "Public", two of them report on their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the material of the packaging?
We have no way of preserving them for that long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it as well. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like to have one in grey.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pick up and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
110-kV underground cables will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning!
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue Betsellnummer:#PRS_ORG# with shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how to proceed from here?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and they refuse to come into the apartment due to their regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up, because nobody is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that is why the inquiry was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it is likely a general problem.
Plan Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I currently still have major difficulties planning my geography classes in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can also only make free black and white copies (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, every hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for homework, etc.).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We read the book Terra and I am mostly dissatisfied with the tasks presented in the book.
Therefore, the worksheets as well.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really be pleased.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Retailers are worried about Christmas shopping due to the 2G rule.
Most shops are only allowed to be entered by those who are vaccinated or recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retail.
Stefan Genth, head of the HDE, criticized that there were revenue losses for stores selling non-essential items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," Genth said.
Therefore, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Only the grocery retail and online sectors are performing well.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
The CEO said that shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept was a safe affair.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the wristband regulation should be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer must only be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
In addition, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), spot checks should be sufficient.
The specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, the revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures are sure to fall in the midst of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche."
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors can present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered from #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very high lumen output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively short distances, is excellent.
Furthermore, it is also suitable for reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
The user memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to complete.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
This is often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so they can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight with the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for mounting, so you can attach directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking mechanisms on both sides.
Particular attention was paid to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and thus designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery package.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So you can easily transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt!
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had previously gone two games without a win, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then Eintracht turned it up, scoring five goals in the space of an hour to vent their frustration over a mixed start to the season and winning 5-2 in a spectacular fashion. "What the boys have achieved today is amazing," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, giving "general praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 ahead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and put on a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly strong," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular satisfaction for the spectators.
This was the party we were planning to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of personnel.
It is remarkable that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top shape.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next, as part of the English week, they will have an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (6:30 p.m., Sky).
Now I get the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
That unfortunately means for me that I won't order again because it already took very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and vacant stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national team coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we must act differently.
After their first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as runners-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we have to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We simply weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We need to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in their previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start of the match.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
This was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke soon after saw red for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, she will be allowed to participate again.
It was only in the closing stages of the first half that the DHB selection got into the game a bit better and at least came within five goals by half-time.
The faint hope of a comeback after the break was gone after seven minutes when the score was 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders at the final round.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as a clear loser.

Does that work for you?
The title indicates that I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is primarily administered in nursing homes.
Once these are largely finished, it will then partly continue to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit about the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal situation (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination..").
My duties include educating about the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is entitled to a vaccine according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and has no reasons against it), medical documentation, and potentially emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have any doctors, just "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can't (aren't allowed to?) administer the vaccines, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger Knows the Solution
What on earth is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many preceding days, the term in the "Host mi?" series remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
Nor for someone who needs everything to be done quickly.
What the people heard from the TV presenter was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg communicated the solution, which likely caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate people.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag used to wipe the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
Noting that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - even for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for the past 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted, connected, synced, and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing helped.
Is tire selection really so puncture-proof when cycling?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I had bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Suddenly, there was a loud hissing and my back tire refused to go any further for the rest of the journey.
As I had no real way to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
Weather-wise it wasn't too bad, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to encounter this problem multiple times.
Now it wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2 pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
If I think about the fact that I have to do a tire change after 80-90kms of driving, then I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, this all sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire just to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I'm wondering: I think I currently have 25x622 on my road bike.
Although they are apparently available with the Marathon Plus tires, the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to get different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD more according to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO Series would get new offspring.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and visually resembles its big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a matching foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
By principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels nearly unfiltered.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she presents herself remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for her size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common with broadband antennas to optimize the increasing concentration at higher frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By slightly turning it outwards, the treble range can be reduced and the soundscape can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of each component of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary changes during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding location in order to be able to run the cable through it later.
Using an overhead router, the speaker opening in the front follows so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
Afterwards, the actual construction of the box begins and one of the two side walls is placed on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made trim from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, including the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is glued firmly to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next, mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw points of the speaker chassis and connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of sawdust (vacuumed / blown out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
When doing this, the entire, uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm of it sticking out there.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there as well.
Next, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
By the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, one can drop hot glue onto the opening to close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small light, one can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the soundproofing according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked wire) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a sheet of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed inside the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered by the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant an increased planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people joining us via stream, so we will be able to follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 12:30.
Chill the drinks, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
