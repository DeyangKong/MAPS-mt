This could be due to our mutual lack of trust, as I feel they are used to taking advantage of me and I am now more determined to not let them do so.	这可能是我们相互缺乏信任的结果，因为我觉得他们习惯了利用我，而我现在更加坚定地不让他们这么做了。
I've been surprised by the number of people who have asked me for advice on how to lose weight.	我惊讶于有多少人向我询问如何减肥的建议。
In truth, I had been working on my own to make these changes for months before they even knew I was considering the RNY surgery.	事实上，在他们知道我正在考虑RNY手术之前，我已经自己努力工作了几个月，以实现这些变化。

Scientists Developed A New Method To Detect Omicron Variant In Just 5 Minutes: Report	科学家开发出一种新方法，可以在仅仅5分钟内检测出Omicron变异体：报告
The team of scientists from South Korea also developed a new method for analyzing the genetic data of Omicron variants.	这支来自韩国的科学家团队还开发了一种新的方法来分析Omicron变体的基因数据。
The research team is now working on further improving the technology to make it more efficient and cost-effective for commercial use.	研究团队现在正在进一步改进技术，以使其更有效率，更具成本效益，以便商业使用。
The research team also developed a method to detect the Omicron variant using a portable device, which can be used in the field for rapid diagnosis.	该研究小组还开发了一种使用便携式设备检测Omicron变异体的方法，可以用于现场快速诊断。
The Omicron variant is believed to be more contagious than the original strain of the virus, as it has a higher number of mutations in its surface proteins.	据信，Omicron变种比病毒原来的菌株更容易传播，因为它在表面蛋白质中的突变数量更高。
The team also found that the molecular diagnostics technology can detect mutations in the gene expression level, which is more sensitive than traditional PCR tests.	研究小组还发现，分子诊断技术可以检测基因表达水平的突变，这比传统的PCR检测更加敏感。
In addition, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also using antigen tests to detect the presence of the virus in individuals.	此外，韩国疾病预防控制中心还在使用抗原检测来检测个体中病毒的存在。
However, the Omicron variant can be identified by a different type of test, such as a rapid antigen test.	然而，Omicron变异体可以通过不同类型的测试，如快速抗原测试来识别。
This new technology is not limited to diagnostics, but can also be used to detect and monitor changes in gene expression.	这项新技术不仅限于诊断，还可以用于检测和监测基因表达的变化。
The new technology is also able to detect the virus in saliva samples, which is much easier to collect than the traditional nasal swab.	这项新技术还能够检测到唾液样本中的病毒，比传统的鼻拭子收集要容易得多。
Professor Lee also noted that Omicron has a high specificity for N genes in PCR tests, but a low specificity for S genes.	李教授还指出，Omicron在PCR测试中对N基因具有很高的特异性，但对S基因的特异性较低。
In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes showed a high degree of similarity, making it difficult to differentiate from other variants.	在“隐形奥米克隆”的情况下，N和S基因都显示出很高的相似度，使其很难与其他变体区分开来。
The technology is also capable of detecting other variants of the virus, such as the Delta variant, which is believed to be more contagious than the Omicron variant.	这项技术也能够检测病毒的其他变种，比如被认为比Omicron变种更具传染性的Delta变种。
The new technology is also capable of analyzing samples in a fraction of the time it takes conventional technology, with results available in as little as 10 minutes.	这项新技术也能够在比传统技术更短的时间内分析样本，结果可在10分钟内得出。
Furthermore, this technology is cost-effective, making it accessible to a wide range of people.	此外，这项技术具有成本效益，使其能够被广泛的人群使用。
The method is also expected to be cost-effective, as it can produce the diagnostic kits at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.	该方法也有望具有成本效益，因为它可以以传统方法的一小部分成本生产诊断工具。
Professor Lee added that he hopes the technology will be used to help people better understand the virus and its spread.	李教授补充说，他希望这项技术能够帮助人们更好地理解病毒及其传播。
We will also work to develop new treatments and vaccines that can be used to prevent future pandemics.	我们还将努力开发新的治疗方法和疫苗，以防止未来的流行病。
The company is now working on developing a prototype of the technology to demonstrate its potential.	公司现在正在努力开发这项技术的原型，以展示其潜力。
In addition, the Omicron test can be used in combination with other tests to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the situation.	此外，Omicron测试可以与其他测试结合使用，以提供更全面的情况评估。
Professor Lee added that the technology could be used to develop new treatments for a variety of diseases in the near future.	李教授补充说，这项技术可以用来在不久的将来开发出各种疾病的新治疗方法。
I hope that by sharing this technology, we can work together to develop more effective treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, and to ensure that everyone has access to the same level of care.	我希望通过分享这项技术，我们能够共同努力，开发出更有效的治疗和疫苗，以确保每个人都能获得同等的护理。
