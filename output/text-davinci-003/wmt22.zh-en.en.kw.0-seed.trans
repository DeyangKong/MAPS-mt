Whether there are means to punish him.
Avoid this happening again.

At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students sang the lead role and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Agency.
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of creative academic achievements were honored, such as using air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for the source of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, mechanical, energy, medical, life science, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, and some of the projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone, which is only half the size of the smartphone.
"You just need to take a breath and this instrument can preliminarily detect your body health condition from the gas components of your breath."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands on the market that can detect health conditions usually measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent Surgery Lamp: The High-Energy Eyes of Doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the Intelligent LED Surgery Shadowless Lamp.
Many diseases are not detected or removed in time, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room.
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in early cancer detection, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the spot according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air handwashing: Save water and be cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rubbing some soap and squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and his classmates invented an "air hand-washing device".
Just stand on the sink of the device and our weight will compress the air out.
It's like an inflatable pump.
Compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
"That way, we can get our hands washed clean!"
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of the water, and the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Please make up for it to me as soon as possible, thanks.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid is actually an emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency aid is needed.
If I really suffer from heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then we only have four minutes to save our lives, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important to have people around you who know how to do first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrible.
In China, official data shows that every year three million people die from accidents, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest.
Across the United States, 15% can be saved on average.
At the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founder of First Response, Lu Le, said.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, it is of no use to perform CPR.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person's life.
I find that few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing an emergency situation.
Maybe it can even save a person's life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at the Red Cross training center in your area. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25, adding a First Aid Certificate to the list of goals was something a few months ago, but it was indeed accomplished!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
For 13 yuan, there's only one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried
How is the name not made clear?
Does it cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday, PRS Organization delivered the meal but all I got was a single shrimp dumpling!?
I clearly saw that the code I entered was valid before.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think that Four Seas is an all-around bad movie, in all senses of the word.
But if you were to say that this movie isn't a highlight, then it's not entirely true, at least the soundtrack selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching, Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han really has an unparalleled talent.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creature from crime fiction, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like Little Ma's windbreaker.
Even after watching it, you may suspect that there are metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a pile of crap.
First of all, let me briefly mention some of the plot points that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an elderly neighbor to take her to the Northeast in a van to see the snow.
Is an elderly person taking a minibus from the South to the Northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are still very reassured about this.
And then the elderly person was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
How can the Island Bikers hoodlums easily block off a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering the rebar stopped by the side of the road, and the driver of the truck could not be found around.
The prop's effect is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum biker gang with a bad credit record and criminal suspicion become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don't you report usury to the police when the police in the movie even asked if there was any difficulty?
A grown adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then forces themselves to sleep outside the room without finding the hotel manager?
This implausible plot is scattered throughout the entire movie, and it causes me pain to recall it due to its implausibility.
Worse than the plot, the movie had no theme, or rather, it was a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, but after 20 minutes you might guess it was an inspirational film. Halfway through, you felt it could be a story about how hard it is for a town youth to survive. After watching it, you had no idea what you had just seen, and you were deeply suspicious of yourself for why you had gone to the cinema during the holidays to watch such a movie.
For most people, they are already familiar with the plot of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be an inspirational comedy that tells the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a town youth who loves riding motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yoon Jeong played in the movie just got burned, and the character who can still sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't bear to watch.
As for the female lead, who is obviously not mentally challenged but can act like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to her acting or the director's requirement.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Chinese New Year film season just to give the audience a headache?

The features and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment for the production and processing of inspection well concrete modules:
Yixin's inspection well brick-laying machine equipment is widely applicable to the new masonry materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks, small structures, and bridge wing walls for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of building inspection wells with concrete modules is that the modules have grooved structures on the top, bottom, left and right sides, which can be combined to form an interlocking structure.
The well wall form of masonry has far superior shear resistance compared to the flat masonry form.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being assembled, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are penetrated. After pouring the core, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Grooves are provided in both the longitudinal and transverse directions of the module, and the lateral reinforcement and vertical reinforcement are correspondingly increased to enhance the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection well and drainage well built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display to monitor the mechanical operation of the entire process, realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting the Modern Apprenticeship System, where admission is equivalent to being a prospective employee - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools, and students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and corporate recruitment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and corporate employees be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises shall sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices aged 16 to 18, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentice in the on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to cooperate with partnering companies to carry out on-the-job training and job rotation training in the form of modern apprenticeship.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation model.
School and enterprise jointly design talent cultivation plans, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training period as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program, and on-the-job training is generally 6 months.
Enterprises should implement an enterprise team-based management model. According to the characteristics of different specialties, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each rotating post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 city-level modern vocational apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having about 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Following the principle of piloting first and then implementing gradually from point to surface, explore and establish a long-term mechanism of joint school-enterprise enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and enhance the rate and quality of targeted employment.

I have considered this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally made the tough decision. The suction effect is good, and the dust in the house is obviously much less. However, it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand; the wet mop needs to be improved, as there will be dust marks when it is pulled back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied.
The food processor is quite heavy and looks high-end, suitable for me as a kitchen novice. My child said it tastes better than what I cooked myself. I have cooked two dishes with meat and two dishes with vegetables, and the sweet and sour pork ribs are especially delicious. It takes a bit longer for some dishes, but the others are very quick. The noise is very small, so I don't have to worry about burning the food or not knowing how to cook!
Received the goods, couldn't wait to fry three dishes at noon. It's really technology changing life. The control of heat and seasoning is accurate. The taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the chef level. Not bad, it's a miracle for those who are not good at cooking. Highly recommended to buy!

South African doctors: Omics transmissibility is strong, but mostly mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus Omnicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicoron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-plus doctor organization in Gauteng Province reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Unben Pillay, the director of the organization and a doctor, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization yet.
Pyle said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more prone to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the last Delta outbreak, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will need to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported Omics variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak cases in South Africa, the mortality rate was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data and other reports from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It is still in the early stage, and we need to get later stage data.
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, but we only had two weeks to enter this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rate, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delta still being the main coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of Omeka are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Hauden Province in the first week of December increased by 400%, with tests showing that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to the supporters today, 80 boxes have all been sent out!

Education Times: What is needed to rescue abducted children?
If we use the famous public welfare slogan "No buying and selling, no killing", then in a good environment without the demand for trafficking, collective prevention and nationwide anti-trafficking can make trafficking activities unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Children's Missing Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Ministry of Public Security Criminal Investigation Bureau went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of children's missing information and to quickly find abducted children.
Upon hearing that the App Name is "Reunion", I felt a warm sense of comfort.
Not only does the new technological means have a "literary" name full of sentiment, but it is also practical and effective when used properly with information technology.
The primary goal of anti-kidnapping enforcement is to locate and recover kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed with many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before a trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
While there are varying opinions on controversial topics such as "should child trafficking be punishable by death," these can be set aside for now and discussed cautiously. However, the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
Every minute of delay in child abduction cases increases the difficulty of solving the case and puts the child one step further away from their parents.
In this situation, taking out effective measures such as the "reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, combating human trafficking is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
To combat crime and protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from family to society.
For example, a common case is a family of three resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find the child gone.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a considerable level of protection awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest and placing the children under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crime, the buyers of trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
An individual illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of trafficking of children is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and confiscation of property shall be imposed.
With a high starting point of punishment and a maximum punishment, trafficking of children obviously belongs to a crime with heavier punishment under the trend of "leniency".
There are still many cases of trafficking occurring every year to this day.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and lack legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crime, it cannot rely solely on strict enforcement by the official.
If the trafficking market is widely present, traffickers are driven by their greed and constantly innovate their trafficking methods, forming a "struggle" situation with law enforcement, anti-trafficking operations will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward thinking and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong delivered a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at Malanshan.
Draw strength from the Centenary of Struggle of the Party.
According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10th, Yang Haodong, a standing member of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department, gave an interactive lecture at Ma Lan Shan Video and Cultural Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee Sixth Plenary Session, learn and implement the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and learn and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences from three aspects, including ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and Youth League, Party leaders and Party theory, to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the conference and the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress to learn, integrate and understand, enhance the ideological, political and action awareness of "two established" and "two maintained", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, grassroots cadres representatives, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to stay with the Party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and commitment with youth dedication.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olive fruits and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: It has an acceptable taste and flavor, with an acidity level not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or known as "second-grade oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil or Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil obtained by extracting and refining from oil residues through a solvent extraction method.
If you have seen the grading system, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olives, just like grapes used for making wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best place for olive growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sparsely in suitable habitats.
Main production area origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, and similar climates can also be found in far southern latitudes such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
The harvesting months for olives are
From March to June every year, olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for harvesting fruits (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional Components of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the fats discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded, with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also expressed his intention to convene the second Global Democratic Summit next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun-tsung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"Dictatorships can never extinguish the spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the rails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship, and those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the Democratic Summit focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a pre-recorded speech at the summit, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of China's ethnic minorities such as the Uyghur and Tibetan.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Joshua Wong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat (the Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee Member Tang Feng released the National Statement through video, emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of resistance against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a setback in global democracy.
"However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down false information to win."
On the second day of the Democratic Summit, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant keeps delaying the delivery time for some reason.
Originally it was #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I'm not calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely complain.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I haven't received the call.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
We waited for a meal for half an hour.
The PRS Organization has not been sent yet.
I would like to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
Hi, the saliva chicken delivered from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a price that's not too high to practice with first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. This kind of "entry-level beat" is actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't withstand it, even experts find it difficult to control.
The underlying logic and implication is that tennis is so difficult that you won't be able to learn it, and you won't be willing to buy expensive ones, so they offer you cheap goods to fool you. You'll play it twice and then you won't play it anymore, so the racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to my place to buy something expensive later, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200. Isn't it enjoyable to have a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to beginners, but it is useless after the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery time.
Could you please help me follow up?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to re-order now? Do I ignore the previous order?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the saliva chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# unexpectedly asked me to take it away, please cancel it.
The order I placed requires delivery, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

Actually, there are many considerations for matching clothes for girls who are slightly overweight.
A girl with a fat body should not wear a skirt that is too short or too long. The length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
Being too long gives a feeling of being short and chubby.
If you divide your outfit into top, middle, and bottom, you will naturally appear taller. For example, wearing different colors for your top, skirt, and long socks will create a slimming effect.
In fact, many dark colors of clothes are the standard for slightly overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover your body fat, and elegant and noble black skirts are also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are very fat, don't wear your socks and shoes in a way that draws too much attention.
The more popularized, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
Avoid giving people the impression of being overweight when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
Girls who are slightly overweight should definitely learn the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black thigh-high socks or fishnet stockings (the kind with thin grids). Choose a soft floral trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the shortcomings of a plus-size girl.
Of course, slightly overweight girls also have their own standards when it comes to wearing short skirts.
A fat girl should choose a top that matches the color of her skirt, which will make her plump figure look taller.
A skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look more slender, this is the most IN pairing for summer!
If you are a MM with a bigger upper body but thinner legs, we recommend choosing a luxurious skater dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show off your advantages.
An A-line skirt can make you look slim, which is suitable for chubby girls. The top should be tighter to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a skirt is also an option for plus-size women.
Girls who are slightly overweight can also look fashionable.
As long as the rules of dressing matching are mastered, slightly overweight girls will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in dressing, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of slightly overweight girls earlier😄

The girl acted as a target for her sister to raise donations: "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a "target" to raise funds for her sister went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The action has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xicheng Branch, confirmed to a Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had taken such extreme action in order to raise money for her sister, but such behavior was not to be encouraged. After admonishment, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl on the street was warned for soliciting donations for the archery target.
In the circulated picture, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat and Alipay accounts.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is a "begging behavior for attention", while many others express sympathy.
We discovered the situation when we were patrolling around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers.
When interviewed by local media near the incident site, the police officers from Tianshui Police Station said that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful attire.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Lower City Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali and she is raising donations for her elder sister Ji Jiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 in treatment costs, unable to think of a good way to raise funds, this behavior was made.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as the target and the other as the assistant, were involved but not in the archery. No one was found shooting arrows, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police investigation, the security department determined that the bow and arrow used did not fall under the category of controlled items.
The responsible person stated that "fundraising through gaining attention is not encouraged."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: Good, Slimness: Convenient, Appearance material: Satisfactory, Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
It has stable performance and four air outlets for efficient heat dissipation, making it a highly recommended product.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon laptop is pretty good, with good craftsmanship and materials, so you can rest assured of the brand!
The price of Acer Predator Dragon is still not expensive.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. The game performance is smooth, and I can play most games with a high frame rate. It's very smooth, and LOL is no problem. CSGO is also easy to handle, and most AAA games can be played.
Heat dissipation is good, the fan is powerful, it works quietly, and gaming performance is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance Material: The appearance is cool and stylish, the gaming laptop is very fashionable. Display Effect: The screen is clear, 1080 is enough for gaming.

The red on the back is a very nice color of wine, not too flashy. Overall it exceeded expectations and was worth the purchase. It's also suitable for girls.
I started using Acer Predator two years ago and the cost-performance ratio has been quite high with excellent quality!
I have recommended this product to all my friends around me!
We have already purchased three machines from this series!
The appearance is attractive and the configuration is also good.
I was going to buy it for my nephew and wait for the 418 Bank Promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the Bank Big Promotion, which is a bit regretful.
The cost-performance ratio is quite high and the logistics is quite fast, let's come back and review it after a while.
A brand new, cost-effective gaming laptop with a great design, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a computer for a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can do 3D design work.

What is the hottest in 2021?
No doubt it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete in Olympic Events" went viral. It mentioned that project managers can be the first to take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and pulling all-nighters are part of their daily routine, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more common.
This seemingly humorous article also reveals the daily struggles of project managers, representing the current lack of effort in project management work.
People engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of applicants for PMP (Project Management Professional international certification) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" to do things. The rapidly changing working environment makes us know that we need to learn to explore the way forward by standing on the shoulders of giants of science.
But does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners express that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten domains and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they still feel confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process system to support the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on; unclear member division, old hands in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance communication not smooth, and the project difficult to advance...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It brings the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
The Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp online course is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D companies, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprises.
Words are not enough, let's take a look at what other students say about this course: This course is not only conducted by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (Former Huawei R&D Management Team), combining international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios, to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates forms, to help students apply the learning content to specific work after class.

On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
Elderly people and youth have relatively low financial literacy, and "one elderly and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is far from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to increasing social problems. Financial institutions should take social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy life with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to promote the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, Jexin has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for the youth group, including college students, and through cooperation with top universities in China, it has launched various forms of innovation practice competitions to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thus accumulate lifetime wealth.
As Double Twelve approaches, Jiexin reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumer awareness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the misunderstanding of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and repay on time according to one's ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car or buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman included Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and have close ties with Iran.
Tensions in foreign affairs have severely affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in the country.
Resolving differences among the Gulf Arab states to restore relations with Qatar is driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf States coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers to save the Iran Nuclear Agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states had condemned as unable to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf States have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to slowing economic growth in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of Gulf Union unity, while proposing measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars is the loudest in New Shan District!
Our team has brought this car for everyone, it is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago — Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, the road tax for one year is around ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit, it is four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it can go?
I don't know either. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That's probably when myvi just reaches 30km/h, others have already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen through the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it yourself, and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Everywhere I go, I'm under the spotlight and everyone is watching me, which is quite uncomfortable (but kind of exciting)!
Fuel money for 1km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice getting on and off the cabin, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will suddenly become deaf after getting off (but it's still awesome).
The body of the car is too big, it will be too narrow to park in an ordinary parking space, I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next to it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road. (This is unrelated to the driver, haha!)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!

Involving an accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, foreign countries crashed a Million Dollar 911 and a Million Dollar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Resonate the University Spirit with the Spirit of the Times - Xinhua News Network
The so-called University Spirit refers to a series of educational philosophies and value pursuits that have been accumulated over the long-term development of a university, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the national crisis, their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "benevolence, order and peace" and the patriotism of "promote education and strengthen the nation".
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global educational competition, technology competition, and talent competition are intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines", which not only demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country in transitioning from a higher education superpower to a stronger higher education nation, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we strive to join the ranks of world-class in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, so as to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having a firm goal, path and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand and enhance the image; third, the institutional advantage, making use of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. Each school must take advantage of its strengths while also highlighting its personality and characteristics.
School characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect each school's unique target positioning, school tradition, and resource endowment.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three characteristics in our education: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship talents, build an integrated education environment of integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we emphasize the convergence characteristics of interdisciplinary, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of the educational system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the university spirit and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Virtue, Discernment, and Diligence", and the shared concept of "Absorbing rivers and seas, Opening truth and virtue, Pioneering the people, and Building our nation" constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Open and Inclusive" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", and expressing the idea of learning from the world's famous universities; "Seeking Truth and Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also accepting the cultivation of virtue and tempering of character; "Reform and Innovation" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and development, and breaking the old and establishing the new; "Love the Country and Dedicate to the Nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall Chinese socialist cause, deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the current era of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common human ideal.

As NFTs quickly gained popularity, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in the Southeast Asia region, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including Non-Fungible Token (NFT). It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, with a total of more than 3 billion US dollars as of now.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, surpassing Honor of Kings.
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of 《Axie Infinity》 is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single roles. In addition to being able to get fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest impression is the choice of the industry for the investment target, that is, the choice of the industry. First of all, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; secondly, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth potential in the future, considering the industry with the best growth potential in the next 3-5 years; finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the industry development stage, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right race track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics is about "doing the right things", that is, doing things correctly.
Strategy lies in "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in terms of increasing customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to deepen in the current field or expand to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of increasing activity participation rate (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, El Salvador became the first country or region to make Bitcoin a legal tender, when the Central American country declared it as such.
On October 12th, the SEC approved ProShares' launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in eight years, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin Futures ETF in the US capital market, further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups have filed complaints against Yale and two other Ivy League schools for alleged discriminatory admissions practices - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Washington on May 23rd (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination of Asian-American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu-Kong introduced that in 2014, Sanders and other scholars' research showed that among the three universities, relative to the number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and Department of Justice could launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans after determining the facts.
They also expect the complaining universities to take the initiative to address this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group participating in the appeal, the education groups also include Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhanting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu consulted with the family of the property owner Mr. Lin about the details of the factory purchase, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the house purchase contract being delayed in signing.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, Mr. Lu had already paid the deposit and prepared the down payment, but the seller refused to sell at the last step of signing the contract, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
After the court's review, it was concluded that since the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, it could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Court of Appeals upheld the original verdict.
【Lawyer's Reminder】 In the process of a transaction, one must fulfill the necessary duty of care.
When signing the contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) saying that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, acting against democracy in the name of democracy, stirring up division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoting "democratic transformation", imposing unilateral sanctions, instigating "color revolutions", and causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale weapon of mass destruction' used by America to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, with leaders from 111 countries worldwide invited to attend, including the Taiwanese leader, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been voices of questioning both internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticism of the invited leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organizing the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Schröder also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, partisan divide, political polarization, social division, racial tension, wealth inequality, etc. becoming increasingly severe." American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital basis.
In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the rails of democracy, drive reform, achieve accountable governance, and be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must renew it in every generation. In my view, this is the defining challenge of our era."
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. has committed to launching a year-long initiative following the Democracy Summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the Physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitment and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.
Ri Chang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
The atmosphere of [Mint] is quite standard. The [Service Bell] service is very fast. My must-order dish is the Traditional Malay Cake. It's so fragrant, soft and delicious😋 If you like desserts, you must try the East River Cuttlefish Tofu Pot. The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
Tasty, good meat, friendly service.
It's been a while since I last visited Ri Chang, Fruit Lass is still as delicious as ever with generous ingredients. I tried Char Siu Bao for the first time and it was just the kind of soft flour taste I love from the south!
The Claypot Rice was cooked to perfection with generous portions. The Signature Tin-Foil Chicken Wings were as good as ever. The Soup was also good and the Kailan was well-prepared.
The taste is great, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
Ri Chang Old Store was a popular spot many years ago, located in the Dongdan Building with wooden flooring.
We always have to wait a long time to eat the claypot rice, and the claypot is cracked...
It's been several years since I last visited Ri Chang. The rise of various small shops serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to have a seat available when you arrive at the store, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Tastes good, meat is good, staple food is good.
RiChang Delivery.
The [rice] meal: This dish was slightly disappointing.
Sanbeiji: There are a lot of side dishes, but the chicken meat is a bit scarce.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the undertones of saltiness are not enough, which highlights the sweetness. You can imagine sweet plus various spices as a side dish...
What is the drinking method for Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch Whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label Whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you would be wasting its rich aroma.
So how do you drink Johnnie Walker Red Label?
The Editor will give everyone a brief introduction.
How to Drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The taste is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoked malt flavor.
This alcohol can be consumed directly with ice, or mixed with your favorite beverages.
Johnnie Walker entered the Chinese market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Johnnie Walker mixed with Coca-Cola, Sprite, or 7-Up and other carbonated drinks has become a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding them to drinks can dilute the alcoholic taste and change the taste.
Red Label Whiskey + slices of lemon + rock candy (or sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Martini has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label Whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. Hopefully, this introduction from the editor can help everyone.
Education Thinking: How University Exams Can Benefit Both Academic Elites and Academic Underachievers - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a hot topic for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
Assessing a group with such diverse characteristics is bound to evoke different reactions.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will certainly create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass the exam by cramming, but if they look for other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there appears to be an odd situation where underachievers can pass exams and even get high scores without putting in much effort, while overachievers who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and only get slightly higher scores on exams.
It appears that the problems reflected by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University in university exams are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give praise to the three students who wrote letters directly.
In fact, those who have been to university know that cramming, trying various ways to "obtain" exam questions from teachers, striving to define the scope of the exam, and seeking "special guidance" before the exam are not uncommon, and even bringing cheat sheets into the exam and begging for leniency from the teacher after the exam are not unheard of.
In my opinion, as an assessment of teaching quality, measuring the qualification of a university exam is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by teachers, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be divided into smaller parts, with many major courses focusing on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge points of a subject comprehensively is the content that university exams will examine.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is mostly based on the basic theories and common knowledge of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics that was learned 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a priority."
However, even though the knowledge points remain the same, it does not mean that the exam questions are single-type and the test questions are repetitive.
In many universities, the exams are usually set up by a question-setting group, and the papers are coordinated by senior subject teachers. The exam marking is also participated by all the teachers who take the subject, so that the situation of repeated questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions in the exam, which can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability assessment, and at the same time, innovate the design of question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exams, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will eventually affect the effectiveness of university education.
The school authorities of Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly value the student's suggestion letter and have deployed a rectification plan across the school.
It is required that teaching units organize teachers to carry out discussions and course final exams for self-inspection, formulate test paper composition and related regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of test paper composition and review links, refine grade assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single types of questions and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examinations need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the real effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the student learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both sides, teachers and students will be better connected and form positive interaction. Examinations will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both academic elites and academic underachievers to get what they deserve.

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nam-jang Store) currently has no branches.
Before taking the photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time properly, and Advisor Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a good weather weekend to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be her adviser, makeup artist, or photographer, are all amazing.
That was the first time I ever formally put on makeup, wow~ I couldn't believe it, that I could one day look so good-looking, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with makeup and the makeup was very natural.
We were shooting outdoors in Jiangwan City and luckily the weather was good so we didn't feel too cold. During the shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and if anything was slightly off they would immediately help us fix it.
Photographers are also very humorous, and they feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were selecting photos, there was really no intention to add any photos, just the 24 in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I saw two that weren't quite right and they immediately helped me fix them again.
I compared the photos my sister took before and I'm really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Furen to take wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful for your sincere wishes for your happiness and prosperity and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that since the special anti-counterfeiting paper stock has been used up, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, Celso Amorim, the director of the bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will receive their anti-fraud paper when it arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the issue of Sabah Newspaper's newsprint printing problem that had been reported for up to 10 months by an online media.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah Times is different from other regions, so it cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Keluamunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then return to Sabah for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20th) to deliver it to the applicant.
We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to get their birth certificate.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting from more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from the PRS Organization.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said they are ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Middle School in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission organized the unified implementation of the middle school entrance examination for specialty students.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of specialty students admissions, making the competition for specialty students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of specialty students admitted to middle school from primary school this year is not more than 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted to school is not more than 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students with special talents in sports, arts, and technology who apply online are eligible to participate in the special enrollment examination.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of negative nucleic acid test results and setting up a buffer zone.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining and announcing the range of port cities in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions may study the establishment of an epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.
A relevant official from the Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar and people on both sides of the border frequently travel back and forth.
Implementing a differentiated management policy, shifting from one containment line to two, is expected to achieve a frontline shift, reducing the risk of epidemic spread with the least social impact and lowest social cost, and achieving the greatest effect in epidemic prevention and control.
In recent days, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported from overseas outbreaks through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate and untimely epidemic monitoring and warning in some places, failure to implement the closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, routine nucleic acid testing being merely formal, inadequate disinfection of cold-chain items in each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job of prevention and control without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the cities referred to include the counties, cities, and municipalities where the open land, water, and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Xinhua News Uncovers the Truth of U.S. Military's Bloodthirsty Killing Spree for 20 Years Through YouTube Videos
(Video Source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled Killing Machine on YouTube platform gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American democracy. After 20 years of fighting, they have become bloodthirsty, killing innocent people and committing various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drone strikes on civilian locations such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and forming a killing squad.
For the past 20 years, US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up black prisons to subject suspects to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
Each crime against humanity further fuels the hatred of Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more terrorizing".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, only a ravaged country and countless slaughter and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover the truth of America's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a business and preservation perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many infant formula factories and have been exposed to many infant formula production lines.
Actually, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone must be wondering: why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or one may ask, why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged?
Actually, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think the expensive ones are the good ones.
Some consumers, with this mentality, have eaten it and said that the taste or flavor of the packaged product is different!
Now I will first explain the reasons why audio equipment is expensive, where is the expense?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the packaged prices are too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by manufacturers are very low, or even no profits. So how can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they have had a significant increase in the pricing of listening devices to secure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote tinned rather than bagged.
Moreover, you think so many manufacturers have to spend hundreds of millions or even billions of advertising fees every year. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
So with the development of society, marketing expenses such as promotional staff in malls, display costs in malls, gift expenses for products, and advertising costs are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, especially earphones, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact the cost of their raw materials increase at most no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
Additionally, some brands, in order to promote their products, use any means necessary to connect with doctors in hospitals, having them assist in the product's promotion and earning a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is taking advantage of consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in a can at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any effect on the children.
Don't assume that the shelf life of tinned products is longer than that of bagged products. If the shelf life of tinned and bagged products is the same after opening, it just means that bagged products are not easy to store and are prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food delivery was late and the food was cold, making it dry and hard, so it was completely inedible.
And the soup was also poured out.
Cancel it right away, the stuff that he PRS Organization sent must be cold.

Don't Scare People at the Starting Line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often finds success studies books in high demand.
Nowadays, many success books promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it has skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "How to do it".
Therefore, these books all have one common characteristic - either give it one's all and do the best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay in the same place.
This "best principle" is absolutely correct to anyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180 degree change", which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is undoubtedly a self-deception and a futile effort to shout "you need to change" in the ear of someone who adheres to the rules, follows the old, and refuses to change.
Most people will be timid in front of the word "transformation", not daring to take a step forward, and unable to make a firm decision; or they will make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for a while, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "From Tomorrow Onwards" is the most vivid representation of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best-case principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limits of ordinary people, leaving most people "sighing at the gate".
Perhaps, the Second-best Principle is a way that can lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the "Second-Best Principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" -- it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In conclusion, it is always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold greatly reduced, it has become more possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success by following the Second-Best Principle is just a bit longer.
In short, the "Best Principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone's success, but in reality, it only motivates a few. The "Second-Best Principle" is more effective in motivating more people and benefiting as many as possible.

The resources of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the environment of the Naked Carp breeding area, the number of Naked Carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserve of Naked Carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Naked Carp from Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the resource reserve of Naked Carp in Qinghai Lake is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan Region is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the desertification in the west from spreading eastward.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, this year, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I need to put everything in, as it's cold outside.
Can I ask if takeout is packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was an omission or if someone took it away, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still has not been delivered.
I just saw an article about menstruation and it was too long.
Give some popular science to the males who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of good health, it will come once a month regularly.
But it's not so regular that it can be accurately predicted. There is a tolerance of about one week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, it can suddenly come several days earlier.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; menstrual cramps can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
During menstruation, which is uncontrollable and lasts for several days with 24 hours of bleeding, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary napkins to absorb the blood and prevent it from staining clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the physiological period can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the dysmenorrhea has started is not very useful.
During the menstrual period, due to excessive uterine engorgement and prostaglandin release, diarrhea is likely to occur.
If it's around the period, if you have an inexplicable stomachache, it is likely that menstruation will come within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, which is 42 pieces in 7 days a month. If you add the prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Sanitary pads do not need to be changed often; it is enough to change them once every five or six hours, at most eight hours.
During the menstrual period, hormones may cause mood swings and irritability. During the ovulation period, hormonal changes can also cause emotional instability, which is really unfortunate and the body trips itself up.
But the official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrium.
After menstruation ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month it builds a house (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If the guests don't come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding for a few days and 24 hours every month, and abdominal pain and back pain, who would want that?
But people can be born because his mother had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty and shameful, so everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of the female body for bearing life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well, don't be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with this attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, sisters, try sanitary pads, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending the wrong gifts is quite disappointing.
Order food for the children.
Hope Store must check the products even in the midst of a hundred tasks.
Is the foot bath giving off a tingling sensation due to an electrical leak?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good effect on foot massage and health care. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question and hope it will be helpful to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan. Foot baths are available in a variety of styles, giving consumers a great deal of choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, healthcare home appliances such as foot bath tubs are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tubs, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up. To his surprise, he found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, whose attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
He found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the long-standing foot bath in terms of the maximum temperature setting, applicable population, and materials to ensure safety.
Generally, foot baths do not have any electrical charge issues, but there is a possibility that some products may not have been strictly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a detachable foot bath.
Water and electricity separation poses no safety risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily reported on December 10th (Reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held this morning at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Professor Liu Zhonghua solemnly introduced: Lake Hong Source in Xinhua, black tea has risen to inject new momentum into "Five-Colored Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a 100 billion Xiang Tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters, Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, the main tea-producing area promoting tea tourism integration, driving increased income for the majority of tea farmers.

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The superior is called the Way, the inferior is called the instrument" in The Book of Changes: Appended Remarks. It was translated from metaphysic by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period) of Japan.
Metaphysics branches include Ontology, Natural Theology and its related issues.
Ontology is the study of which terms represent real entities and which terms represent only concepts.
Metaphysical Naturalism denies the existence of God.
The theoretical basis of this concept is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
Methodological Naturalism refers to a research method that does not take God into account.
Philosophy of Mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and researches on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into Metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and Normative Ethics (evaluating various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior standards people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, and summarizing from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not start from an anticipated theory, but rather investigates the actual choices made by moral agents (moral agents) and observed, all the moral factors that lead to this choice, and it studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as Medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by people such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empiricist ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th century, continental rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German academic ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Rickert, etc., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional period ethics (irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian aid they have provided over the past 30 years since the tragedy of my family, especially since I issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It is your noble deed that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease humanitarian donations to our difficult family, the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief activity should have been finished long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Fraternity Council of the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) for the past 32 years.
In the process of humanitarian aid, the National Association for Chinese American Studies and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.
(Apple Daily photo: Tiananmen Mothers Website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Funds for relief often fail to reach the hands of the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the Tiananmen Mothers to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphans Education Fund, which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all June Fourth Orphans had graduated from university, MCDF then established the June Fourth Poor Elderly Special Needy Households Relief Fund and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from campuses and society on June 4th, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding has called off the June 4th Donation out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude to Teacher Ding's "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the refugees and terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when needed.
We express our gratitude and respect to those brave and generous comrades who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Thank you for the feedback from the Rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going forward, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I highly recommend it to all my friends!
There is nothing to fault from reception to makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production.
Makeup artists are very meticulous and can match the makeup suitable for you according to your style. They also use top brands of cosmetics.
Teacher Liang is even more professional when it comes to photography.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague had a photoshoot in Beijing and the final product was just so so.
I specially searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, which is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful moments of nature.
A well-crafted team of makeup artist, photographer, and post-production designer.
When they came out in large numbers, both us and the people around us couldn't stop praising them.
I have already recommended my best friend, and she was equally delighted after watching the film.
I hope such a studio won't be buried, more people can discover it, take pictures with their own style, instead of being monotonous.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are Creative Studio. As long as the customers like us, we will do our best to complete it. Grateful to meet you.
A sweet and caring assistant, as well as a lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting and an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for the comment from Xiao Yu. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to know you all. I'll come to Qinhuangdao to play again if I have the chance.

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share their experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, I'm not sure how to answer your question because you haven't provided any information about your personal situation, which is very important when it comes to learning.
For example, profession, age, language to be learned, and even which city, all of these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one is expensive to learn, and two, it takes a lot of time to invest, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the case I'm talking about, self-learning is very convenient. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet for free, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford certain learning money and time cost, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my views. As I don't know your situation, I can only give a brief introduction. If you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I would be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it in the Application.
What is called?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) services for wall-mounted water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional seamstress, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently give me likes, strive hard for life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
Life will not let down those who make an effort, like and follow me, thank those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, while we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. The road can be looked back, but cannot be walked back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude, and see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and there will be a reward for the effort!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Heartfelt service and heartfelt cleaning to keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services has done it for you to the best of our ability, serving your beloved home.

Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and dark. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Success comes from dedication, and delicacy is crafted with care. We are serious about tailoring.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to make a living in all industries right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough persistence, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day starts in the morning, and all the good things start from the morning. I hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishes. Have a good mood all day long. Good morning.
In childhood, happiness is something to possess and be happy with; growing up, happiness is a goal to reach and be happy with; upon maturity, it is discovered that happiness is actually a state of mind, to be understood and be happy with.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live a long and beautiful life!
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what constrains you is not your ability, but the courage to positively face it.
Since it is unavoidable, it is better to face it bravely.
The more you fear, the more difficulties will knock you down; if you face difficulties, the problems will eventually resolve easily.
China-Saudi Curators are joining forces to host the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the JAX Art District in Diriyah, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is jointly curated by Saudi Arabia's Diriyah Biennial Foundation and China's UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, with UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art's Director Fei Yu as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennial is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibition items, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, some of which use recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain Series" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Barkley, the CEO of the Diriey Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this biennial exhibition could establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the booming cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia, and strengthen the interactive exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the Biennial is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to be integrated into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Comprehensive Regulation of Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng): In order to continuously help the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to promote rural revitalization and help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
According to the relevant personnel of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the impoverished people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of personnel recruited for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of post development and setting up, the new regulations clearly stipulate that posts should be set up in accordance with the principles of "set up posts on demand, assign personnel to posts, dynamic management, overall control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of public announcement, application, review, public announcement, employment, pre-job training and on-the-job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the development departments of each rural public welfare post to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; It is also required that relevant departments regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts.

Although the Right-wing had its moments of success in history, they were not long-lasting. This is because they flourished with a bit of sunlight and perspired with a sip of boiled water; they could gain Longxi-Shu with a bit of success, but Mao will follow with a strike.
But realistically speaking, right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting administrative systematization, and protecting human rights.
As for me, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his words and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and the social issues in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-communism requires revolution, which inevitably leads to social unrest, hardship of the people, a mix of political groups, and foreign interference.
Fourth, to change or improve China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of the situation through political opportunism are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk more about it.
Left, they are actually a group of abandoned children of the era and politics.
If the Right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the Left has no chance, because what the Left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I saw some friends arguing with traitors and refuting the madman, which was quite impressive. However, I think it is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with either a traitor or a madman; they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think of getting antagonists and leftists to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you a five-cent, and when the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them and become obsessed.
As his dreams drifted further away, the Dragon Slayer eventually became an Evil Dragon.
Left and right I feel generally refers to constraint and freedom, China from the historical and cultural innate genes resulting in China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing in the country emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the competition between China and the US is left-leaning, which is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just like it and it's done.
No more words, Hua Hua is so righteous.
In the past two years, the United States' blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to American-based companies.
The United States has been suppressing the Chinese chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and decreased production capacity of chip manufacturing companies, thus causing a shortage and chaos in the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the chip shortage has affected many industries around the world, such as automakers halting production and phones increasing in price, almost all industries that use chips have been severely affected.
In order to gain control over the "chip" autonomy, more and more tech giants from different countries are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the Chip Summit and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish the Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing domestic technology giants such as Intel, the old American technology giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field. Intel has invested $20 billion to build two wafer fabrication plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is so certain because Intel, as an old-school technology giant of the United States, has been deeply cultivating in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and must be able to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer fabrication plant, Zhang Zhongmou spoke without hesitation: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Chang Chung-Mou was disdainful of Intel's foray into the wafer field because he still remembered the grudges between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the pearl of the manufacturing industry in the United States of America, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful entities.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the Integrated Device Manufacturing (IDM) model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to afford the huge costs of setting up a production line.
In response to market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer fabrication could be established.
Not long after, Tsung-Mou Chang's vision became reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business to the single process of wafer fabrication, providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, TSMC was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Chang Hung-Mao once sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Chang Hung-Mou also determined that Intel at the time was looking down on wafer fabrication services.
Surprisingly, the giant that once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services now has to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel entered semiconductor manufacturing.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally does not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to overtake.
I'm not waiting anymore.

What is normal public opinion?
Selecting three hot topics randomly: February 2nd Dragon Raising, Haoliyu Price Increase, and the Hualala Incident, public opinion spread and formed a peak, then [index decreased] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small hump will appear again.
They look identical to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was once displayed on the Cyberspace Administration of China's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event, presenting an Isolated Peak, Sawtooth, and Cliff.
【Isolated peak】refers to artificial heating, quickly rushing to the hot search list, causing public attention; 【Sawtooth】refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff】refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and is ready to take on new tasks and rush to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event is exactly the valley of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which manipulate decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, almost considering all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black PR will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

DaMei360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No. 156, Huan Cheng Nan Road
At first it was a friend introduction because of trust, so I chose to take a look at my initial budget of 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time and only showed them my floor plan. They didn't measure the house in person, but they were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000. They roughly showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this money can never be refunded unless you have enough experience and fight with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated. In a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 RMB did not include plumbing and electrical renovation, nor any doors, cabinets, or bathroom, which are the major expenses for basic installation.
Besides these, their service fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything first.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced, with a specialized team to deal with me.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem and they are not responsible at all.
There are all kinds of shifting the blame and many details that I don't want to talk about, but in short, don't choose them because my friend's house that they renovated had poor quality and they charged a lot of fees afterwards.
Cheating, they were originally the Leading Decoration deceiving people, now changed to Da Mei, seems to have closed down again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shady decoration company.
In the future, when making choices, everyone should Baidu and consult these matters, because renovation is not a small expense.

Posting of merchant reviews in any form is strictly prohibited. Please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of DaMei360 integrated home decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
It's so scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then. If the refund isn't made within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel since it was less than 15 minutes.

Stargazers, get ready! The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th. - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it late at night on the same day.
Amateur astronomers Anjiu from Beijing captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical popularization, introduced that just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini Meteor Shower usually appears at the end of the year, and its "showing period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the Geminids and Perseids, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move at a slower speed, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, captured the Gemini Meteor Shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13th, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR, the number of meteors visible per hour when the radiant is at the zenith under ideal observing conditions) of 150.
A recommended index chart for the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini Meteor Shower left a deep impression with its "falling stars", but this year's Gemini Meteor Shower will be interfered by the moonlight, so the spectacle will be discounted a bit.
On the 14th, it is November 11th (Lunar Calendar), with a full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with observation, but fortunately the moon will set in the later part of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Gemini Meteor Shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast in the suburbs or rural areas, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it visually.
Note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Photographers who enjoy photography should choose a wide angle and large aperture lens to capture stunning shots of a meteor shower. When shooting, use a high ISO and the largest aperture.
Considering stability and continuity, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter cable are also essential.
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between Laser TV and Traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD television, and the difference in market positioning between laser television and LCD television mainly lies in the following two points:
First, Laser TV focuses more on the Large Screen Market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, Laser TVs obviously focus more on the large screen market, or in other words, Laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of Laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of Laser TVs have been increasing globally, and they account for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to ZhongyiKang's prediction, the sales of laser TVs in 2020 will increase by more than 140%, continuing its high-speed growth.
The reason for its success in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronics Standardization Institute SaiXi Laboratory and Beijing Union Medical College Hospital ophthalmologists obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that Laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
In the current era of increasing emphasis on visual health, Laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Secondly, Laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are Laser TVs so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, Laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short-throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is relatively shorter than traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small and compact host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand Laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
With lower heat output and less equipment loss, the life span of a television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as True 4K Ultra HD picture quality, Artificial Intelligence system, Bionic Screen, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a false demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audiovisual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle short-focus projector-laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflective mirror, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some ambient light, using a microstructured Fiber Optic Screen is expensive, the price of an 80-inch can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
Furthermore, I particularly despise projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection being good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. Don't take it seriously, LCD televisions are also "directly" diffuse. When you turn on the television, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it will not be able to form an image.
The hot spots (light spots) effect of the high-gain screen has been overlooked, when a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes from a certain angle, that's when it really becomes uncomfortable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Premium Quality Store currently has no branches.
After adding WeChat, Miss sent me the available time slots and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
When I arrived, I had a brief conversation with Miss about my ideas. She was very patient and helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, we decided to start the makeup styling. Before the photographer started shooting, he would arrange some props and guide the actions, paying attention to every detail.
But maybe because we didn't communicate the specific photography ideas, the style wasn't what I wanted, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After taking good photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and discuss the post-production style, which feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, just wait for the effect~
I won the all-you-can-eat photography activity for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s. He feels a little bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process is quite pleasant.

Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
I filled out my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then I chose the clothes. I could choose wedding dresses, and they were very patient when I changed three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I spent a long time doing makeup, and the service attitude was also good. Later, during the photoshoot, they taught me how to pose, but the photos came out looking like my face was too big. They said the editing would take half a month, but I received it in three or four days, and it felt like there was no difference from the original.
The overall environment is still good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are approximately three makeup locations, inside of which is a photography studio.
The service is warm and caring.
Stylists are very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the poses seriously.
If unsatisfied, the photographer will also proactively suggest a reshoot.
【Experience】The styling may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made to look like triple eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily life without drawing eyebrows.
The photos have been given for ten days, but the effect of Photoshop is not very satisfactory, and the eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Not sure what style to go for, I tried on two dresses and eventually chose the black dress. The salesperson said this one was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After picking out the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots for editing. The guy said the finished product would be ready within 15 minutes and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
I haven't received a reply for 3 days... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the PRS Organization Plus Monthly Plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay the shipping fee every time now.
Can I waive the monthly fee first until you finish your investigation and then charge me?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the Internet.
According to the conditions set out, according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Agencies (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, initiators have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million yuan to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, they require strength, approval from the state authorities of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), good style of shareholders, and as an insurance broker, Small Umbrella Insurance, the insured does not need to question too much whether Small Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claim and the insurer are both Hetai Life Insurance, Xiaoyusan Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode, the products of Internet platform have lower operating costs and sales staff costs, so the cost-effectiveness of Internet products is generally higher. Moreover, the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, which can reduce the payment pressure of policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the insurance agent, this is particularly important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims and the risk of denial of claims.
I have done insurance phone sales on "Tencent Weibo" (which is the same as Little Umbrella, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but it's people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, free to get 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they won't tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the following months need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers don't know what they bought after deducting the fee for one or two years.
Thinking that you can spend one dollar and the insurance company will pay out 6 million (windfall).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy number segments such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you to redeem it if you don't do it yourself.
(This is another pitfall for the policyholder) Free to get 60,000 critical illness coverage, which is short-term. If relying solely on this without other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 can't do anything to solve the problem, and the future life begins to be naked.
The state is also cracking down on the misdirection of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, the platform is fine, the products are also fine, the problem lies with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the topic starter should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, with more opportunities and products for customers to choose from. Some of their products also have better cost-performance ratios than internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers to purchase offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before underwriting, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During underwriting, I will compare and contrast three companies for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results. After underwriting, I will arrange and custody the policy for customers, so that they can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there is no "ceremony" when purchasing Internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telemarketing" assembly line job, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we buy insurance and consider whether the intermediary we choose is an insurance intermediary person who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us even after many years?
How can I contact the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to give me compensation?

But the rider left it at the doorway, and then the person left.

Just redeem the promo code.
No problem, remember there is no need to arrange for a resend, I have purchased another one, I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to these villains.
If we ignore political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from the Facebook friend requests you sent, to the posts with sarcasm, and then to your attempt to post my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only kept tagging me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to talk about me on Facebook with your so-called friends in an unrestrained manner, some of which were implicit and humiliating. Comments about my appearance, figure, good looks, and whether to plant strawberries in bed or not, I... just forget it.
Later, I received messages from multiple friends about your Facebook friend account with a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment elements.
Sorry, as a female, I can no longer remain silent.
After my report was uploaded to the news, you didn't show any restraint, instead you became even more arrogant.
No matter what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, both sexes should be respected.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of humorous, implicit, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are only caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your plan or continue to make all offensive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I have no ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need you to judge.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you doing?
I said yes, but you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl who has been bullied can still say she is okay.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is free in people's hearts.
I cut some messages for everyone to evaluate.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the post you sent yourself, right?
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and COVID-19 pandemic mitigation and economic recovery and development after the pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Ruan Mengxiong stated that despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of digital technology companies in Vietnam still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10% in 2021.
In 2021, Vietnam has focused on the production of digital products to address the major challenges it faces. Many digital products have gone global, and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take on the responsibility of developing the country's digital transformation platform and to assume the task of developing these national digital platforms is to assume the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technology, shared their mobilization and gathering of social resources to develop Vietnamese technology companies, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, and Huihui Zhu's breakthrough ideas and solutions for economic recovery after the epidemic.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the only way forward for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services all citizens, so it is necessary to mobilize all citizens to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation needs to embody the national spirit, and should be mainly driven by internal forces, such as strategy, long-term and decisive factors, with external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deepened development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help promote green transformation and develop green energy.
Digital transformation should involve the establishment of databases to protect and promote the cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and practices, etc. of the relevant countries, and promote digital transformation in the fields of banking, taxation, land management, development databases and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has called for governments at all levels, institutions and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve systems related to digital transformation, strengthen national governance, and promote the development of digital technology companies in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the 2021 Vietnam Manufacturing Outstanding Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the Vietnam Manufacturing Digital Product Exhibition.

On Double Twelve, go to the Hanson water purifier store to check out the water purifiers. There is an ongoing activity in the store with more favorable prices.
Juran Home has a total of 11 floors, from Basement 2 to 9th floor. Basement 1 and Basement 2 are both parking places and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not great, there are few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the restaurants is just average.
This elevator is also very speechless, just like having a serious illness, going back and forth between the negative two and negative one floors, no matter how many times I press this floor, it can't go down to the first floor from the safety passage, it's also very speechless, it directly leads to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and the safety passage can't get out!
Juran Home still needs to be improved, there are many places that have not been developed.
The address is 555 Güney Yolu Caddesi, Şehitkamil District, with convenient transportation and a large parking lot, which is free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is huge, with 8-9 floors, and you can buy furniture, home appliances, and all kinds of small things...

The Yangtze River mainstream achieves full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Water-Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Fuling, Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second Water-Green Comprehensive Service Zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the one in Luzhou, Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8th.
Thus, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the Upper, Middle, and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Zone is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, significantly improving the ability to receive ship pollutants and shipping services.
According to the introduction, the Maritime Green Comprehensive Service Zone is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for ships and sailors, helping them to solve the "urgent distress" problem.
Two Aquatic Green Comprehensive Service Zones have been built and put into operation in the Upper Yangtze River. They integrate life services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. The realization of "one-time mooring and multiple services" in the port will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and the most powerful weapon in the US Navy armory is making a rare visit to Guam. According to a report from the pro-China media outlet Duowei, this sends an important signal to both the US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, on January 9th, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Babuyan Channel.
The Babar Strait, connecting the South Sea and the Suru Sea, is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the West Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy the Carl Vinson to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier onboard transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy is currently sailing in the Pacific with the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Abraham Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region also has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the USS Shoup missile cruiser and the USS Stockdale missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US three aircraft carriers gather around China, the strongest weapon rarely visits Guam. On January 17, 2022, the US Navy carrier-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B flew the route.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence.
The Ohio-class submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, arrived at the Guam Naval Base last Saturday (January 15th).
US three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon rarely visits Guam. Analysts say this is a signal sent to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
US Three Carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon rarely visits Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Spratly Islands of China.
(South China Sea Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rampage Submarines" in the US Navy Fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the Leighing Submarine the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad, which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located on the US mainland, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop of META and the evaporation of 251 billion US dollars in market value, Zuckerberg responded that they are facing unprecedented competition. What is the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest Ad Network, many Apps are connected to Meta's Ads, and it is through Meta's Ad Platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustment of its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that do overseas business.
Meta has about hundreds of offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in Mainland China.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets cannot go around Meta as an advertising channel, with most of the money spent going to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta in the Greater China Region is also very good.
I haven't specifically researched it recently, but it definitely won't be better than previously.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels was not successful.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets not only focus on revenue, but more importantly on future expectations.
Clearly, the expectations of Meta are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the Metaverse.
Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the implementation period of Metaverse is relatively long, so this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite the current success of Facebook, with annual revenues of $10-20 billion, it is in a state of crisis compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, with no real safe haven.
Although his several social software now have a higher daily activity and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., he has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Given the unattainable concept of a global universe, there is no hope of success in the short term, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new tracks. But I think his track selection is wrong and it is a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
