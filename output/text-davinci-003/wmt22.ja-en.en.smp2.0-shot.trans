When I tried to buy an entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than twice as much for the orange one.
What's different?
I couldn't figure it out by looking it up, so please tell me.
There should only be blue now.
If there is one, it might just be the old product left over.

Since there's stuff like that, I don't really feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when people were saying it wasn't particularly funny.
Clearly, it's not funny, but it's creepy that people say "you have to laugh at everything the popular comedian says" as if it's a given.
But if the staff don't laugh, it'll ruin the comedian's mood, and it'll be unpleasant to work with them, right?
It's like a black company from the past in that industry, and it's like a physical education club, and some of the entertainers' egos are too big and they seem to be taking a normal unpleasant attitude, so they have to do it if they want to survive.
On the other hand, there are many comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work by saying "Don't belittle comedians" one after another.
I know that the income is quite low until it becomes popular, but I'm not going to be told every time like I'm standing at the top of the difficult job category of entertainer.
It sounds like a justification for the too high position of comedians in the media and society for the beautification of their own career.
To be honest, there are quite tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel that things related to the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like if I didn't let it out, like a fart, it wouldn't be good for my body...

Ikemoto Printing Press Industries Mail Order
Get the hairbrush ready!
A sample will be given to the purchaser.
The item I ordered from Tsutaya Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I had to return it.
Rather than talking about self-made PCs, it's a mail-order trouble, but no matter how I think about it, I can't accept it, so I'll let you write it here since it's a famous place.
It all started when I discovered that the MSI Wireless Gaming Mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop Tsukumo Day Sale, which started from last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the page for the wired version to consider the possibility of a price mistake, and it was 5,071 yen (Link FISH Taku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order confirmation email arrived normally, and the shipping confirmation email arrived the next day.
In both of these emails and in my page's purchase history, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the order to the shipment, since there was no contact or cancellation notification of a mistake, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
Here is the problem, a few hours after shipping, an email came saying "there was a mistake in the product registration".
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
1. Reject the receipt and cancel everything
2. Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose your response.
The wired version and the wireless version have separate product pages, and although the purchase history, email, and delivery note all say wireless version, it seems they sent the wired version without permission.
Isn't it terrible that they sent a different product than what was purchased without any understanding and if we want a refund we have to send it back from our side?
In the end, I want to retaliate with something like accepting a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.

Even with parents and siblings, there can be various personalities and unreasonable people, so relationships can be bad.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the typhoon and heavy rain was washed away. Residents tripled their reserves of food supplies <Yamaki Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara District in Yamatsuri, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a big impact on the lives of 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was broken so quickly, like it was being washed away," the only road connecting the Takachi Plain District, "Takachi Plain Bridge," was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, and 30 households of 11 residents were isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not allowed, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Kōro Matsumoto: "Normally I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car and had to carry it or carry it across the iron bridge and walk here, I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was set up.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"At least, I think we should secure about two to three days' worth of food," We have stocked about three times more food than before the disaster that can be used for emergency rations such as canned food and cup noodles.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, but since you don't know when a disaster will come to you, I felt again that it would be better for everyone to prepare a little bit." On the other hand, Yagi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" of a bridge being washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Yagi Town Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryuichi: "We have determined it as 'Yagi Town Disaster Prevention Day' and we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards. We have also announced it."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympics.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of sightseeing in Tokyo through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and people who visited the venue put on special equipment and ran through the marathon course of the Paralympics reproduced in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, an avatar of oneself appears and one can experience a competition like running a marathon course together with participants from inside and outside the country. Furthermore, one can enjoy sightseeing spots in the metropolitan area.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough while running, but it's amazing to be able to run while having fun, and I'm glad I was able to keep going until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure people can enjoy it at sports gyms and other places, too," and they plan to set it up after the new year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system is doing well in used housing transactions.
Both the price of detached houses and condominiums have risen, and the renovation market is also expanding.
With the increase in the preference for living in one's own home due to the corona disaster, there is a concentration of popularity on properties represented by words such as "in front of the station", "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale", and "tower", and this may also be affected by the sharp decrease in the relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
See the image of this article. However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan still remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a survey called "inspection", which was aimed at trading in safe and secure used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate Trading Business Act (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including the deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the purchase and sale transaction, which can give the buyer a sense of security.
It also contributes to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that can understand the condition of the used house to be purchased and can purchase with satisfaction, and it is said to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for building condition surveys is mainly the seller.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system was mandatory.
In other words, the real estate business in charge of the mediation has the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, looking abroad, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
Before the sale of a house, the buyer requests a building inspection from an expert called an inspector or building surveyor under the system.
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, 70-90% of the transactions for existing homes are inspected.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead to conduct inspections, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the seller-oriented one.
The seller's side will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, to sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are looking to inspect the survey content and make appropriate repairs so they can live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the two parties' objectives and intentions.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection of the seller-led type inspection prescribed by the country shall be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking important defects ● For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can also be called a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller will be conducted.

It was quite difficult.
However, I had mentally recovered, so I was full of motivation.
Because I was a researcher and my body wasn't keeping up, I would sometimes fall asleep during work.
Since it was the second time in a year, I thought of taking a break for a month and parting ways with the crappy company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it dragged on for a long time.
Anyway, it is important to go to a psychiatric hospital and get the proper treatment, as well as to keep a record of your visits.
If you have a history of hospital visits, even if you resign for personal reasons, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the judgment of a doctor at the Hello Work, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance etc. will be drastically lowered.
Even if it's hard to find a job, or if you want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

Five trivia topics you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula back in the day.
As evidence of that ... ..., it's only in Ginza that you can show off a bit of trivia.
Let me introduce you to some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to tell someone after you learn it.
Go up Ginza! ?
First dive into the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines scattered around the area.
We were walking around Ginza and suddenly the silence was broken with "This used to be a peninsula back in the day."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The Ginza, the epitome of a bustling city that has created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint for silver coins, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawachō," but when it moved to Ginza it became known by its nickname, "Ginza."
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
From before the Edo period, the Inari River flowed into the Marunouchi area from Hibiya, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and promoted boat transportation by digging canals.
And they cut away the earth of the moat and cut down the Kanda mountain, and filled in the inlet.
Why not try looking for the stone monument of "Ginza's Place of Origin" that indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Tiffany & Co. Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) if you are interested?
A pilgrimage to the Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibei Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after the performance.
On the other hand, the "Ryukou Fudou Son" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and the "Ginza Deseche Jizō Son" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi Ginza Terrace.
The "Hōtō Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwai Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwai Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The "Seikō Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" where the fox welcomes you is built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, so that there will be the benefit of "abundant crops" where the rice is well harvested.
This eventually led to the benefit of business prosperity being said to be in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, Japan's most prosperous city, faith spread.
What do you think of the people who returned home without getting vaccinated?

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if I had hypersensitivity.
The nerve has been cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to make the pain go away quickly.
Before the treatment, when I touch my tooth, I have a sharp pain, will it get better in a few days?
The painkiller doesn't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.
Take care.

Let's write about something good that recently happened.
Because of the coronavirus, it became fun to stay at home and drink a lot of alcohol without meeting anyone.

Recruiting - How to Compile Scripts & How to Modify Existing Scripts
I looked around quite a bit and tried my best, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I wanted to start from MO2 so I tried an app for that, but I don't know how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorial, but there's only information on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...

During the Greater East Asia War, were most of the military personnel government officials?
Almost all of them are not, but all of them are now called civil servants.
Since the military itself is an organization of the state, those who are said to have been drafted by conscription are considered to be civil servants of the state in terms of organization.

A male body was discovered in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shounai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Sho-nakagawa River in Nakashidami, Moriyama Ward and reported it to 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he had died at the scene.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity and investigate the cause of death.
On the other hand, a 70-year-old man was found lying in the river in Okazaki-shi, Fukuoka-cho, and his death was confirmed.
Although there was no disorder in the men's clothing, it is said that there was a bicycle fallen nearby.
The police are quickly confirming the identity while investigating the situation at the time.
Regarding the payment of the non-taxable household grant in the middle of February, if there is one non-taxable person in the household, will it be paid?

Korea Post International has acquired Senex Energy of Australia, expanding its overseas gas field business = Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, POSCO International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the procedures such as the approval of the resolution at the general meeting of shareholders of Sennex Energy and the approval of the local corporation remaining, the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, and it was decided that Posco International would invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has continued to increase even in the era of energy conversion, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the market with green hydrogen, which led to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Originally, February 11th was the only national foundation day, but now it has become a holiday because the current emperor was born on February 23rd.

Could the pain in your knee be "osteoarthritis" ?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been having continuous knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, joint rheumatism, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial Department: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to soften the impact and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage may become worn down or distorted.
As a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in joints other than the knee?
Yes, Mr. Maruyama.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the foot, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial Department: So, what kind of structure is a joint made of?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where these two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the joint is surrounded by "joint capsule".
Editorial department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Within the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane which produces the joint fluid.
This synovial fluid plays the role of a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the movement of the knee smoother, which is why it is said.
Editorial Department: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role so that bones do not directly collide with each other.
It's like a cushion role, isn't it?
However, if this wears away or becomes distorted, it can deform the joint or cause inflammation, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basically pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the laundry, I wear something like a tracksuit to sleep!
Even for heavy smokers, are there people who can quit smoking and people who can't quit?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he just kind of felt like giving it up, so he ended up doing it.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Experience for Real (with Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Gambling Manga Series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where lives are at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my feet tingle... ... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I want to verify the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a planning video.
■Swamp The pachinko machine "Swamp" featured in the gambling abstinence record Kaiji is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaizi was shocked by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This swamp had large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-Step Cruun" set up, and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl aquarium on the building to cause the foundation to sink and tilt, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The "Iron Cross Crossing" that was implemented on debtors including Kaiji at the "Star Side Party" hosted as a pastime by the rich was a "Human Horse Race" Iron Cross Crossing.
The debtor advances carefully so as not to fall from the thin iron frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win a prize, but there are only four iron beams and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this iron girder crossing is highly dangerous, in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is possible to experience a very similar experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home base of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
This Eagle Bridge is a one-piece steel bridge extending to a point 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and "Sky Bungee" and "Victory Bridge" are provided ahead of it, and you can walk to it.
Of course, safety measures have been taken.
Comedian Corera Kōarashi released a video of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge on his own YouTube channel, saying "You can experience the iron girder crossing in Japan", and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Divide into Emperor's side and Slave's side and play with a total of 10 cards, 1 Emperor's card and 8 Citizen's cards and 1 Slave's card.
This game is very well made, with the Emperor being strong to the citizens, the citizens being strong to the slaves, and the slaves being strong to the Emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ear cut off.
After a hard fight, Kaiji realized that his ears, like the attached earphones, were being read by a device that sensed and transmitted changes in pulse and body temperature, so he shaved his ears to the extreme and made his body abnormal to confuse Rinkai and won.
The E-Card is commercially available and can be purchased through Amazon and other outlets.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video in which he plays a game of E-card with actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, and it caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaiji mood?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step into the New Year, gently pushing forward - an Inu (dog) Dai-ema at the Prefectural Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
At the prefectural shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, the large votive horse of the zodiac animal of the next year, "Tora (Tiger)" has appeared.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design who designed it visited the shrine, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University for the original drawings of the ema since the year before last.
This time, out of the works drawn by nine people in the Japanese painting course of the Fine Arts Department, which is led by Professor Suehara Toshimitsu, the work of 22-year-old Tsuchiya Yui was adopted.
The O-ema is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya-san said he painted an image of the cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping in his tracks, the tiger gazing at the cherry blossom held a wish that he could have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world.
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the ema generally distributed.
Gonnegi Kenichi (44) from Chiba said, "I think I can be of help to everyone in overcoming their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano, where I want to continue living" - Proposals from the City 4 High School Workshop: San Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together in a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the raw voices of young people are collected and proposed to the mayor.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison, such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and people from the local area discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" while moving around an island with each person assigned a theme in a World Cafe approach.
Write each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting that there are many young people in this town." "Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
Are there any common points? Let's discuss further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the sea is attractive," said 18-year-old Tamano Commercial High School student.
The 18-year-old students from Binan High School talked with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have a lot of nature," and they seemed to have noticed not only the issues of the region but also its appeal.
The second meeting in December will be attended only by high school students to organize the proposals.
We plan to announce it next February, inviting the mayor and the superintendent of education.
The president of the same center said, "In addition to fostering a sense of attachment to the local area among high school students, it can be a trigger for young people to take the initiative in town development."
In Kanto, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake with a seismic intensity of 4 originated in the southern part of Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News
At around 12:31 PM on the 12th, an earthquake of magnitude 4 occurred in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures.
According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture and the depth of the epicenter was about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be M 5.0.
There is no worry about the tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake is as follows in each area.
Shindo 4 = Kuki, Kasama Ishii (Ibaraki), Azusa Taisho (Tochigi), Kiryu Motosuku (Gunma), Ota Nishi Honmachi (Saitama) Iwatsuki-ku, Kazusa (Saitama) etc. ▽ Shindo 3 = Mito (Ibaraki), Utsunomiya (Tochigi), Maebashi Horikoshi (Gunma), Kawagoe Shinjuku (Saitama), Chiba Hanamigawa (Chiba), Otemachi (Tokyo), Tsurumi Suehiro (Kanagawa) etc. ▽ Shindo 2 = Koriyama Konan (Fukushima), Hitachi (Ibaraki), Kanuma (Tochigi), Takasaki (Gunma) etc.

How to Find - New Way to Wind a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is indispensable in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding it up, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the knack.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be quickly wrapped around, but then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves has a long side of approximately one meter, giving it a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if weaving a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is in a net-like pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edge of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, you can wind it up and secure it without connecting the ends.
It's very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
Get Buck is the one directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like the Beatles in their rawest form, it's all fresh and new...
We're on the verge of disbanding, so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While taking charge, he said something like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" With Paul, who was a pain, and George, who was hesitating and saying "But, you know...", and John, who was not very motivated and was always late despite talking about opinions and jokes... and even Ringo, who was the peacemaker, didn't really take the initiative and just sat there with a "Oh, this is troublesome" face.
We didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very familiar feeling of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had that same feeling. What would you call it, a legendary dismantling?
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase and gradually building up to "that famous song" while saying "How about this one?" to each other is crazy.
Especially the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
A subtle hum-hum-hum like a nose song gradually became a zucha♪zucha♪ and the scene where the lyrics enter was firmly recorded and amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, it doesn't happen often.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is so full of energy that just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three has been released so far, but my impression is that the biggest cause of the Beatles' dissolution was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
Although the four of them complained about this and that, they seemed to have fun when they started making music, but when it came to finding a place to play live, people like producers and promoters started talking in a "Beatles are the best in the world!" kind of way, and it was easy to see that they had taken the reins away from the four of them.
Well, since documentaries involve the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought it might be because Paul is supervising, so there are a lot of scenes where Paul looks like a villain.

How strong is Berserk's Guts compared to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't do it.
Do not call out the technique name before executing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you have been feeling a sense of responsibility and gradually losing your peace of mind.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities myself, but I felt that I was very suited to sales activities that were requested by customers, so I switched to a different industry and found it much easier to work.
Even though I was asked about what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do in my heart, my life will become a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest so that you can have room in your heart to consider this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there is a union of the company, an industrial doctor, or a window where you can consult, it might be good to consult there because there may be some system.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have occurred frequently in the United States, causing major damage due to unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time, to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
It is believed that due to the strong cold air coming down from the record-breaking warmth for this time of year, the atmosphere became very unstable and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest to the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen to near 30°C on Thursday and Friday local time.
Due to the strong cold air below -30°C near 5500m in the sky, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued on a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday alone, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and one on the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength (the Fujita scale, revised) on the 6-point scale, with a gust of wind of around 70 m/s, has occurred.
There is a possibility that it will be classified as EF4-5 according to future surveys.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, to match the condition of Japanese buildings.
The JEF3 equivalent to the recent tornadoes in the US has a high possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses can collapse.

Live broadcast from under the "greatest in history" rice roll seeking help (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, on the 11th (Japan time 12th), President Biden expressed his view with a solemn expression that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
Reported by US CNN TV, etc.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can".
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
In Kentucky, which was affected by the tornado, residents carry household goods and furniture from damaged houses. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As for the range of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (approximately 350 kilometers) that caused damage to Missouri and other states in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the largest scale of approximately 250 miles (approximately 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Meadowfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that was operating 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas campaign also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
Under a thick pile of rubble about 1.5 meters deep in the darkness, a woman who was unable to move felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above the rubble and asked for help through a live broadcast on Facebook from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the broadcasted live stream, the sound of "Happy Birthday to You" sung while crying was also heard, as if to mask the fear of another woman.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, was safe as she and her 5-year-old son hid in the basement of their home when a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumble from the ground," he looked back and said.
The police officers of the Mayfield City Police will continue the search until it is no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue operations without knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, part of a warehouse belonging to the major online retailer Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of being detached from the carriages, and the highway has been closed one after another due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to increase it?
Take high-protein foods and drinks.
Avoid coarsely cut raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be nice if there were "live-in work opportunities" such as inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and an income source, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.
I just Googled and it looks like there's a site like this ↓,
Live-in Part-time Job / Full-time Employee Job - Live-in Recruitment Navi (Sumina-bai)
There are "bargain, live-in, job" in the related search, so it seems that many of my colleagues are of that kind.
For bank accounts and line contracts, it seems that it can be done somehow if there is an address only for the first time, but for credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't renew it without an address (because a new card is sent to the registered address).
What does it mean to be a specialist doctor in gynecology?
A "senior specialist" is a doctor in the 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Late-term Training Doctor".
The so-called "resident" refers to a "first-year resident," referring to a doctor in the first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, when I reach 4-5 years of experience I will be able to do certain medical treatments, so I will be entrusted with various tasks.

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries use a five-star system to deduct points from, Japan's argument is that three stars should be neutral and points should be added or deducted from there.
At the baseline point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings of "there are elements of deduction" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we set five stars as the standard, then "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest level in all respects" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since it is actually operated in such a system, I understand why you would like to not give three stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, when trying to refute the arguments of those who advocate this view with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation does not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fits a standard hose size?
The power capacity that can be taken from the USB is approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump varies depending on the product, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.

The Making of a Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the one I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right..
So here's the main point, I was supposed to make an AM radio but it sounds like an FM radio.
Why do you think so? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the Esp of SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a loose file in an appropriate location, then it does not need ESP.
I remember seeing something about that somewhere, but I can't remember where...
I understand the risks, so I don't plan on actually doing it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If there is anyone who remembers, could you please tell me if it's okay to do?
Thank you for your contribution.

<Saga Eating Record> "Hakobune" "Freshly caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box "Freshly caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce."
"Hakobune," a takeout specialty store with a colorful and abundant bento and deli (souzai) using plenty of vegetables.
"We want people to be able to experience the feeling of a restaurant even at home," said Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple, who opened it in August last year.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fried with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available at the market at that time.
According to Mr. Kiyoshi, the batter for fried food is made as thin as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be directly perceived. Therefore, the texture of shrimp fried food is crispy and can be directly perceived.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, portioned rice with mixed grains from Saga Prefecture's Hinohikari rice, and soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the self-grown field next to the house or from the direct sales office in the prefecture.
The side dish changes depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyo has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a mix of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as the "comforting taste of rolled eggs" (Yumi-san).
The bento "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to pass by Haneda Airport and saw something interesting, so I decided to give it a try.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's safe because the speed was reduced or even completely stopped when there were people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze of those around me hurts; it's good to be seen, but it feels like they're looking at me like I'm a nuisance, and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if there were some consideration, such as asking them to move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
I thought it was a great vehicle because I could relax and take in the scenery while taking it slow, although it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a difficult ride, with a sense of anticipation and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the surrounding gaze due to the near-future feeling of whether such automated driving will become mainstream in the future. It is difficult for those who are not holders of a strong-willed heart.
It was so embarrassing.

If you look closely, you might understand a bit, but this is a bowl of rice with nothing but rice in it.
The answer is "!Eggplant!" (Tap to see the correct answer)
I like eel, but when I thought that everyone is just eating it with sauce and the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly... I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I don't want the eel to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat it.
Recipe Used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (Sprinkled with yam pepper instead of scallions.)
I just fried the steamed one in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.
I am 20 years old.

I'm mentally ill to the point of being dangerous.
The work isn't going well.
Around October, I was considering taking a break, and I was stretching out my sense of responsibility halfway, and it finally reached its limit.
I'm quitting my job and I'm thinking of giving up IT.
But I don't know how to live from now on.
I had worked at a supermarket part-time, but I couldn't even do that kind of job (so I was doing engineering part-time).
Are there any people in LLLer who have experience with illness, suspension, or retirement?

One man was cut off and escaped on a motorcycle on the 12th in Saga City Otsu, a attempted murder case | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, on the street in Daizai 1-chōme, Saga City, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s, and suffered facial injuries.
The man escaped by bike and Saga South Police Station is pursuing him as an attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "there is a fight".
The man sustained an approximately 10 cm long and 1 cm deep wound on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated if there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities on the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong Business Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the number of mammal species being the highest in the world and the number of plant species being the third highest in the world.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection activities by local governments but also activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan Province, located in southwest China, is also one of these regions.
Ms. Li Wenda, my younger sister, is currently active as an actress. Si Sa Pan Na is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and it is an area where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group who share the same roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The autonomous state of Xishuangbanna Dai (Xishuangbanna Dai) occupies only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Ms. Li Minhua in person at Sichuan-Tibet Plateau and heard about her environmental protection activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Ms. Li, we started our environmental protection activities "Tianni" in 2000.
The catalyst for that was my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seychelles for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts a number of biological diversities.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to root industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforest was carried out before.
He was dispatched here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And here I got to know someone and got married while I was a journalist.
Before that, did Mr. Li not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li, I am from Cesar Panna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I had to push forward the project with my husband.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face and aren't especially tall, I sometimes see people with an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out when you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of confidence within themselves.

I suddenly thought, is it too detailed to compliment someone's outfit or say something like "the colors look nice"?
It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's detailed.
I haven't been told to praise in detail, so I'm not sure what it means.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yokomine Sakura?
I replied, "My heart is blooming with joy after your confession, so I'd be happy to go out with you," and we started dating.
And, in order to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
If I choose not to open a NISA account when opening a Rakuten Securities account, can I open one at a later time?

Furthermore, since there are no fees, we recommend opening a NISA account so that you can use it whenever you want.

【Omakan / Personal Notes】It took about one and a half months to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
In the period from March to GW, due to lack of time to play, multiple CTDs caused by multiple factors occurred, and it took a long time to identify them, mainly during holidays and little by little.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (it would have been clear in a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
The main timing of the CTD
Leave no trace in the log for all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins that log.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activation with "console kill" → Improvement with "Essentials be Gone" (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF * Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
For some NPCs, camera work for activating kill moves is set to OFF via .ini, which is a basic improvement: Is there a conflict in the settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoors) During field movement + partial magic (e.g. freezing rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could it be caused by additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although there are formatting mistakes in the 2.0 SPID default.ini, it should still result in the intended outcome and the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
Initially, we focused heavily on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MOD (.dll) and ended up with this kind of result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there were anyone in a Japanese language environment with a similar CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it as a memo.
Everyone is doing it with a barely mental state.
No one around notices it, not even colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person looks really hard, but they're working so energetically!"
He is probably on the brink of mental exhaustion as well.
I haven't retired in name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before retiring.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits-Now that today's visit is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have built a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply moved by today's home visit nursing about how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and we even had a bit of a laugh about it.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desires, or why she got divorced, and things like that - is it okay to do that in home visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
I have heard from a friend that in the case of a visiting nursing station operated by a psychiatric hospital, an elderly nurse who could no longer work in the ward would come and only provide administrative support, or a visiting nurse with a work therapy specialist would be given instructions from above with a condescending attitude, such as "This is a medical facility".
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses are really good because they face me on an equal footing and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits, and there may also be people who are considering receiving them.
Home visits by nurses can be very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor approves, please take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to terminate contracts because the terms just didn't agree with me.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but when it came out in English, I was scared.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.
Language determination malfunction

But I can't concentrate on work at home.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One Fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced its hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The content was to spread 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, according to the November standards, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 places) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilo is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's performance of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap has fallen far short of its target.
The Japan Association of National Economy (Zenkeiren) announced its report "Current Status and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on the 12th.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents (2014-2020 cumulative), South Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are lower-ranking among competing countries."
The country-specific patent ranking is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, the gap has been widening.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974 cases) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of China (4721 cases).
The Zenkeiren proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large investment and research and development tax deduction."
It has been a month and a half since the surgery was done by cutting the tendon of the finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is slightly swollen and it hurts when I move my hand in the affected area.
Will this heal naturally?
It will heal naturally, but it will take some time.
Even if it hurts, if you don't do rehabilitation, you won't be able to move, so let's do rehabilitation, okay?

I think it's going to be tough if you don't have an address other than paying by the day.
And I feel like daily payments would be difficult without a contact (phone number).
Furthermore, an address is required for the line contract.
So don't forget to keep your smartphone line contract...
For the time being, even if we manage to get by with a comic cafe and day labor
Make sure to not forget as securing an address is the top priority.
It is important to sleep on a futon, and simply to open a bank account or use a debit card, or to receive government services, an address is necessary.
Although living protection should be able to be done without an address, it should be a rare case.

Was the number of female wives from the Meiji period to the Showa period comparatively small compared to now?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so common that the phrase "sister-in-law wife" is said in the streets.
And, it seems that in those days, because it was said "even if you wear a golden headscarf, look for [a wife]", there were more older wives than in the Meiji and Showa periods.

Is it a crime to sell items for more than the regular price at a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at the store for 70,000.
It is legal.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for the price to go up.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the list price.

US aid weapons and ammunition arrived in Ukraine, also involved in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) US State Department officials reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition, based on the security assistance plan approved by President Biden, had arrived in Ukraine by 12th.
The military assistance is equivalent to a total of 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of howitzers will be transported to Ukraine after the New Year.
According to Kirby, the US Department of Defense spokesman, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the increase in forces carried out by the Russian military around the Ukraine border.
The US is strengthening its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, and is also discussing with the NATO member countries and drawing up measures to respond in case Russia decides to launch an attack on Ukraine.
President Biden approved the provision of arms assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House in September this year.
US military support to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, we dispatched state troops from the US state of Florida in accordance with a multilateral joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a confidential matter for the execution of operations.
President Biden had an online meeting with President Putin of Russia on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions in case of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hand" of lifetime gift, directly attacking former Tax Commission Chairman Masaru Amari of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of the Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is "Lifetime Gift and Last-Minute Inheritance Technique".
While the discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the fiscal year 2022, which was a concern, but there is a great possibility that pre-death gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become "forbidden hands" in the near future.
How will the rules of succession change?
Along with a direct hit to the former Tax Commission Chairman and Member of the House of Representatives, Kanemaru, we will impart everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques in order to make it in time for the end of the year with a beneficial rush gift.
(Diamond Editing Department, Kei Miyahara)
From wealthy people to urban company employees, "forbidden hands" are used for pre-death gifts, and "from the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer".
The announcement of the 2021 Tax System Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because what it is trying to say is that it will increase the inheritance tax by prohibiting the "gift before death", which is the orthodox inheritance tax measure, and changing the rules of inheritance.
The iron rule for tax reduction measures for the inheritance tax with a high degree of progressivity is "to reduce the assets subject to taxation".
The pre-mortem gift, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax generated in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although it was omitted from the Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, the policy towards integration was re-established with more detailed wording such as "review the current inheritance taxation system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures for gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed."
Former LDP Tax System Research Committee Chairman and former Secretary General, Aoki, said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to avoid the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of asset transfer and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration (of the two companies). The fastest amendment will leave three chances of pre-death gift giving.
Even without that, it seems likely that in the near future, a large step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax saving measure.
So, how will the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】Kanade Yamaya plays the heroine in this adaptation of the same-named manga by Morie Satoshi, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018. It's a heartbreaking pure love story of a man and a woman carrying the burden of the past.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Rise, is played by Yamayagi Kanjū.
Riso, a college student, meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kairi, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder for some reason.
Rise is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from their parents due to their divorce, but is Kairi a murderer due to certain circumstances?
Yudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
For those who were unable to watch FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already watched it, I believe that you can get to know this work more deeply by looking at the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Riseto, and the changes of the two as they struggle.
I am happy if original fans can also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

After the team won the NFL game with three passes, what were the players feeling and how? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had exceeded 2000 yards for the first time in history in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the run of both LeSean McCoy and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The main reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border and has the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18m, and it was snowing before the game.
Since the Bulls were from the local area, they didn't change their play selection much.
Pass 30 times versus Run 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not bad.
There were four red zone entries in the ten offensive series and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to get three points in one FG in three times.
Last minute defense in front of the goal in the game.
The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd & 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He then threw a pass targeting TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stephen Digs was running a slant-across and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left sideline to the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant and ended in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Call Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen overlooked two receivers and threw a pass aiming for the end zone twice.
The 4th down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on the 3rd down.
You need to get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if he had gone for 4th and short, Allen's own running ability should have come alive.

It's about time for the "throw away time" and "replacement time" - here are three items that tend to stay in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's Bazaar) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often it is changed, it is probably not changed as often as recommended, which is probably the case for sponges.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (although it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend changing the sponge once a week to maintain cleanliness.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when the cutting board starts to become worn and grooves form, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria proliferate.
If it is still okay, do not forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or lightly pat with a clean paper towel to cut off the water and dry.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cutting lips or spilling drinks in the missing parts.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged Righteous General Guan Yu, Submitter: Builder Yu Jin
Submerged hero Guan Yu: "Oi, Yu Jin!"
No smoking.
"Even if 30,000 arrows were to come raining down, Yuki wouldn't die."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get swallowed up by the muddy waters of the river, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"So can we hold the underwater bridge for three quarters of an hour?"
"Ussu Ussu"
"So, make sure you practice so you can endure until the next battle at Fancheng!"
"Ussu!"
Is it a promise?
"I understand!"
"Someday you'll be killed by Cao Cao and I won't even know!"
Saying that, the righteous general went home.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water-attack water-bridge three-quarters practice! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and lock them in a cage and sink them.
Did you read the article at the link even though you quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community market and trade are two different things.
At the Community Market, we use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been victims of fraud where they are left with only the item and no money paid.
That won't happen
Trade is a feature that allows items to be exchanged or given as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different story?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even for simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even for intellectual labor.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I swapped out the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen became black with a white cursor-like dot that didn't blink and stayed there.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end in an hour.
Possible causes are an old USB memory stick or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you overslept and gotten a cold?
Are there any other causes that are similar to that?
Do you dislike men with a poker face all the time?
Oh! I saw an acquaintance.
He always had a Bagabond-like face.
I wasn't particularly disliked.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
I can carry items that are not conspicuous, but I cannot carry things like Louis Vuitton with monograms and written with Lv.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one you're talking to in a rude way?"
If they say it doesn't matter because they are a foreigner, it's best to simply say it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I would have even dreamed of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly decent probability.
I was living overseas halfway, but the Japanese people who went out, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette from the top and bottom, and there were quite a few people who came there, and the tag was off, so I misunderstood that I could say anything to the locals.
If it looks like Westerners, I think they do it without any malice, as if it were some kind of indulgence or friendly feeling.
Even though my friend is from Europe or America, I usually call them by their first name, but when I speak in Japanese, I sometimes get a little confused about which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's a friend.
It's probably just ordinary and pure at first, but if you overlook it, it might not be effective to treat it as an exceptional case of being a layman, so it's better to say it now.
Can you talk to me according to the rules of Japan because it's Japan?
Study: My white friend who naturalized has a habit of raising his glass higher than the others at drinking parties, even though it's not related.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but if I do it that way, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
Regardless of personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details, so it's annoying.

Thank you for 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created sub had exceeded 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday the number of subscribers was 25 people, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50 people, but for some reason today 25 people subscribed, so I am really grateful.
If the person who subscribed to this sub-reddit today could tell us in the comments where they found out about it, that would be greatly appreciated! (I have no idea so I'm very curious)
Currently, there is only one person creating threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in the writing, but I understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be a problem to play (I'm only feeling this way, so it's best to ask other people as well).
You often see translations of this level in games made overseas, and if it's a small company, it feels like it's well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it may take a long time of studying to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

What would you like to do first if you come to Kirishima Onsen?
After entering the hot spring, eat sashimi while drinking beer, then drink local sake while eating local cuisine.
The consideration is that training is the battle in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba".
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a Human Hymn <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemorative Start> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unusual among recent shonen manga is the fact that there is an excessive amount of training.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles day and night, is not popular among readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that only the touch was drawn and the rest was skipped over dramatically, that there was a two-year training when the Straw Hat Pirates separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE".
Well, one-piece is one of the attractions of wandering land, but "staying in the same place and training" may not be compatible.
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began with him kneeling to Tengen Ushiwaka, who had saved his life, and begging for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, to which Ushiwaka said, "Do not let others hold the power of life and death!"
The weak have no rights or choices, only to be forced down by the powerful with all their might... ...
While saying that, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness (though he was also a poor communicator who didn't explain his intention) to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps.
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro, "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" Tanjiro was at a loss for an answer and Rengoku quickly judged him with one phrase, "You're too slow to decide."
Among the fans, it is an unreasonable exchange that looks like a gossip at first glance.
However, walking around with a sister who has become a demon carries the potential that a moment may come when such a judgment is forced upon them.
It can be said that initiation is the preparation of the mind before entering into practice.
Rin Takadzukuri tells Tanjiro to take him to Mt. Haguro, even though he is an unskilled novice, and to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is filled with air pockets, pits, catapults, and traps, making it seem like death before you even start your training.
Nevertheless, with his sharp sense of smell, he can detect the faint smell of a trap set by a human and barely manages to avoid it, which is called the "Protagonist Correction".
Nevertheless, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba that makes Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become physically stronger enough to avoid all of that!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become stronger without any proof, and awakening is only being able to use the power and skills that have been honed up to that point with their original potential.
"The equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who put in effort and gives nothing to those who don't, is a human anthem that differs from the supernatural power of a monster with no basis, and is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping on the floor directly with a mattress, futon, and quilt, instead of a bed.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will it be difficult?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle between different stores?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "strict".
I think of it as "gumption" to devise a plan to get more benefit than effort with the least effort.

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Department" integrating home appliances and mobile phones, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into the Set Division, the name was decided to be DX (Device eXperience) and it was announced on the 12th that this would be reflected in the year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX Department is composed of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network, which were integrated from the CE and IM divisions.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change this time reflects the medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, it was also emphasized that the products, such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect the needs of customers, should enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience with ease.
The strategy of creating synergies on a company-wide scale and building a foundation for differentiated products and services by surpassing organizational boundaries with the launch of the integrated leadership system was also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interconnection of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500BCE mean before the common era?

BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of BCE in recent years based on the idea that it should be written this way.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

Although there are matters of taste, I don't think the "desu/masu style" is suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I'd like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait, their jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that falls into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch prey, revealing only its disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, only exposing their head, which is shaped like a disc.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from an ant's perspective?
I wonder.
If you translate "armoured heads" into "circular head", the part that says "It's a giant monster wearing an armor in ant scale" will disappear, right...?
In Aichi 24 Vehicle Collision, Trailer Driver Has No Pre-Existing Condition, Was It Carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in which 24 cars collided, had no underlying illness and that the accident was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles such as trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people suffered minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the first collision accident and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him for prosecution on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of the Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, Nomura suspect had no illness, and it was found that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises of the related parties and investigating the situation in detail at the time.

Review of Kinnikuman X (Oginuma X): Comic Volume 4 (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from Volume 3, will be concluded in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks focused on only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started before the match!
In one word, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it should be noted that it is not a volume that only depicts the matches in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes that are different from before, but we can't go to the match yet, but it's not necessarily boring.
As the tension of the beginning of the century's war gradually increases in the work, it is certainly connected to the rising tension of the reader, and I can't help but marvel at how this period was so carefully calculated for the production.
And before the important final, there is one more match that can't be missed, the 3rd place deciding match between Terri-man and Ramen-man.
In addition to the luxuriousness as a battle card, what I like is that before the match, the Ramen Man shouts towards the Kinnikuman poster, "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!”
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, accepted the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with a silent stare and the two parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
However, there is such a passionate debate about Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now!
The fight between the two didn't last long, but the highlight of the match was Ramenman's appeal of tears after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of divine luck towards Kinnikuman!"
It is a line of dialogue.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, and I think readers have subconsciously felt that Kinnikuman will ultimately win because he is the protagonist, even if he doesn't necessarily win through strength.
However, by allowing Ramenman to make this statement, Yudetamago Sensei preemptively drove home the point that this hand could no longer be used.
With this one phrase, the reader is thinking, "Wait, does Kinnikuman really defeat Robin with his strength?"
How?
It will surely stimulate our imagination with the unpredictable development, and from the perspective of the writer, this is like a line of dialogue where the creator of the work has imposed a restriction on himself.
Wow, you did an amazing thing.
I think this is definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held in Takahama Town Aoba Mountain (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba Mountain Herb Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "We were surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find a place like this."
She was saying that it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healed while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event, including a button pot and a movie screening.

The Yamaoka Shimbun reports on the Niigata Prefectural Livestock and Agriculture Promotion Association's online delivery and promotion of agricultural and livestock products from Kaminoyama, Yamagata.
The Okishima Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns, and JAs in the Okishima region, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce," which distributes video over the Internet while selling products, on the 11th.
The Tokyo Minato Market TV, which was first planned by the Minato Ward of Tokyo, featured the Yamagata Love Musashi Corps in a remote appearance, delivering the charm of the region along with local specialties.
The "Okitama x Minato Opening Port Project", a collaboration between the Oki-tama area and the Minato Ward, was decided to be set up and broadcast from Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranomachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier," wears a Nitorto (Nitorto) brand stole from Yonezawa Weaving and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan's movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not starting up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up for a moment and the fan starts to move but stops immediately.
After that, he said nothing.
Even after unplugging the power plug and trying again, it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, and removing all other parts, the system still will not boot.
5.) Since there had been times when a sound like "buzz buzz buzz" was heard, I suspect that it might be caused by the PSU and not something else.
I will try to find an ATX power supply that is left over and try it out later.
Probably.
What should I do if it doesn't work?

I haven't used it before, but it seems that Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I would like to hear the opinion of anyone who knows it, as I am thinking of trying it out.
Bulky waste (paid) , Addendum> Municipal collection box (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it second-hand.
Addendum > Mercari, Hard Off
Have you ever sold a used PC at a flea market or auction? I haven't.
It might be a wise choice to sell while it is still worth money.

The broken printer that no one will take, the old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost any money, but it's being put off for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, bills can be exchanged but coins cannot be exchanged.
As commemorative coins contain gold, they have value.
Even if they didn't do anything wrong, there are still people who don't like them, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes since we are human.
People who don't like something (for no reason) are like that.

She can't do it, but is she being discriminated against by her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that you can judge by appearance.
It can't be seen on the surface.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduation?
I usually wear it as casual wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, Yome was still wearing her pajamas. LOL
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
All lust and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.
Men's Volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's Fencing, Freel finishes in 4th place and does not win a medal.
Dragon God Japan, 8th place after 29 years! The men's volleyball Japanese representative advances to the final T. Coach Nakagaki "It was a big goal".
I thought I was done for when I lost the third set in a row in the Referee Challenge x2, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
It seems like the opponent in the semi-finals was in a different class, so why is that opponent in the third-place deciding match?
I would like to plant a tree in the garden to provide shade, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As a hope, it would be better if it was an evergreen tree that was easy to take care of and could bear fruit.
Thank you in advance.
To get fruit from a feijoa tree, it is best to plant other fruit-bearing trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby so that it will bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to live together without any difficulty?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of parting.
It is best to make a matchmaker properly, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
There are no benefits to cohabitation.
I think it would be best to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a Legend Rare, but it was a re-release Legend Rare (^_^;)
Is there any game that uses cards like Ganbaraising as a hobby?
I think it's a ant.
