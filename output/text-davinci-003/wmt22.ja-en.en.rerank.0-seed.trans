When I tried to buy the entry package, blue and orange packages came out.

If there is one, it might just be the old product left over.

Since there are things like that, I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
Clearly, it's not funny, but it's creepy that people say "you have to laugh at everything a popular comedian says" as if it's a given.
But if the staff don't laugh, it'll ruin the comedian's mood, and it'll be unpleasant to work with them, right?
It's like a black company from the past, and that industry seems to be like a physical education association, and some entertainers' egos are too big, so they seem to take a normal unpleasant attitude, and if they don't do that, they won't be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work and say "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but I'm not going to be told every time that being a comedian is a difficult job and that I need to reach the top.
It sounds like a justification for the too high position of comedians in the media and society for the beautification of their own careers.
To be honest, there are quite tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel that things related to the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like if I didn't let it out, like a fart, it wouldn't be good for my body...

Get the hairbrush ready!
A sample will be given to the purchaser.
The item I ordered from Tsutaya Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I had to return it.
Rather than talking about self-made PCs, it's a problem with online shopping, but I can't accept it no matter how I think about it, so let me write it here since it's a well-known place.
The starting point was when I discovered that the MSI wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop Tsukumo Day Sale that started from last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Link Taku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order confirmation email arrived normally, and the shipping confirmation email arrived the next day.
In both of these emails and in my page's purchase history, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the order to the shipment, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point since there were no miscommunications or cancellation notifications.
Here's the problem, a few hours after shipping we got an email saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your response.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page is divided between the wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, emails, and delivery notes all say wireless version.
Isn't it terrible that they sent a different product than what I bought without my consent and they want me to return it if I want a refund?
In the end, I want to retaliate with something like accepting a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for marriage or a partner, would you not want to associate with someone whose relationship with their family is bad?

Even with parents and siblings, there can be various personalities and unreasonable people, which can lead to bad relationships.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside world was washed away due to a typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies (Yamaki Town, Fukushima Prefecture) (Fukushima Television) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara District in Yamatsuri, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a big impact on the lives of 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was broken so quickly, like it was swept away," The only road connecting the Takachi Hara District, "Takachi Hara Bridge," was swept away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not allowed, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Kōro Matsumoto: "Normally I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car and had to carry it or carry it across the iron bridge and walk here, I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was set up.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I think we should try to secure at least two to three days' worth of food," said the official. We have stocked up on canned food and cup noodles, which can also be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, but since you don't know when a disaster will strike you, I felt again that it's better for everyone to prepare a little bit." On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" of a bridge being washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Yatsuri Town Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryūichi: "We have established it as 'Yatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards. We have also made an announcement about it."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were provided, and those who visited the venue wore special equipment to run the marathon course of the Paralympics reproduced in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, an avatar of oneself appears and one can experience a competition like running a marathon course together with participants from inside and outside the country. Furthermore, one can enjoy sightseeing spots in the metropolitan area.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
"Running while seeing the scenery of Tokyo like this is tough, but it's really fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure that people can enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system is doing well in used housing transactions.
Both the prices of detached houses and condominiums have been rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of living in one's own home has been increasing due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "in front of the station", "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale" and "tower", and this may also be influenced by the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan still remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a survey called "inspection" for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate and Building Transaction Business Act (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including the deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the purchase and sale transaction, which can give the buyer a sense of security.
It can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer's side, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party in charge of building condition surveys is mainly the seller's side.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system was mandatory.
In other words, real estate businesses in charge of intermediation have an obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking abroad, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom. There is a risk of concern with the seller-led inspection.
Before the sale of a house, the buyer can request a building inspection from an expert called an inspector or building surveyor.
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, 70-90% of the transactions for existing homes are inspected.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the seller-oriented one.
The seller side will try to show the condition of the building as good as possible, sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey content and thinking of carrying out appropriate repairs so that they can live comfortably.
Even though it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy in the objectives and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection survey based on the seller-led type prescribed by the country is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned project can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted with "consideration" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

It was quite tough.
However, I had mentally recovered, so I was full of motivation.
Because I was a researcher and my body wasn't keeping up, I would sometimes fall asleep during work.
Since this was the second time in a year, I thought of taking a break for a month and parting ways with the shitty company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it dragged on for a while.
In any case, it is important to go to a psychiatric hospital and get proper treatment, as well as to keep a record of your visits (extremely important).
If you have a history of hospital visits, even if you resign for personal reasons, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the judgment of a doctor at the Hello Work, so the hurdles to receiving unemployment insurance and so on will be drastically lowered.
Even if it's hard to find a job, or if you want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

Was Ginza an island?
Five trivia topics you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula in the past.
As evidence of that ... ..., it's only in Ginza that you can show off a bit of trivia.
Let me introduce you to some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to share with someone after you learn it.
Go up Ginza! ?
First infiltration into the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines scattered around the area.
We were walking around Ginza and suddenly the silence was broken with "This used to be a peninsula back in the day."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The Ginza, the epitome of a bustling city that has created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint where silver coins were made, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year) the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was moved to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawachō", but when it moved to Ginza it became known by the nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
From before the Edo period, the Inari River flowed into the Marunouchi area from Hibiya, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
Then, the soil that had been dug out from the moat and the Kanda mountain were cut down and the inlet was filled in.
Why not try looking for the stone monument of "Ginza's Place of Origin" that indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Tiffany & Co. Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) if you are interested?
A pilgrimage to the Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibei Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabukiza Theatre.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who come to worship before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, the "Ryukou Fudou Son" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and the "Ginza Deseche Jizō Son" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi Ginza Terrace.
The "Hōtō Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwai Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwai Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The "Seikō Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" where the fox greets you was built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, as it brings the benefit of "abundant harvest of five grains" where the rice grows well.
This eventually led to the belief that there were benefits to be gained from business prosperity in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, Japan's most prosperous city, faith spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if I had hypersensitivity.
The nerve has been cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to make the pain go away quickly.
Before the treatment, when I touch my tooth, I have a sharp pain, will it get better in a few days?
The pain reliever doesn't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.
Take care.

Recruitment Script Compilation Method & Existing MOD Script Modification Method
I looked around a lot and tried my best, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that purpose so I can start from MO2 without running the script source or resources, but I don't understand how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorial, but there's only information on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...?

During the Greater East Asia War, were most of the military personnel government officials?
Almost all of them are not, but all of them are now called civil servants.
Since the military itself is an organization of the state, people who are said to be drafted under the conscription system are considered to be state civil servants in terms of organization.

A male body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoinagawa River in Nakashidami, Moriyama-ku, and reported it to 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he had died at the scene.
The police are quickly verifying the identity and investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
Although there was no disorder in the men's clothing, it is said that there was a bicycle fallen nearby.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity and investigate the situation at the time.
Regarding the payment of the non-taxable household allowance in the middle of February, if there is one non-taxable person in the household, will it be paid?

Korean Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, POSCO International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia, as well as an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the remaining procedures such as the approval at the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the approval of the local corporation, the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition will be the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, and it was decided that Posco International would invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy would invest 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas will divide the market with green hydrogen, which led to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Could the pain in your knee be "osteoarthritis" ?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been having continuous knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can be various, such as injury, joint rheumatism, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "rheumatoid arthritis".
Editorial Department: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to cushion shocks and smooth the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in joints other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the foot, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial: So, what kind of structure does a joint have?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where these two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage" and the joint is surrounded by "joint capsule".
Editorial Department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Inside the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the knee movement smoother, which is why.
Editorial: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion role, isn't it?
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause deformity of the joint and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basically pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the wash, I wear something like a tracksuit to sleep!
Even for heavy smokers, are there people who can quit smoking and people who can't quit?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he just felt like giving up, so he ended up giving up.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Experience for Real (with Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game with life at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my feet tingle ... ... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a planning video.
■Swamp The pachinko with traps featured in the gambling abstinence record Kaiji is called "Swamp".
In the original work, Kaizi was shocked by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This swamp had large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-Step Cruun" set up, and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl aquarium on the building to cause the foundation to sink and tilt, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The "Iron Cross Crossing" that was implemented on debtors including Kaiji at the "Star Side Party" hosted as a pastime by the rich was a "Human Horse Race" Iron Cross Crossing.
The debtor advances carefully so as not to fall from the thin iron frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win a prize, but there are only four iron beams and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, not only was it developed as a VR game, but it is also possible to experience something very similar at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
This Eagle Bridge is a one-piece steel bridge extending to a point 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and "Sky Bungee" and "Victory Bridge" are provided ahead of it, and you can walk to it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Corera Kōarashi released a video on his own YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, saying that it was an experience that could be had in Japan, and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Divide into Emperor's side and Slave's side and play with a total of 10 cards, 1 Emperor's card and 8 Citizen's cards and 1 Slave's card.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ear cut off.
After a hard fight, Kaiji realized that his ears, like the attached earphones, were being read by a device that sensed and transmitted changes in pulse and body temperature, so he shaved his ears to the extreme and made his body abnormal to confuse Rinkai and won.
The E-Card is commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and other stores.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video in which he plays a game of E-card with actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, and it caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the new year, gently pushing forward - a large votive horse of the Tora Shrine in Yamagata Prefecture | Yamagata Shimbun
The large votive horse of the zodiac sign "Tora" (Boar) for the coming year appeared at the Kenkokushinjya Shrine (Yamagata City) as preparations for the New Year continue.
On the 11th, design students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University for the original drawings of the ema since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese Painting Course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Suehara Toshimitsu, Yuichi Tsuchiya (age 22) was selected.
The large ehma is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya-san said he painted an image of the cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping in place, the figure of the tiger looking at the cherry blossom flowers was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, one can still have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature".
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the ema generally distributed.
Gonnegi Kenichi (44) from Chiba said, "I think I can be of help to everyone in overcoming their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano, where I want to continue living" - Proposals from a 4-high school student workshop: San Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the raw voices of young people will be compiled and proposed to the mayor.
"What makes you happy?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and people from the local area discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" while moving around an island with each person assigned a theme in a World Cafe approach.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems like an interesting town with many young people." "Public transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
Are there any common points? Let's discuss further.
"I used to think Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the sea is attractive," said 18-year-old Tamano Commercial High School third-year student.
18-year-old students from Binan High School talked with adults, and noticed not only the issues of the area but also its charm, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's a great place with lots of nature."
The second meeting in December will be attended by high school students only, to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the director of education and make an announcement in February next year.
The president of the same center said, "In addition to fostering a sense of attachment to one's hometown among high school students, it could be a trigger for young people to take an active role in town development."
In the Kanto region, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake with a seismic intensity of 4 was reported with the epicenter in the southern part of Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News

According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, with a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude (M) of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0.
There is no worry about the tsunami.

Finding a New Way to Wind a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is indispensable in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding it, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices saying that they don't quite understand the trick.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that would not wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, and then I found something innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I saw it for the first time, I thought, "Can it be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if weaving a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is in a net-like pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edges of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, it can be wound and secured without joining the ends together.
It's very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
Get Buck is a Peter Jackson directed movie.
It feels like the Beatles in their rawest form, it's all fresh and new...
We're on the verge of disbanding, so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying hard to keep the group together, there were Pauls who were annoying with lines like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!", George who would hesitate and say "But...", John who was always late and didn't seem motivated, and Ringo who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a troubled expression...
We didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very familiar atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had that same feeling. What would you call it, a legendary breakdown?
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase and gradually building it up to "that famous song" while asking each other "how about this?" is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track Get Buck is finished is amazing.
A subtle hum-hum-hum like a nose song gradually turns into a Zucha♪ Zucha♪ and the scene where the lyrics come in is firmly recorded, it's amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, it doesn't happen very often.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is so full of energy that just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three has been released so far, but my impression is that the biggest cause of the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
Despite all the complaints, when they started making music, they seemed to be having fun, but when it came to the topic of where to have their live performance, the producer and the people in charge of promotion started talking in a Beatles-like manner, and it was easy to see that the members had no say in the matter.
Well, since a documentary involves the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe Paul supervising it was the reason why there were a lot of scenes where Paul seemed like a villain.

How strong is Berserk's Guts compared to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't do it
Don't call out the technique name before performing the technique.
I thought that since you have a serious personality, you feel a sense of responsibility and your heart has become strained without any room for leisure.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities myself, but I felt that I was very suited to sales activities that were requested by customers, so I switched to a different industry and found it much easier to work.
Even though I was asked about what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, my life will be a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest so that you can have some peace of mind before considering this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there is a labor union at the company, an industrial doctor or a window for consultation, it may be better to consult there, as there may be some system.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have occurred frequently in the United States, causing major damage due to unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this time of year caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, resulting in the rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest to the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on both Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air flowing southward below -30°C near 5500m in the upper atmosphere, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued on a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday alone, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength (on the Fujita scale) reached the third strongest level out of six, with gusts of wind reaching around 70m/s.
There is a possibility that it will be classified as EF4-5 according to future surveys.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
The JEF3 equivalent to this American tornado has a high possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses can collapse.

From under the "historic largest" rice dragon roll, voices calling for help were broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, on the 11th (Japan time 12th), President Biden expressed his opinion with a solemn expression, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
Reported by US CNN TV and others.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can".
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
In Kentucky, which was affected by the tornado, residents carry household goods and furniture from damaged houses. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As for the range of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that caused damage to Missouri and other states in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the maximum scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Meadfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that was operating 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas season also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
Under a thick pile of rubble about 1.5 meters deep in the darkness, a woman who was unable to move felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above the rubble and asked for help through a live broadcast on Facebook from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the broadcasted live stream, the sound of "Happy Birthday To You" sung by another woman, seemingly in an attempt to mask her fear, was also heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued, and they were safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumble from the ground," he reflected.
The police officer of the Mayfield City Police said, "The search activities will continue until they are no longer necessary."
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take, but I continued the rescue efforts earnestly.
In Illinois, part of a warehouse belonging to the major online retailer Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of being detached from the carriages, and the highway is also being blocked one after another due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 households, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What can I do to increase it?
Take high-protein foods and drinks
Avoid coarsely chopped raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying that something can be done
It would be nice if there were "live-in work opportunities" such as inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and an income source, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.
I just Googled and it looks like there's a site like this ↓,
Live-in Part-time Job / Regular Employee Job - Live-in Job Search Navi (Suminavi)
There are "bargain, live-in, job" in the related search, so it seems that many of my colleagues are of that kind.
For bank accounts and line contracts, if you have an address for the first time, it will somehow work, but for credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't update without an address (because a new card is sent to the registered address).
What does it mean to be a specialist doctor in gynecology?
A "senior specialist" is a doctor in the 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Late-Term Trainee Doctor".
The so-called "resident doctor" refers to a "first-year resident doctor", which is a doctor in the first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, when I reach 4 to 5 years of experience, I will be able to do a certain level of medical care, and I will be entrusted with various tasks.

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries deduct points from a five-star rating system, the argument is that Japan should take a neutral three-star rating and add or subtract points from there.
At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings, "there are elements that need to be deducted" and "it is not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we set the standard at five stars, then "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level" are on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used, I understand why you don't want to give three stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, if you try to refute the argument of those who advocate this view with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and can fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity from a USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump varies depending on the model, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.
The numbers are vastly different.

The Making of a Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the one I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right..
So here's the main point, I was supposed to make an AM radio but it sounds like an FM radio.
Why do you think so? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the ESPs for SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a loose file in an appropriate location, then it does not need ESP.
I remember seeing a story somewhere about that, but I can't remember where I saw it...
I understand the risks, so I don't plan on actually doing it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers, could you please tell me if it's okay to do it?
Thank you for your submission.

<Saga Eating Record> "Hakobune" "Freshly caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living/Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box "Freshly caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce."
"Hakobune," a take-out specialty store with a colorful and abundant bento and deli (souzai) using plenty of vegetables.
"We want people to be able to experience the feeling of a restaurant even at home," said Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple, who opened it in August last year.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Fried fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available at the market at that time.
According to Mr. Kiyoshi, the batter for fried food is made as thin as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be directly perceived. Therefore, the texture of shrimp fried food is crispy and can be directly perceived.
The bento box includes four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Saga Prefecture-grown Hinohikari rice with mixed grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are sourced from the family-grown field next to the house, or from direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dish varies depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyo has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, they have a mix of Japanese and Western flavors that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, such as the "comforting taste of rolled eggs" (Yumi-san).
The bento "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to come across something interesting at Haneda Airport, so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's safe because the speed was reduced or even completely stopped when there were people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze of those around me hurts; it's good to be seen, but it feels like they're looking at me like I'm a nuisance, and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if there were some consideration, such as asking them to move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
I thought it was a great vehicle because I could relax and take in the scenery while taking it slowly, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a vehicle that was difficult to ride unless you had a strong heart, with a sense of excitement for the near future of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings.
It was so embarrassing.

If you look closely, you might understand a bit, but this is a bowl of eel without any sauce.
The answer is "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the answer)
I like eel, but when I thought that everyone is just eating it with sauce and that the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly...I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I don't want the eel to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat it.
Recipe Used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (Sprinkled with yam pepper instead of scallions.)
I just fried it in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.
I am 20 years old.

Around October, I was considering taking a break, and with my half-hearted sense of responsibility, I finally reached my limit.
I'm quitting my job and I'm thinking of giving up IT.
But I don't know how to live from now on.
I had worked at a supermarket part-time, but I couldn't even do that kind of job (so I was doing engineering part-time).

One man was cut off and escaped on a motorcycle on the 12th in Saga City Otsu, a attempted murder case | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, on the street of Daizai 1-chōme in Saga City, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and Saga South Police Station is pursuing him as a attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "there is a fight".
The man sustained an injury about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and they are investigating whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities at the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong Enterprise Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the number of mammal species being the highest in the world and the number of plant species being the third highest in the world.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities by local governments, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan Province, located in southwest China, is also one of such regions.
Ms. Li Wenda, my younger sister, is currently active as an actress. Si Sa Pan Na is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and it is an area where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group who share the same roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people (Xishuangbanna Dai) covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Ms. Li Minhua in person at Sichuan-Tibet Plateau and heard about her environmental protection activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Ms. Li, we started our environmental protection activities "Tianni" in 2000.
The trigger was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seychelles for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts a number of biological diversities.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to root an industry in this region and to produce rubber which was lacking in China, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests was carried out previously.
He was dispatched here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here I met a journalist I knew and got married.
Before that, did Mr. Lee not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li, I am from Cispanana, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I had to push forward the project with my husband.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or an especially tall stature, I sometimes see people who have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out in the moment you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of self-confidence on the inside.

I was just wondering, is it too detailed to comment on someone's outfit or say something like "that color looks nice"?
It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I haven't been told to praise in detail, so I'm not quite sure what it means.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yokomine Sakura?
I replied, "My heart is blooming with joy after your confession, so I'd be happy to go out with you," and we started dating.
And, in order to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
If I choose not to open a NISA account when opening a Rakuten Securities account, can I open one at a later time?
Opening them at the same time will make the procedure faster to complete.

Furthermore, since there are no fees, we recommend opening a NISA account so that you can use it whenever you want.

【Omakan / Personal Notes】It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
Due to lack of playtime since the Golden Week, multiple CTDs caused by various factors have occurred until March, and it took a long time to identify them as we could only investigate a little bit during the holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (it would have been clear in a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
The main timing of the CTD
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins that log.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activation with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement * Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
For some NPCs, camera work when activating kill moves is improved by setting kill moves to OFF via .ini for PCs. Is there a conflict in settings related to DAR+Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 for DAR animations.
(Mainly outdoors) During field movement + some magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use the Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application settings (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times in a row to improve everything.
Could it be caused by additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although there are formatting mistakes in the 2.0 SPID default.ini, it should still result in the intended outcome and the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
Initially, we focused heavily on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MOD (.dll) and ended up with this kind of result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there were anyone in a Japanese language environment with a similar CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it as a memo.
Everyone is doing it with barely enough mental strength.
Nobody around me notices it, not even my colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, wow, that person looks like they're having a tough time, but they're still working hard and staying energetic.
I guess he's also on the brink of mental exhaustion.
Although I haven't officially retired in name of mental health, I think I was at my limit right before I retired.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits-Now that today's visit is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have built a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, the home visit nurse does the necessary things for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply impressed by how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and we even joked around about it.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desires, or why she got divorced, and things like that - is it okay to do that in home visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations operated by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or when an occupational therapist comes to the visiting nursing station, they are given orders in a condescending manner, such as "This is a medical facility, after all".
I am using a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, but I think the nurses are really good, facing me equally and frankly even though I have a mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits, and there may also be people who are considering receiving them.
Home visits by nurses can be very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor approves, please take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to terminate contracts because the terms just didn't agree with me.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was startled when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.
Language detection malfunction
The browser settings are set to English priority.
The ranking of the lottery 6 draws by the number of appearances is all odd numbers.

But I can't concentrate on work at home.
I get anxious and immediately reach for my cell phone.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One Fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced its hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The content was that by 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be popularized (cumulative) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (approximately 117 locations) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilo is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target value.
The Japan Association of National Economy (Zenkeiren) released a report on "Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem Status and Policy Directions" on the 12th.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The carbon fiber core material of fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are lower-ranked among competing countries."
The order of patent applications by country is China, USA, EU, Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, the gap has been widening.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974 cases) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of China (4721 cases).
The Zenkeiren proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large amount of investment and research and development expenses deductible from taxes."

Was the number of older sisters and wives during the Meiji and Showa eras comparatively small compared to now?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so common that the phrase "sister-in-law wife" is being said around.
And, it seems that in those days, since it was said that "even if you wear a golden headscarf, look for a wife who is one year older," there were probably more wives who were older than now during the Meiji and Showa eras.

Is it a crime to sell items at a higher price than the regular price in a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at the store for 70,000.
It is legal.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for the price to go up.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the original price.

Takaizumi is making a TV program-style flyer while the council reform is in progress, and the "communication book" of the council members: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Town Council of Taka-su is undertaking unique council reforms, such as creating an eye-catching flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate their council members.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive no-vote, aiming to get the townspeople to take an interest.
To inform about the Sunday Assembly to be held on the 12th, 1800 new leaflets were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Live Giron from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Sawaguchi Hito Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had catchy phrases reminiscent of popular TV shows.
Hyoei Katayama (43), the created legislator, said "I want you to come to the legislature with a smile on your face."

US aid weapons and ammunition have arrived in Ukraine, and troops are also engaged in training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by the 12th.
The military assistance is equivalent to a total of 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, etc., will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the US Department of Defense spokesman, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the reinforcement of forces carried out by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is strengthening its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, and is also discussing with the NATO member countries and drawing up measures to respond in case Russia decides to launch an attack on Ukraine.
President Biden approved the provision of arms assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House in September this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, we dispatched state troops from the US state of Florida in accordance with a multilateral joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US special operations forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hands" of lifetime gifts, direct hit on Masaru Amano, former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is a "pre-mortem gift and rush inheritance technique".
While the discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the fiscal year 2022, which was a concern, but in the near future, the possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" is great.
How will the rules of succession change?
Along with a direct hit to the former Tax Commission Chairman and House of Representatives Member, Kanemaru, I will impart everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques in order to make it in time for the end of the year and get a good deal on the rush gift.
(Diamond Editing Department, Kei Miyahara)
From wealthy families to urban company employees, the pre-death gift giving should be a "forbidden hand." From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with a full-scale examination towards constructing a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer.
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because the implication of what is being said is to change the rules of succession and to increase inheritance taxes by making "gifts before death" a forbidden act, which is the mainstream inheritance tax countermeasure.
The iron rule for tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is "reducing the assets subject to taxation".
The pre-mortem gift, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees in the three major metropolitan areas who have a small amount of inheritance tax generated from their homes.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although it was not included in the Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, the policy towards integration was re-established with more detailed wording such as "review the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
Former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party and former Chairman of the Tax System Research Council, Kanemaru, said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to avoid the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of asset transfer and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration. If the amendment is made at the fastest speed, there are only three chances left for pre-mortem gifts.
Even without that, it seems likely that in the near future, a large step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax saving measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】The heroine, Kanon Yamaya, stars in this heart-wrenchingly pure love story, based on the manga of the same name by Morie Satoshi, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018. It follows a man and woman carrying the burden of the past.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Risae, is played by Yamayagi Kanjū.
Riso, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Kairi.
Kaori, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is attracted to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents by divorce, but is Kairi a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yuudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
Those who were unable to watch FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already watched it should be able to gain a deeper understanding of the work by seeing the complex psychological depiction of Karie and Riseto, as well as their conflicting and changing relationship.
I am delighted if even the fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

After the team won the NFL game with only three passes, what were the players feeling and how? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had exceeded 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in history.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the run of both LeSean McCoy and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, a wind of 18 m/s was blowing fiercely, and it was snowing before the game.
Since the Bulls were local, they didn't make many changes to their play selection.
Passes 30 times versus runs 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not bad.
There were four red zone penetrations in the 10 offensive series and scoring opportunities.
In particular, from the end of the third quarter onwards, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to score 3 points in one FG in those three times.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd & 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He then threw a pass targeting TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stephon Digs was running a slant route and was open in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the end zone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant and ended in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen, who had overlooked two receivers, threw two passes aiming for the end zone.
The 4th down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on the 3rd down.
You need to get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if he had gone for 4th and short, Allen's own running ability should have come alive.

It's time to replace the items that have been in the kitchen for a long time - here are three items to choose from (Harper's BAZAAR).
Sponge
No matter how often it is changed, it is probably not changed as often as recommended, which is probably the case for sponges.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if a kitchen sponge is sterilized in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (even so, it is still recommended to sterilize it in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The US Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when the cutting board starts to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria proliferate.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or lightly pat with a clean paper towel to remove the water.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cutting lips or spilling drinks in the missing parts.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged Righteous General Guan Yu, posted by Builder Yujin
Submerged hero Guan Yu said, "Oi, Yu Jin!"
No smoking.
"Yukin won't die even if 30,000 arrows come raining down on him."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get swallowed up by the muddy waters of the river, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"So can we hold the underwater bridge for three quarters of an hour?"
"Ussu Ussu"
"So, make sure you practice so you can endure until the next battle at Fancheng!"
"Ussu!"
Is it a promise?
"I understand!"
"Someday you might be killed by Cao Cao and I wouldn't even know!"
Saying that, the righteous general went home.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water attack, water bridge three quarters practice! We absolutely can't do it without putting handcuffs and shackles on and locking them in a cage and sinking them.
Did you read the article at the link I quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community market and trade are two different things.
At the community market, we use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been victims of scams where they are left with only the item and no money paid.
That won't happen
Trade is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different topic?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even for simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even for intellectual labor.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I swapped out the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that kept blinking without stopping.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be an old USB memory or using an SD card with an adapter.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
If it's something inconspicuous, I can carry it, but I can't carry something like Louis Vuitton with a monogram with "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one you call by my last name/talk to in a rude way?"
If they say it doesn't matter because they are a foreigner, it's best to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I would have even dreamed of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly decent probability.
I was living overseas halfway, but the Japanese who went out, including me, hated the Confucian etiquette from top to bottom, and there were quite a few people who came, and I felt like the tag was off, and I misunderstood that I could say anything to the locals.
If it looks like it to Westerners, I think it's without any malice, more like a kind of spoiledness or a friendly attitude.
Even though my friend is from Europe or the Americas, I usually call them by their first name, but when speaking in Japanese, I sometimes hesitate for a moment about which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's with friends.
It's probably just ordinary behavior, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say it now.
Can you talk to me according to Japanese rules because it's Japan?
Study: My white friend who naturalized has a habit of always raising his glass higher than the others at drinking parties, even though it's unrelated.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but if I do it that way, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
Regardless of personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details, so it's annoying.

Thank you for 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created sub had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday the number of subscribers was 25 people, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50 people, but for some reason today 25 people subscribed, so I am really grateful.
For those of you who subscribed to this sub-reddit today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let us know in the comments section where you found out about this sub-reddit! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Currently, there is only one person creating threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.

Since I only have the ability to understand a little English, I will only judge based on the translated text.
The translated text may feel a bit off in terms of its wording, but I can understand the message it is trying to convey and I think it is at a level where it won't be a hindrance to playing (I'm only saying this from my own perspective, so it might be best to ask others as well).
You often see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, it feels like they are well translated.
I think for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it may take a long time of studying to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, I suggest you look for someone else.

Consideration: Training is the battle in "Demon Slayer".
"Equal Exchange of Effort" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Start Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the fact that there is an excessive amount of training.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles and the characters train regardless of day or night, is not popular among readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the two-year training of the Straw Hat Pirates was only touched upon and the rest was glossed over in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE".
Well, one-piece is one of the attractions of wandering land, but there are times when "staying in the same place and training" is not compatible.
So, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled before the life-saving Togata Giyu and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, and was told by Giyu, "Don't let anyone else hold the power of life and death!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they are all forced to submit to the powerful by force... ...
While saying that, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness (though he was also a bad communicator who didn't explain his intentions) to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps.
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" Tanjiro was at a loss for words, so Rengoku delivered a single punch with the comment "You take too long to decide".
Among the fans, it's an unreasonable exchange that looks like a gossip at first glance.
However, walking with a sister who has become a demon carries the possibility that a moment may come when such a judgment is forced upon them.
It can be said that initiation is the preparation of the mind before entering into practice.
Rin Takadzukuri orders Tanjiro to take him to Mt. Hagaromo, even though Tanjiro is still an inexperienced novice, and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls such as air holes and rock-throwing machines, and traps, and it seems like one could die before even starting the training.
Still, with his sharp sense of smell, he can detect the faint scent of a trap set by a person, and somehow manages to avoid it, which is what is called the "protagonist correction".
Nevertheless, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba that makes Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become physically stronger enough to avoid all of that!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any proof, and awakening is just using the power and techniques that have been honed so far to their full potential.
"The equivalent exchange of effort" is a human anthem that is different from a demon with the power of an unfounded supernatural force, and it is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work; those who make an effort will be rewarded accordingly, and those who do not make an effort will not be rewarded at all.
Is this old?
Sleeping without a bed, directly on the floor with a futon, a quilt, and a comforter is a way of sleeping.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will it be difficult?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "strict".
I think of it as "gumption" to devise a plan to get more benefit than effort with the least effort possible.

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Department" integrating home appliances and mobile phones, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into a single division called the DX (Device eXperience) division, the company announced on the 12th that it would reflect this in its organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be read that the intention is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division is composed of business units such as VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Network, which have been integrated from the CE and IM divisions.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change this time reflects the medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, they emphasized their intention to enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
The strategy of creating synergies on a company-wide scale and building a foundation for differentiated products and services by surpassing organizational boundaries with the launch of the integrated leadership system was also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interconnection of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.

BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of BCE in recent years based on the idea that it should be written this way.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

I'd like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait with their mouths open, only their armored heads visible above the sand... anything that falls into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch their prey, exposing only their disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand, ready to capture their prey, with only their disc-shaped head visible above the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?

I wonder?
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular head" would make the part "a giant monster wearing an armor of an ant's scale" disappear, right...?
24 vehicles collided in Aichi, the trailer driver had no pre-existing illness, was it carelessness? (Television Asahi Network (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in which 24 cars collided, had no underlying illness and that the accident was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the initial collision accident and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to be prosecuted on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, Nomura suspect had no illness and it was found that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises and investigating the situation in detail.

"Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News"
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from volume 3, will be concluded in this fourth volume!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted everything from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to the focus being narrowed down to only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●The Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started even before the match!
In a nutshell, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but what should be noted first is that it is not a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes that are quite different from before, but that doesn't mean it's boring at all.
As the tension of the start of the century's war gradually increases in the work, it certainly leads to the excitement of the readers, and I can't help but marvel at the fact that even this period was carefully calculated for the production.
And before the important final, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place deciding match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxuriousness as a battle card, what I like is the scene behind the scenes before the match, where Ramen Man is pointing to the poster of Kinnikuman and saying "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!"
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, received the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with a silent stare and the two parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a heated debate about Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now!
The fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was the appeal of Ramenman's tears after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of divine luck towards Kinnikuman!"
It's a line of dialogue.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers of Kinnikuman have been feeling a sort of implicit understanding that the protagonist will never lose and somehow always come out on top, even in situations where it isn't a matter of strength.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei had already taken the initiative and driven home the point that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one phrase, the reader thinks, "Wait, does Kinnikuman really defeat Robin with his strength?"
How?
It will also stimulate imagination for the unpredictable development ahead, and from another perspective of the writer, this is like a line of dialogue that the teacher who makes the work has imposed on himself.
Wow, you did an amazing thing!
I definitely think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aoba Mountain in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba Mountain Herb Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "We were surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find a place like this."
She was saying that it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healed while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, the 25th, a Christmas event is planned with activities such as button pot and movie screenings.
I think that only a few people can read through the documents in order.

It is easier to understand and apply if you learn from Linux rather than starting with something abstract like Docker.
It's quite tough to suddenly understand everything after skipping that part.

The Yamaoka Shimbun reports on the Niigata Prefectural Livestock and Agriculture Promotion Association's online delivery and promotion of agricultural and livestock products from Kaminoyama, Yamagata.
The Okishima Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns, and JA in the Okishima area, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products on the 11th, utilizing "Live Commerce," which distributes products while streaming video on the Internet.
The Tokyo Minato Market TV, which was the first project planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, featured the Yamagata Aisen Bujotai remotely, delivering the appeal of the region along with its special products.
The "Okitama x Minato Opening Port Project", a collaboration between the Oki-tama area and the Minato Ward, was decided to be set up and broadcast from Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranomachi, Yonezawa City.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I immediately shut it down.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not starting up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up for a moment and the fan starts to move but stops immediately.
After that, he said nothing.
Even after unplugging the power plug and trying again, it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and the ATX 20-pin and 4-pin and removing all other parts, the computer still does not start up.
5.) I have heard a buzzing sound before, so I suspect that it might be caused by the PSU, as it seems like something is hitting it.
I'll try to find an ATX power supply that I have left over and try it out the next day.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work out...I wonder what I should do.
Change the case and the mother together...?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?

I have brought it in once, but even though it is located in Saitama-shi, Saitama-ken won't collect it for free.
Relatively newer ones are free.
Inverse Net
I haven't used it before, but it seems like Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I would like to hear the opinion of anyone who knows about it since I'm thinking of trying it out.
Bulky waste (paid) , Addendum> Municipal collection box (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it second-hand.
Update > Mercari, Hard Off
Have people ever sold used PCs at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold one.
It may be a wise choice to sell while it's still worth money.
Note: Information provided by Linet Japan /u/CheetahPresent8059
The broken printer that no one will take, the old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's being put off for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated abroad have no value...
In Japan, bills can be exchanged but coins cannot be exchanged.
Since commemorative coins contain gold, they have value.
Even if he hasn't done anything wrong, can you still dislike him?
Yes, it is natural to have likes and dislikes since we are human.
People who don't like something (for no reason) are like that.

She can't do it, is she being discriminated against based on her looks?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that you can be judged by your looks.
It can't be seen on the surface.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduating?
I usually wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, Yome was still wearing her pajamas. LOL
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
All lust and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.
Men's Volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's Fencing, Freel finishes in 4th place and does not win a medal.
Dragon God Japan, 8th place after 29 years! The men's volleyball Japanese national team advances to the final T. Coach Nakagaki: "It was a big goal."
I thought it was over when I lost the third set in the referee challenge x2, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
It seems like the opponent in the semi-finals was in a different class, so why is that opponent in the third-place deciding match?
I would like to plant a tree in the garden to provide shade, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As a hope, it would be nice if it was a evergreen tree that was easy to maintain and preferably one that produces fruit.
Thank you in advance.
To get fruit from a feijoa tree, it is best to plant other fruiting trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby so that the feijoa tree will bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to live comfortably together without any difficulty?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of parting.
It is best to make a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
There are no benefits to cohabitation.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a Legend Rare, but it was a re-release Legend Rare (^_^;)
Is there any game that uses cards like Ganbaraising as a hobby?
I think it's a ant.
