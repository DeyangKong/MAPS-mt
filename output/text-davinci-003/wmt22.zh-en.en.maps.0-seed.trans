At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students sang the main role and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Network
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of creative academic achievements were honored, such as using air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for the source of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the Biomedical Engineering College demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a deep breath and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of the exhaled air."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smart wristbands on the market that can detect health conditions usually measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lights: High-powered eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new perspective on the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room due to inadequate early detection and removal."
Shen Junfei said that if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity, and the shadowless rate according to the surgical needs and personal preferences at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and looking cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qi Zhang and his classmates invented a set of "air hand-washing devices".
As soon as we stand on the apparatus washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
"That way, we can get our hands washed clean!"
The results of the visible color reaction and bacterial residue tests prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-leading universities and won the only gold prize.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when sudden events occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency medical help is needed.
If I really suffer from a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes to save our lives, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important to have people around you who know how to do first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrible.
In China, official data shows that every year three million people die from accidents, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest.
On average, 15% of those in the US can be saved.
At Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founding member of First Reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save a person.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
Who knows, it might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turn 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was also something I did a few months ago, and I'm glad to say I achieved it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, planning to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The 13 yuan shrimp dumpling is just one!?
Never tried it.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
Does it cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver the food, and this time I only got one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally think Four Seas is an all-around bad movie in every sense.
But you can't say that this movie doesn't have any highlights either, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. One kind can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and another kind can make you angry after watching it. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han really has an unparalleled talent.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creature from a classic novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may suspect that there are metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a pile of crap.
First, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
Are elderly people taking a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
Then the old man disappeared without a trace.
How did the female protagonist and her brother get the business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
Why are the island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a stretch of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the driver could not be found around.
The prop feels too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and suspected of criminal activity become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't they report the high-interest loan to the police in the movie, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a hotel key card, and then has to arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the film, and it is so outlandish that I feel pain when I recall it.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, it's just an abominable patchwork.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep doubt of yourself, why did you go to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays.
For most people, they are already very familiar with the tropes of various films. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate entanglement between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
For example, the character Yoon Jeong plays (the one whose new motorcycle was burned but still can sing), cannot explore ideas that even Kennedy couldn't withstand.
As for the female lead, who obviously isn't mentally challenged, yet acts like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the actor's performance or the director's requirement.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Chinese New Year film season just to give the audience a headache?

Introduction to the equipment for producing and processing concrete modules for inspection wells and Zhengzhou well wall brick modules:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well brick machine machinery, and well wall wall module machinery, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, the company now has high-quality products, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspect the concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Check the production and processing equipment of the well concrete module, the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin's inspection well brick-laying machine equipment is widely applicable to the new masonry materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example: various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of building inspection wells with concrete modules is that the modules have grooved structures on the top, bottom, left and right sides, which can be combined to form an interlocking structure.
The shear resistance of well wall is far superior to that of flat masonry formwork.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being assembled, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are penetrated. After pouring the core, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Grooves are provided in both the longitudinal and transverse directions of the module, and the lateral reinforcement and vertical reinforcement are correspondingly increased to enhance the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The intelligent control system of the concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display monitoring machine operation of the entire process, to achieve ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The hydraulic system of well wall wall module machinery adopts single cylinder hydraulic transmission and double cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box advances the model box demoulding and rising, the storage box door closes, the automatic conveying pallet, all completed independently by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce the mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing parts and hydraulic parts, ensuring the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table surface line cutting and molding without welding points make the filler box free to swing and guide, which can effectively reduce mechanical wear.
Reduce the load of the mold, fill and integrate the two-in-one compression amplitude, adopt integration, full synchronization, table vibration, and mold vibration to ensure the vibration solid effect.
The mechanical vibration machine of the well wall module, computer automatic control of the amplitude according to the cost performance of the raw materials to adjust the amplitude, no wear and tear braking, thus prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The wall module machine has both automatic and manual control functions.

Chongqing Vocational Schools are piloting the modern apprenticeship system, where students are considered quasi-employees of the enterprise upon enrollment - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise probationary employees be clarified, and a three-party agreement be signed by apprentices, schools and enterprises according to the principle of two-way selection. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, an agreement must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content and rights protection of apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with partner enterprises to carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for corporate employees.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation model.
School and enterprise jointly design talent cultivation plans, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training period as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program, and on-the-job training is generally 6 months.
Enterprises should implement an enterprise team-based management model. According to the characteristics of different specialties, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each rotating post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 city-level modern vocational apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having about 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Following the principle of piloting first and then implementing gradually from point to surface, explore and establish a long-term mechanism of joint school-enterprise enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and enhance the rate and quality of targeted employment.

South African doctors: Omecron is highly contagious, but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus Omnicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more vulnerable to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the last Delta outbreak, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first reported Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak cases in South Africa, the mortality rate was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It is still in the early stage, and we need to get later stage data.
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this pandemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rate, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although the Delta variant remains the most dominant coronavirus strain globally, cases of the Omega variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Hauden Province in the first week of December increased by 400%, with tests showing that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Times Commentary: What Can We Do to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we use the famous public welfare slogan "No buying and selling, no killing", then in a good environment without the demand for trafficking, collective prevention and nationwide anti-trafficking can make trafficking activities unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to quickly locate abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app, "Reunion", I feel a warmth and comfort.
Not only does the new technological means have a "literary" name full of sentiment, but it is also practical and effective when used properly with information technology.
The primary goal of anti-kidnapping enforcement is to locate and recover kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed in many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before a trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
While differentiating between matters of urgency and importance, topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death" which are highly controversial and have many different opinions can be put aside for now and discussed cautiously; however, rescuing trafficked children is something that cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
Every minute of delay in child abduction cases increases the difficulty of solving the case and puts the child one step further away from their parents.
In this situation, taking effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, combating human trafficking is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from family to society.
For example, a common case is when a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest and placing the children under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, those who purchase trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
An individual act of crime is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking shall be not less than five years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property may be confiscated.
With a high starting point of punishment and a maximum punishment, trafficking of children obviously belongs to a crime with heavier punishment under the trend of "leniency".
Even today, there are still many cases of human trafficking occurring every year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and lack legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the trafficking market is widely present, traffickers are driven by their greed and constantly innovate their trafficking methods, forming a "struggle" situation with law enforcement, anti-trafficking operations will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward thinking and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences with three aspects - ideals, beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leadership and party theory - to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the whole meeting in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the plenary session and the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, integrate and apply what we have learned, strengthen our ideological, political, and action awareness of upholding the "two establishements" and achieving the "two safeguards", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, grassroots cadres representatives, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to stay with the Party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and commitment with youth dedication.

It is not clear whether it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigatable
I hope you understand
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than what was displayed.
No more, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
They waited for several hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, pure taste and fragrant aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: It has an acceptable taste and flavor, with an acidity level not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the first-pressed olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3% is refined, or known as "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent with a light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil obtained by extracting and refining it from the oil residue through the dissolution method.
If you have seen the grading classification, you should have already noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be known that olives, just like grapes used for making wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, producing olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive tree growth is:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow crops sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and even countries far south of the equator such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, have similar climates.
The harvesting month for olives:
From March to June every year, olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for harvesting fruits (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, will conclude on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also expressed his intention to convene the second Global Democratic Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs committee member Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the Democratic Summit focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening remarks on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a pre-recorded speech at the summit, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of China's ethnic minorities such as the Uyghur and Tibetan.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threats of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason we must change."
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee Member Tang Feng released the National Statement through video, emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of resistance against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly on the front line of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used the pretext of public health and collective interest to justify the violation of human rights, indicating a global retreat of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down false information to win the battle.
On the second day of the Democratic Summit, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally it was #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I'm not calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver it?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I didn't receive any calls.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
We waited for a meal for half an hour.
Delivery has not been made by #PRS_ORG#.
I want to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hi, the saliva chicken delivered from the restaurant is raw.
If you want to try tennis but are afraid that you won't be able to stick with it, you can find a class at a reasonable price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level cameras" are actually industrial garbage.
They have low strength, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, the hard ball can't bear it, and skilled players find it difficult to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so hard, they know you can't learn it, they also know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so they make a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to my place to buy something expensive later, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly used racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not well-known, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one for 500 or 600 yuan is good enough, and a used one for 200 yuan. Isn't it great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket?
It is friendly to newbies, but it becomes useless after the novice stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Do I need to ignore the previous one?
Hi, we ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the sesame chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# unexpectedly asked me to take it away, please cancel it.
The order I placed requires delivery, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with slightly overweight bodies when it comes to dressing.
Girls with a bigger body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
Wearing skirts that are too short will reveal any excess fat on the legs.
Wearing clothes that are too long can give a feeling of being short and chubby.
If you divide your outfit into top, middle, and bottom, you will naturally appear taller. For example, wearing different colors for your top, skirt, and long socks will create a slimming effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are standard for petite plus-size girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for petite plus-size girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Avoid giving people the impression of obesity when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
Girls who are slightly overweight should definitely learn the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black thigh-high socks or fishnet stockings (the kind with thin grids). Choose a soft floral trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the shortcomings of a plus-size girl.
Of course, slightly overweight girls also have their own standards when it comes to wearing short skirts.
For plus-size girls wearing a short skirt, it is recommended to choose a top in the same color as the skirt, which will make your plump figure look taller.
Pairing a mini skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN fashion combination for summer!
If you are top-heavy but have slim legs, we recommend choosing a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your belly, but it can also show off your best features.
A-line skirts will look slimming, especially for plus-size girls. Choose tighter tops to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a skirt is also a great option for plus-size women to try.
Even a slightly chubby girl can wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in dressing, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of slightly overweight girls earlier😄

Xinhua All Media+ | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Ignites Winter Olympic Passion - Xinhua News Agency

The girl acted as a target for her sister's fundraising: "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise donations for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows that a girl was standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan a arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by could pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot.
The action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xicheng Branch, confirmed to a Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had taken such extreme action in order to raise money for her sister, but such behavior was not to be encouraged. After admonishment, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned for collecting donations on the street.
In the circulated picture, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat and Alipay accounts.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this act is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens have expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
When the police officers from the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site were interviewed by the local media, they said that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Lower City Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jia Li and she was raising donations for her elder sister Jia Yan.
But since the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, they had no better way to raise funds and resorted to this behavior.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were involved, one as the target and one as the assistant, but neither of them actually shot the arrows. No one was found shooting arrows during the process, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police investigation, the security department determined that the bow and arrow used did not fall under the category of controlled items.
The official stated that "this kind of fundraising for publicity is not encouraged".
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: Good, Slimness: Convenient, Appearance material: Satisfactory, Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
It has stable performance and four air outlets for efficient heat dissipation, making it a highly recommended product.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The Acer Predator Dragon is still reasonably priced.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. Game performance: The game performance is smooth, and I can play most games with a stable high frame rate, which is very smooth. LOL is not a problem, CSGO is also easily handled, and most AAA games can be played.
Heat dissipation is good, the fan is powerful, it works quietly, and gaming performance is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance Material: Cool and stylish appearance, the game laptop looks great. Display Effect: The screen is clear, 1080 is enough for playing games.
Buying a laptop was really great. It's mainly used for design and has a great cost-performance ratio. It's lighter than I expected and looks better too. The red on the back is a very nice wine color, not too flashy. Overall, it exceeded my expectations and was worth the purchase. It's also suitable for girls.
I started using Acer Predator two years ago and the cost-performance ratio has been quite high with excellent quality!
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
We have already purchased three machines from this series!
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also good.
I wanted to wait for the 418 bank promotion to buy something for my nephew, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
The price-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back and review it after a while.
A brand new, cost-effective gaming laptop with a great design, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a computer for a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can do 3D design work.
He said it was great that I bought it for my son.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand, highly recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics for playing games are really good.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
This seemingly humorous article also reveals the daily struggles of project managers, representing the current lack of effort in project management work.
Meanwhile, personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional certification) registrations every year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of people who applied for PMP® in China was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 holding valid certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" and that the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn to explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does obtaining a PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners express that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten domains and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they still feel confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process system to support the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on; unclear member division, old hands in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance communication not smooth, and the project difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting brings the online course of "R&D Project Manager Training Camp".
The Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp online course is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D companies, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and fewer investments, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
Not to be taken on face value, let's take a look at what other students have to say about the course: The course is not only taught by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and easy-to-understand explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

On the one hand, this consumer craze makes people marvel at the increasing national consumption power, on the other hand, we have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Elderly people and youth have relatively low financial literacy, and "one elderly and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is far from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to increasing social problems. Financial institutions should take social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jexin has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to promote the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, Jexin has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for the youth group, including college students, and through cooperation with top universities in China, it has launched various forms of innovation practice competitions to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thus accumulate lifetime wealth.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumption and borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When spending, it is important to plan ahead and be mindful of your budget, and make sure to pay back on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour included Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the effort to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
Gulf Arab states resolving differences to restore relations with Qatar is a requirement of unity for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states condemned as unable to solve the Iranian missile issue.
Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations.
Their goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to slowing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the GCC unity and to propose measures for its member states to fully cooperate in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars is the loudest in New Shan District!
This car that our team has brought to you is a dream for many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
With a price tag of nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit and road tax of over ten thousand Ringgit per year, and four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
Well, I don't know either, the data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means while myvi is still at 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h, wow.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google!
Everywhere I go, I'm under the spotlight and everyone is watching me, which is quite uncomfortable (but kind of exciting)!
Fuel cost per kilometer is around RM1 (Car owners don't really care).
Practice the getting on and off the train posture, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will suddenly become deaf after getting off (but it's still awesome).
The body of the car is too big, it will be too narrow to park in an ordinary parking space, I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next to it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road. (This is something I said myself, not related to the car owner, haha)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who would like to take videos of your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!

Just a few minutes before that day, a million dollar Porsche 911 and a ten million dollar Bugatti Chiron were crashed overseas!
Take a look at the results and you'll find that you're right!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News.
The so-called spirit of a university refers to a series of educational philosophies and values that have been accumulated over the course of its development, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious, the global competition in education, technology and talents is intensifying, and higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines", which not only demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country in transitioning from a higher education superpower to a stronger higher education nation, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class in a shorter period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, and realize "overtaking"?
In addition to having a firm goal, path and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand and enhance the image; third, the institutional advantage, making use of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. Each school must take advantage of its strengths while also highlighting its personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of education should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, educational traditions and resource endowments of each school.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to three distinctive aspects in running the school: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment of science and technology integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University-Industry-Research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the university spirit and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Cultivation, Clarity and Pragmatism" and the common expression system of "Incorporating Rivers and Seas, Opening up True and Noble Virtues, Pioneering the People and Building Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", expressing the quality concept of learning from world-renowned universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and development, and breaking the old and establishing the new; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
These spiritual concepts and values are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall Chinese socialist cause, deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the current era of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted, there is hope for an agreement to be reached in Iranian nuclear negotiations - Xinhua News Agency.

As NFTs quickly gained popularity, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplay including NFT, and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project, with a total of more than 3 billion US dollars so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, almost catching up with "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially reported that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single characters. In addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This sense of agency is not granted by the game developer, but rather secured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about my friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway was the choice of industry for investment, namely the selection of investment targets. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good future growth potential, considering the industry's optimal growth state in the next 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the industry development stage, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on for the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Strategy is about "doing the things right", which means doing things correctly.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing", that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on top of increasing customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); on top of increasing customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has welcomed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been recognized as a legal currency by a nation or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of the Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian applicants" in their so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu said that according to the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014, among the three universities, the admission rate of Asian-Americans was the lowest relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also showed that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu told the Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the universities involved in the complaint to take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans.
So far, the three universities involved in the complaints have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education declined to take action on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups involved in the appeal, Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups were also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu consulted with the family of the property owner Mr. Lin about the details of the factory purchase, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the delay of signing the real estate contract.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, Mr. Lu had already paid the deposit and prepared the down payment, but the seller refused to sell at the last step of signing the contract, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing the case, the court found that since the parties had ultimately failed to enter into a formal contract, the blame could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of the double return of the deposit.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind us to exercise necessary caution and attention in the course of transactions.
When signing the contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement on Saturday (December 11th) expressing that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, acting against democracy in the name of democracy, stirring up division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoting "democratic transformation", imposing unilateral sanctions, instigating "color revolutions", and causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale weapon of mass destruction' used by America to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US for its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been voices of questioning both internationally and domestically, such as criticism of the invited leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, with some questioning whether the Biden administration's true intention in organizing the summit was for democracy or for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Schröder also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming increasingly severe. The US democracy is a 'rich man's game' built on a capital base."
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the forces of authoritarian buffering and impact, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has promised to launch a year-long action after the summit on democracy, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send it to the wrong address.
RICHANG Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Ambience: Average [Service Bell] Service: Food served quickly. My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Cake". The Mala Cake is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the cuttlefish is very chewy.
Delicious taste, good meat, warm service.
It's been a while since I last visited Richeng. The fruit lao is still as delicious as ever and the ingredients are of good quality. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time and it was exactly the soft and fluffy southern-style texture I love!
The braised rice was cooked to the perfect degree of dryness and the portion was very generous. The signature wax paper chicken wings were as good as ever, the soup was also good, and the kale was also handled well.
The taste is great, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
Ri Chang Old Store was a popular spot many years ago, located in the Dongdan Building with wooden flooring.
We always have to wait a long time to eat the claypot rice, and the claypot is cracked...
It's been several years since I last visited Ri Chang. The rise of various small shops serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to have a seat available when you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the staple food is great.
RiChang Delivery.
The dishes for this meal were a bit disappointing.
Three Cup Chicken: There was a bit too much side dish and a bit too little chicken.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the undertones of saltiness are not enough, which highlights the sweetness. You can imagine sweet plus various spices as a side dish...
What is the drinking method for Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you would be wasting its rich flavor.
So how do you drink Red Label Whiskey?
The Editor will give everyone a brief introduction.
How to Drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The taste is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoked malt flavor.
This beverage can be enjoyed either on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whisky has entered the Chinese market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky mixed with cola, sprite, or Fanta has become a timelessly fashionable drink.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding them to drinks can dilute the alcoholic taste and change the taste.
Red whiskey + sliced lemon + rock sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Vermouth has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, while lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to individual taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. You can try them as a reference. Hopefully, this introduction can help everyone.
Education Thinking: How to Make University Exams Fair for Both "Academic Elite" and "Academic Underachievers" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In college campuses, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are single-type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass an exam with a last-minute burst of intense study, and if they use other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "underachievers" can pass the exams without much effort and even get high scores; "overachievers" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores in exams, create a "strange situation".
It appears that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflection on the problems in university exams is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, those who have been to university know that cramming, trying various ways to "obtain" exam questions from teachers, striving to define the scope of the exam, and seeking "special guidance" before the exam are not uncommon, and even bringing cheat sheets into the exam and begging for leniency from the teacher after the exam are not unheard of.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the qualification of a university exam depends more on the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be divided into more specific areas, and many major courses focus mainly on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a student has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is basically composed of basic theories and common knowledge of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics that was learned 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a priority."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the exam is usually composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate to compose the test paper. The exam marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that it can overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions in the exam, which can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability assessment, and at the same time, innovate the design of question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exams, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will eventually affect the effectiveness of university education.
The school authorities of Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly value the student's suggestion letter and have deployed a rectification plan across the school.
It is required that teaching units organize teachers to carry out discussions and course final exams for self-inspection, formulate test paper composition and related regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of test paper composition and review links, refine grade assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single types of questions and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examinations need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the real effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the student learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both sides, teachers and students will be better connected and form positive interaction. Examinations will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both academic elites and academic underachievers to get what they deserve.
If it is not possible to change the branch location for me, can it be changed to delivery instead?

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nam-jang Store) currently has no branches.
Before the photoshoot, we had to change the time twice due to our poor time management, but Lanlan, the consultant, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first time putting on makeup properly, wow~ I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The outdoor shoot was taken at Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel cold. During the shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and if there was something slightly wrong, they would immediately help us fix it.
Photographers are also very humorous, and they feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were selecting photos, there was really no intention to add any photos, just the 24 in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't quite right, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
When I flipped through the photos my sister took before and compared them, I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin's studio for wedding photography!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful for your sincere wishes and wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of the special anti-counterfeiting paper stock, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since the beginning of October, with a cumulative total of 3200 people affected.
However, the bureau director, Kalu Amunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will receive their certificates when the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the issue of Sabah Newspaper's newsprint printing problem that had been reported for up to 10 months by an online media.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah Paper is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Kalu Amunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The agency will send personnel to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week, and immediately return to Sabah for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicants in two working days (December 20).
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to pick up the birth registration form."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 copies of the birth certificate so far this year.
They had been waiting since more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost here?
I'm referring to food.
I waited across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Middle School in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd of the month, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission will organize unified examinations for middle school admissions of special talent students.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of specialty students admissions, making the competition for specialty students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students who have special abilities in sports, arts, and technology and have applied online are eligible to take the special admissions examination.
To facilitate students to take the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement from last year, setting 1-2 examination sites in each school district, totaling 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and the examination period is divided by hour. The students will enter the examination points in different examination areas and take the examination according to the time period.
On May 23rd, the District Education Enrollment and Examination Center announced the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes?
Food not received.
The key is that I haven't had dinner tonight.
If it can't be delivered, please let us know earlier.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel leaving the land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate, and personnel arriving at the land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
Officials from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and exchanges between the two sides are frequent.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, transforming from one line of defense against the spread of the pandemic to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the control points forward and compress the risk of pandemic spread, achieving the maximum effect of pandemic control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent days, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported from overseas outbreaks through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate timely local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formal nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, establishing an epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight defense line against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the work of people's livelihood security, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the cities referred to include the counties, cities, and municipalities where the open land, water, and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Rarity.
Vintage clothing items inevitably have minor flaws, so if you decide to buy vintage products, you should be mentally prepared for this.

Xinhua News uncovers the truth of the US military's bloody slaughter over the past 20 years through YouTube videos.
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube titled "Killing Machines" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the past 20 years of bloodshed and killing of the innocent.
The abuse of drone strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and establishes killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, US forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to apply various cruel punishments and personal humiliation to "suspects".
One after another atrocity committed against humanity has aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more terrorizing".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a business and preservation perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded area to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many factories of milk powder and got in touch with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, without any difference.
So everyone must be wondering: why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or you may ask, why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged products?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think the expensive ones are the good ones.
Some consumers even have this mentality that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different after eating it!
Now I will explain to everyone why hearing aids are expensive, where does the expense come from?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the packaged prices are too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by manufacturers are very low, or even no profits. So how can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in the pricing of their products to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer packaging in boxes rather than bags.
Moreover, you think so many manufacturers have to spend hundreds of millions or even billions of advertising fees every year. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine it.
So with the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as shopping mall promotion personnel, shopping mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, especially earphones, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to gain higher profits, in fact the increase in their raw material costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Additionally, some brands, in order to promote their products, use any means necessary to connect with doctors in hospitals, having them assist in the product's promotion and earning a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact this practice is to defraud consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and store it in a can at home, which can save money while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Don't assume that the shelf life of tinned products is longer than that of bagged products. If the shelf life of tinned and bagged products is the same after opening, it just means that bagged products are not easy to store and are prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food delivery was late and the food was cold, which made it dry and hard, so it was completely inedible.
And the soup also spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the things #PRS_ORG# sent must have gone cold.

Don't let others intimidate you at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often finds success studies books in high demand.
Nowadays, many success books promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, we have skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either do your best with all your might, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay in the same place.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you must make a firm determination, start anew, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is undoubtedly a self-deception and a futile effort to shout "you need to change" in the ear of someone who adheres to the rules, follows the old, and refuses to change.
Most people are timid in front of the word "transformation", reluctant to move forward and unable to make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best-case principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limits of ordinary people, leaving most people "sighing at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way to enable more ordinary people to take the path to relative success.
The core of the "Second Best Principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In conclusion, it is always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold drastically lowered, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner of success for all, but in reality it only motivates a few; whereas the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive human hunting and the deteriorating environment of the naked carp breeding water area, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the protection efforts are continuously increasing through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, and the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan Region is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the desertification in the west from spreading eastward.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I need to put everything in, as it's cold outside.
Can I ask if takeout is packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was lost in transit or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just read an article about PMS and it was too long.
Here's a bit of education for the uninformed males.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly on one day between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around age 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of good health, it will come once a month in a regular manner.
But it's not regular enough to make an accurate prediction, so it's necessary to prepare in advance with a tolerance of about a week. Sometimes bad luck can also cause it to come earlier than expected.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; menstrual cramps can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
When menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding for 24 hours from start to finish, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton strips to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the menstrual cramps start won't be of much help.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release, diarrhea is likely to occur.
If it's around the time of your period and you have unexplained abdominal pain, your period should usually arrive within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, which is 42 pieces in 7 days a month. If you add the prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Sanitary pads do not need to be changed often; it is enough to change them once every five or six hours, at most eight hours.
Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual period can make you more irritable, and the emotional instability during ovulation due to hormone changes can be quite unfortunate, making it difficult for your body to keep up.
But the official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Bleeding is not just blood, it also includes shedding of the uterine lining.
After menstruation ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month it builds a house (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If the guests don't come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; for decades, it involves bleeding for a few days every month, as well as abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother has had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty and shameful, so everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a female body for bearing life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, sisters should try sanitary cotton swabs, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending the wrong gifts is quite disappointing.
Order an extra meal for the kids.
We hope that the store will check the products even in the midst of their busy work.
Does the foot bath basin feel numb when taking a foot bath due to electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good effect on foot massage and health care. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question and hope it will be helpful to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan. Foot baths are available in a variety of styles, giving consumers a great deal of choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking your feet in electrified water is really too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up unexpectedly. To his surprise, Mr. Li found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
He found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the long-standing foot bath basin in terms of the highest temperature setting, which population it is suitable for, and what materials guarantee safety.
Generally, foot baths do not have any electrical charge issues, but there is a possibility that some products may not have been strictly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a detachable foot bath basin.
Separating water and electricity poses no safety risks.
At the same time, you can take a multimeter to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily reported on December 10th (Reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held this morning at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: The source of Hunan Red is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum for the "Five-Colored Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, the main tea-producing area promoting tea tourism integration, driving increased income for the majority of tea farmers.
The tide turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea industry experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan Red".
At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called “Bingli Chun” and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General Wang Zun of the Provincial Tea Association said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
Newhua Red Tea adds a touch of red, infusing it with the connotations of tea culture, with its popularity and trading booming, the Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, as there is no place to park below, he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called Tao, the below is called instrument" in the "Book of Changes • Transmission of the Upper Classics", translated by Japanese Inoue Tetsujirō (Meiji era).
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical basis of this concept is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any assumptions about God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.

Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into Metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and Normative Ethics (evaluating various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior people should adhere to, applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theories, but by investigating the actual moral agents' real choices that have been made and observed, and all the moral factors that have led to these choices. It studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as Medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic ethical thought, represented by people such as Valery and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvinism.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empirical Ethics, representative figures: Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, representative figures: Li Kaer, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transition Period Ethics (Irrationalist Ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian aid they have given us over the past 30 years since our relatives passed away, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It was your acts of charity that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the coronavirus pandemic is spreading globally and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease humanitarian donations to our suffering group - the Tiananmen Mothers. This humanitarian aid activity should have been concluded long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Federation of Chinese Student Societies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the Tiananmen Mothers to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphans Education Fund, which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all June Fourth Orphans had graduated from university, MCDF then established the June Fourth Poor Elderly Special Needy Households Relief Fund and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from campuses and society on June 4th, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donation was for the consideration of the donors, who are mostly retired people with incomes not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to his friends.
We will respect the decisions of the refugees and terminate the program within two years, and resume it immediately if needed.
We express our gratitude and respect to those brave and generous comrades who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Thank you very much for choosing our product. Before using our chip, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
After opening the box, please check if the goods are complete.
If there is any missing item, please contact customer service promptly.
The top cover of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that will cause a chemical reaction with PC.
Do not use a syringe pump to directly inject samples into the chip, otherwise leakage may occur.
Commonly, microfluidic chips are tested with pure water under 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure before shipment.
The glass-based chips are also tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) prior to shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using the glass-based chips, otherwise the base will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution during use and do not exceed this range, otherwise leakage may occur.
For a standard base microfluidic chip, we suggest setting the flow rate to below 150ul/min when using pure water for injection, and the oil phase flow rate to below 50ul/min.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample liquid comprehensively and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channels of the general-purpose chip in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be used for long-term repeated use.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, no exchange or refund will be provided.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand higher pressure or flow rate, please contact customer service for customization.

[Effect] Photo Effect: I took two sets of clothes and the overall effect was quite good, I particularly like this set of pictures~
[Service] Service Details: Because I was pregnant and felt a bit uncomfortable during makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the feedback, Rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going forward, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I highly recommend it to all my friends!
From reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
Makeup artists are very meticulous and can match the makeup suitable for you according to your style. They also use top brands of cosmetics.
Mr. Tian Liang needs no introduction, photography is quite a specialty.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague took some photos in Beijing, and after looking at the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I specially searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, which is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the naturally wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-rounded team.
When the photos came out, we and the people around us couldn't stop praising them.
I have already recommended my best friend, and she was equally delighted after seeing the photos.
I hope such studios won't be buried and more people can discover them, take pictures in their own style instead of being generic.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to complete the task as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
Sweet and caring assistants, and lively and cheerful photography teachers, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting and an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for your comments, Xiao Yu. It's fate that we have met. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust between us has spanned thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you. I hope to have the chance to come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
Firstly, it is important to look at the teaching staff of the institution, as if the staff is not strong enough, the training institution will not be of much use. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong staff.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, I'm not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation. Learning this subject is closely related to one's own situation.
For example, your profession, age, language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will be related to the field you are studying or want to pursue.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one has a high learning cost, two requires a lot of time, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can afford to pay certain learning costs and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my views. As I don't know your situation, what I said before is only a brief introduction and not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it all on the app.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) services for wall-mounted water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional seamstress, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me their approval, striving hard for life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, follow me if you like it, thank those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, while we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. The road can be looked back, but cannot be walked back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services has done it for you to the best of our ability, serving your beloved home.
Ensure cleanliness to the family, set a benchmark for housekeeping, provide timely service, and cleanliness to the home.
My daily work includes cleaning both indoors and outdoors.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and lose their luster. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. The same is true for life.
Success comes from doing things with care, and craftsmanship is achieved through meticulousness. We take our sewing seriously.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is trustworthy. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to find a job in any industry right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day starts with the morning, and all the beauty begins from the dawn. I hope you start the new day with joy, luck, health and all the best. Have a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something to possess and be happy about; when we grew up, happiness became a goal to reach and be happy about; when we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, to be understood and be happy about.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: good physical health and good mental health, live life to the fullest until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face the challenge head-on, the problem will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi curators are joining forces to host the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is jointly curated by Saudi Arabia's Diriyah Biennial Foundation and China's UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, with UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art's Director Fei Yu as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennial is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly acclaimed, some of whom used recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain Series" (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Daryl Yeo, CEO of the Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this Biennial could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia that is booming, and to strengthen mutual interaction.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the Biennial is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to be integrated into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered an axe and a shovel.

I want to find out the reason.
The bones can be packaged and delivered separately by the restaurant.
However, the system is not very convenient, so another one is used.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continuously help the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare positions to help promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the poor to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of personnel recruited for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of post development and setting up, the new regulations clearly stipulate that posts should be set up in accordance with the principles of "set up posts on demand, assign personnel to posts, dynamic management, overall control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and arrangement for on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts. The regulations also stipulate that the development departments of each rural public welfare post should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for personnel stationed in rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can I cancel my order?
I am placing an order again.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right-wing has had successful times in history, they have not lasted long. Therefore, they are short-lived, shining brightly when given a bit of sunshine and sweating when given a bit of water; they can reach great heights when successful, but suffer greatly when met with setbacks.
However, realistically speaking, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his statements and also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes seriously the social issues in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, a mixture of political groups, and foreign powers taking advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, to change or improve China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of the situation through political opportunism are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
The Left is actually a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with each other while refuting each other's opinions, and they were quite passionate. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both unreasonable and there is no point in trying to argue.
Don't try to prove that we are right either, and don't even think about getting opponents and skeptics to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the traitors insult you for five cents, when the left-wingers call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or they pursue their ideals but become obsessed.
Gradually drifting away from the ideal, even the dragon-slaying youth eventually became an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom, and due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese history and culture, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing in China emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, and focuses more on equity and security.
Now the overall society hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is definitely left-leaning, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even if you don't understand, just give it a like and you're done.
No more words, that's just how loyal and righteous Flower is.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to US-affiliated companies.
The United States has been suppressing the Chinese chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and decreased production capacity of chip manufacturing companies, thus causing a shortage and chaos in the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are severely affected.
In order to gain control of "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights, restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, either hosting the "Chip Summit" or inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a Semiconductor Alliance and subsidizing US local technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old US technology giant Intel invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip outsourcing business to the outside world.
While most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and could very likely snatch away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer fabrication plant, Zhang Zhongmou spoke without hesitation: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful of Intel's foray into the semiconductor industry because he still remembered the grudges between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been monopolized by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the Integrated Device Manufacturing (IDM) model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to afford the huge costs of setting up a production line.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business to the single process of wafer fabrication, providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to secure capital support, Zhang had approached Intel for investment, but Intel, upon hearing that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, evidently had a high opinion of itself and looked down on TSMC, decisively rejecting any investment in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
It is unexpected that the giants who looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services in the past now have to start doing semiconductor contract manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang feels Intel's entry into semiconductor fabrication is ironic.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally cannot remain stagnant.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to overtake the competition.
I'm not waiting anymore.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some of the strangest trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Selecting three hot topics randomly: February 2nd Dragon Raising, Haoliyu Price Increase, and the Hualala Incident, public opinion spread and formed a peak, then [index decreased] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small hump will appear again.
They look no different from the "Online Sentiment Evolution Model" previously displayed on the Cyberspace Administration of China's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of "solitary peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff".
【Peak-shaped】 refers to artificially heating up quickly to rush into the hot search list and attract public attention; 【Sawtooth-shaped】 refers to periodic heating up to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff-shaped】 refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to take on new tasks and rush to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen in one spot: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, are responsible for popular science, incite war, divert attention, influence cognition, mislead judgment, stir emotions, and influence decisions. Black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black PR will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, let's dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12th. According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron strain.
Mauritania reported its first two cases of Omicron strain infection on the 10th.
According to Kailash Jagutpal, the Minister of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30th after contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons have turned negative and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they all have mild symptoms, they did not need to be hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Kumbuzo Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three cases of infection.

DaMei360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No. 156, Huan Cheng Nan Road
At first it was introduced by a friend, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of frauds.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they hadn't even gone to measure the house. They were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000, and they only showed me a general look at their materials without telling me what brand they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will pressure you to pay a deposit (which you can never get back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated. In a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 RMB did not include plumbing and electrical renovation, nor any doors, cabinets, or bathroom, which are the major expenses for basic installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced, with a specialized team to deal with me.
No matter what, we will bite the bullet and take responsibility for the customer's issue, even if they are not at fault.
They shift the blame around and there are many details that are too painful to mention. In short, don't choose them because my friend's house they renovated was of poor quality and they charged various fees afterwards.
Damn it, they are the same scammers who used to be the leader in decoration, now they changed their name to Da Mei, and it seems like they closed down again and changed to something else.
Therefore, don't choose such a shady renovation company.
When making a choice in the future, it is important to do some research and consult with people, as renovation is not a small expense.

Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then. If the money isn't refunded within 5 to 10 days, legal action will be taken.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

Stargazers, get ready! The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th. - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Anjiu, an astronomy enthusiast from Beijing, photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the Geminids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move at a slower speed, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
Recommended index chart for the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini Meteor Shower left a deep impression with its "falling stars", but this year's Gemini Meteor Shower will be interfered by the moonlight, so the spectacle will be discounted a bit.
On the fourteenth day of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast in the suburbs or rural areas, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it visually.
Note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Photographers who enjoy photography should choose a wide angle and large aperture lens to capture stunning shots of a meteor shower. When shooting, use a high ISO and the largest aperture.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter release cables are also essential for stability and continuity.
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TVs are mostly between 55 and 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of Laser TVs have been increasing globally, and they account for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to ZhongyiKang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for its success in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The SESI Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data has proven that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and can even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
In the current era of increasing emphasis on visual health, Laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short-focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, with little space needed and a small, compact host, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, top-brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat output and less equipment loss, televisions also have a longer lifespan.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a false demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audiovisual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the optimal optical design.
To shield some ambient light, using a microstructured Fieller screen is expensive; the price of an 80-inch screen is basically enough to exchange for a 65-inch LCD.
Additionally, I especially hate when projector manufacturers use diffuse reflection being good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes still can't see it. Even if you take LCD TVs seriously, it is also diffuse "direct" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it won't be able to form an image at all.
What was overlooked was the hot spot (light spot) effect of high gain screens, when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that's when it really becomes uncomfortable.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, specializing in quality products, currently has no branches.
After adding her on WeChat, the lady sent me the available time slots and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
When I arrived that day, I had a brief conversation with the staff about my ideas. She patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with, and finally decided to start the makeup and styling. Before the photographer started shooting, he would arrange some props and guide the action, and he was also very meticulous about the details.
But maybe because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should still look nice 🙊🙊
After taking good photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and discuss the post-production style, which feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the piece, just wait and see the result.
I won the photography-themed feast for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He feels a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
The Visual Arts Photography Gallery selects quality stores for photography aesthetics.
Let's check out Queenie too now that we're on the homepage!
First fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store, then choose the clothes, wedding dresses are also available. They were quite patient when I tried on three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I spent a long time on makeup and the service attitude was also good. Later, they will teach you how to pose for the photography. The only downside is that the photos look like my face is too big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received it in three or four days, and it didn't seem to be much different from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside is a photography studio.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the poses.
If not satisfied, the photographer will also proactively suggest a reshoot.
【Experience】The styling may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made to look like triple eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows was also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily no-eyebrow makeup.
The photos were taken ten days ago, but the photoshopped results were not satisfactory, and the double eyelids were still quite obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried on two dresses. After looking back and forth, I chose the black dress. The saleswoman said this dress was more of a classic, retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The effect was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites for retouching. The photographer said he would have the finished product within 15 days and I am very satisfied with the outcome.
I haven't received a reply for 3 days... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the PRS Organization Plus Monthly Plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for each payment.
I now have to pay for shipping every time.
Can I be exempted first and you collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is this okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance broker company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In summary, these three requirements are quite stringent, requiring strength, approval from the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, with both the claimant and the insurer being Hetai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode, the products of Internet platforms have a higher cost-effectiveness than those of traditional offline channels, due to the absence of operating expenses and salaries of business personnel. Moreover, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, which can reduce the burden of policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professionalism of the insurance agent, this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can apply for insurance themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have also worked as an insurance phone salesperson at Tencent Weibao (similar to Xiaoyusan, an internet insurance broker platform), responsibly informing everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but it's people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, free to get 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they won't tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the following months need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers don't know what they bought after deducting the fee for one or two years.
It's like getting 600 million from an insurance company for just one dollar (the world is full of surprises).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning SMS is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - free coverage of 60,000 for critical illness is short-term. If there is no other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 won't be enough to solve the problem and life will start to become bare.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the mis-selling of internet insurance.
Therefore, in summary, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salespeople.
It is suggested that the topic starter should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, with more opportunities and products for customers to choose from. Some of their products also have better cost-performance ratios than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before underwriting, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During underwriting, I will compare and contrast three companies for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results. After underwriting, I will arrange and custody the policy for customers, so that they can be worry-free.
Grow together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
During this process, neither the policyholder nor the insurance advisor needs to sign anything, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although purchasing internet insurance lacks the "ceremony" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telemarketing" assembly line job, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we buy insurance and consider whether the intermediary we choose is an insurance intermediary person who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us even after many years?

No problem, no need to arrange for a resend, I have already purchased another one, don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we put aside political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me a friend request on Facebook, then posting sarcastic posts, to when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed. I...just let it go.
Later, I received even more messages from friends about your Facebook account, with a picture of you and comments containing sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After my report was uploaded to the news, you didn't show any restraint, instead you became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
Yes, you can continue with this sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are only caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your plan or continue to make all offensive comments.
That's right, I can't, and I have no ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need you to comment on.
I don't even think any woman would be willing to let others humiliate her in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me if I was doing okay.
I said yes, but you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's still okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those without even basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of people.
I have excerpted some of the comments for everyone to consider.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the posts you have made yourself.
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Ruan Mengxiong stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the novel coronavirus, the number and revenues of Vietnam's digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has cultivated a large number of digital products, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms and take on the task of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared their mobilization and gathering of social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, and put forward breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery.
When delivering his speech at the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services all citizens, so it is necessary to mobilize all citizens to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and businesses.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation should embody the national spirit, with internal forces as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation should drive deep development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help green transformation and develop green energy.

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Water-Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Fuling, Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second Water-Green Comprehensive Service Zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the one in Luzhou, Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service zone is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capabilities have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the Maritime Green Comprehensive Service Zone is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for ships and sailors, helping them to solve the "urgent distress" problem.

Latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, on January 9th, a satellite detected the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform is expected to deploy the USS Carl Vinson to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier onboard transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Abraham Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the USS Spruance missile destroyer and the USS Stockdale missile frigate, among others.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) The US Third Carrier Strike Group is assembling around China, with the strongest weapon making a rare visit to Guam on January 17, 2022, with the US Navy's CMV-22B aircraft on board.
According to CNN on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception)
The Ohio-class submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, arrived at the Guam Naval Base last Saturday (January 15th).
The US has assembled three aircraft carriers around China, with the rare visit of the most powerful weapon to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US has sent its three aircraft carriers to the vicinity of China, the strongest weapon rarely seen visiting Guam. In recent years, China has been building a large number of military facilities in the Paracel Islands.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Raging Thunder" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomers" the "most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad", which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located on US soil, as well as B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop of META and the evaporation of 251 billion US dollars in market value, Zuckerberg responded that they are facing unprecedented competition. What is the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest Ad Network, many Apps are connected to Meta's Ads, and it is through Meta's Ad Platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's privacy policy adjustments, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of ad delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow apps to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google takes another stab, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has approximately hundreds of employees in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies looking to expand into overseas markets often find that Metas are an unavoidable advertising channel, with most of the money spent going to Metas.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, yet Meta has made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Agencies across the country are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The era of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just declining revenues, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets not only focus on revenue, but more importantly on future expectations.
Clearly, the expectations for Meta were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current popularity and its annual revenue of 10 to 20 billion US dollars, Facebook is actually feeling a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies, it does not have any good security walls.
Although his several social apps have a relatively high daily active users and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Attempting to reach the unattainable concept of the universe in a short period of time is completely hopeless, which is why Facebook is so dangerous. This is also why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new paths. However, I think his choice of paths was wrong and it was a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.
