Karate vs Jujutsu
Who would be stronger if they fought with the same height and weight?
Jujutsu
Generally, Karate only practices Kata with each other to fight.
Jujutsu, especially Brazilian Jujutsu, involves practicing with a combination of techniques such as dealing with strikes.

That's why I don't feel like watching television anymore...
Is it because the comedians are too much? TV is all about comedians.
Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
It's creepy when a popular comedian forces laughter even though it's obviously not funny, like "you have to laugh at everything I say because I'm a popular comedian".
But if the staff don't laugh, it'll ruin the comedian's mood, and it won't be a pleasant work relationship.
It's like the old black companies, that industry is kind of like an athletic club, and some celebrities have such huge egos that they take on a really unpleasant attitude, so they probably have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of geinin (entertainers) who emphasize the difficulty of their work and say "Don't belittle geinin".
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but I don't like to be told every time that being a comedian is a difficult job and that I'm standing at the top of the apex.
It only sounds like justification for one's own career beautification and for comedians having too high a standing in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the things related to the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining.
I felt like it wouldn't be good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my consent.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse, but the wired version of the mouse arrived and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
Rather than talking about DIY PCs, it's an online shopping trouble, but I can't agree no matter how I think about it, so I'll write it here since it's a well-known place.
I discovered that the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday, was selling an MSI Wireless Gaming Mouse for 3,280 yen (Linked to Fish Taku).
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Kotobuki link), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order mail was received normally and the shipping mail arrived the next day.
In both of these emails and in the purchase history of my page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the lack of communication or cancellation notifications from the order to the shipment, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
The problem started when we received an email a few hours after shipment saying there was a registration error with the product.
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the Wired Mouse.
Reject receiving and full cancellation.
Return only the mouse for a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose the corresponding response.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note all stated wireless version.
Isn't it cruel to demand that we return the item without any understanding that it was different from what we purchased and expect a refund?
In the end, I want to counterattack somehow if I have to accept a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside was washed away due to the typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Matsumoto Yoshiro from Kochi-gahara-chiku, Yamaki-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The Typhoon in East Japan in 2019 had a big impact on the lives of three households with eight people.
Matsumoto Kōro: "At first it was like 'Seriously?'"
"I couldn't believe it was destroyed so quickly. I felt like it was going to be swept away," said one resident. The only road connecting the Kochi-gahara District, the Kochi-gahara Bridge, was swept away by a typhoon in Eastern Japan, leaving 11 households and 30 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut-off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which was usually not open to the public, to transport necessary supplies.
Matsumoto Kōro said, "Usually I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry something and walk across the iron bridge, so I felt the convenience of having a car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge was completed a month later, but it was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, leaving the area isolated again for a few days until a makeshift bridge was put in place.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Matsumoto Kōro: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"I thought it would be best to make sure we have enough food for two to three days," We stocked up on canned food and cup noodles, which can be used as emergency food, about three times more than before the disaster.
Misa Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, and you never know when a disaster will strike you, so I felt again that it's better to prepare a little bit. On the other hand, Yazu-cho experienced an "unexpected disaster" when the bridge was washed away.
To not forget the lesson, the town started its own initiatives in 2021.
Tatsuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Department of Yamatsuri Town: "We have established October 12th as Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day and have announced it so that we can think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience the Paralympics in Virtual Reality (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
Tokyo held an event on December 12, 2021, where participants could run a digitally recreated course of the Paralympic marathon.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, treadmills and road bikes were provided, and people who visited the venue put on special equipment and ran on a virtual space recreated with a Paralympic marathon course.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, an avatar of oneself appears and it is set up so that one can experience competing with participants from both inside and outside the country while running a marathon course. Furthermore, one can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the metropolitan area.
The participants said, "The scenery was incredibly different and so much fun!"
"Running through streets of Tokyo like this is tough, but it's really fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure people can enjoy it in places like sports gyms in the future," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Be careful when purchasing second-hand housing!
"The Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established Building Condition Survey system has been favorable for used housing transactions.
Both detached houses and apartments have seen an increase in price, and the renovation market is also expanding.
With the coronavirus pandemic leading to an increase in people wanting to stay at home, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large scale", and "tower", which have become more expensive. This has also had an effect on the sharp decrease in relatively cheaper newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the market share of existing (used) housing in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Law in part, and started a building condition survey for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used houses, called an inspection (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is knowledgeable in housing checks the current state including the deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property inspection before the sale and purchase transaction, which can give the buyer a sense of security.
This can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyers, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the second-hand housing they plan to purchase and purchase with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the leadership of the building condition survey is mainly on the seller's side.
In addition, it should be noted that only notification of the Inspection system was made mandatory.
In other words, real estate businesses in charge of intermediation have the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking overseas, similar systems have already been established in countries such as America and England, where the used market is thriving. There is a risk of concern with seller-led inspections.
Before the sale of a house, there is a system in which the buyer requests a building survey from a specialist called an Inspector or Building Surveyor.
For example, in the case of America, depending on the state, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home transactions.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the "seller"-oriented one.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, and to sell it as high and as quickly as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey contents and thinking of having proper repairs done so they can live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the objectives and intentions of both sides.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the system of Japan.
The scope of the seller-led inspection mandated by the government is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can also be called a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection with favoritism, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller, will be conducted.

It was quite difficult.
Mentally, I had recovered, so I was full of motivation.
Because my body wasn't used to it and I had a research job, I was falling asleep during work.
Since it was the second time in a year, I thought of taking a break for a month and saying goodbye to the shitty company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it dragged on for a long time.
Anyway, it is important to go to a psychiatrist and properly take care of it, as well as to keep a medical history (extremely important).
If you have a medical history, even if you self-initiate your resignation, the doctor's judgement at the employment insurance office can change it to a company-initiated resignation, making it much easier to receive unemployment insurance and other benefits.
Even if it's hard to find work, or if you want to take a break, you can have enough in your pocket and in your heart.

Here we introduce you to some interesting Ginza tidbits that you'll want to share with someone.
Let's go up to Ginza!
First dive into Kanzo
When walking around Ginza, you can find many traces of its history, such as unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As we were walking around Ginza, the sudden silence was broken by her saying, "You know, this used to be a peninsula."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The symbol of the bustling city that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, Ginza in Tokyo Chuo District.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a silver mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shin-Ryogoku," but when it moved to Kabuki-cho it became known by its nickname "Ginza."
Incidentally, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, an inlet called Iri-kawa extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called Edo-mae-shima stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and advanced the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed districts and had canals dug in order to promote water transport.
Then, the soil that was excavated from the moat and the Kanda-yama mountain that was cut down were used to fill in the inlet.
Why not take a look around the area in front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) where there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza City Office, if you are interested?
The "pilgrimage" to Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a pilgrimage known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za.
At the O-sha standing at the right end of the Kabuki-za, there are few people who come to pay their respects before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, Ryukō Fudōson is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and Ginza Dejichizōson is located on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi at Ginza Terrace.
The Hōtō Inari Shrine and Azuma Inari Shrine, as well as the Toyoiwana Inari Shrine, are located deep in the alley and are not very noticeable, but the Toyoiwana Inari Shrine is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The Seikō Inari Shrine located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachō Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
The Inari Shrine, where foxes greet you at the entrance of the Shaden, was built with great enthusiasm in places where there are many farmers, in order to benefit from the abundance of the five grains that are harvested well.
This eventually led to the belief that large cities like Kyoto and Edo would benefit from prosperous business, and even in Japan's most bustling district, Ginza, faith began to spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist's office because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front teeth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve has been removed and the hole remains open.
He said it was to relieve the pain quickly.
Before treatment, I experience severe pain when I touch my tooth, will it be cured in a few days...?
Painkillers don't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.

Because of Corona, it became fun to stay at home and drink a lot of alcohol without meeting anyone.
The superplay video of the retro game I made at the end of the year and uploaded on New Year's Day was played five times (things are going well in the industry).
While jogging on New Year's Day, I was fiddling with the settings of a smartphone app in the park at night when a security guard approached me (a conversation on New Year's Day).

A male corpse was discovered in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby noticed a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidami, Moriyama District and reported it to the police at 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he had died at the scene.
The police are quickly confirming the identity and investigating the cause of death.
Meanwhile, a 70-year-old man was found lying in the Sunagawa River in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
Although the men's clothing was not disheveled, it appears that a bicycle had fallen nearby.
The police are quickly confirming the identity and investigating the situation at the time.
Regarding the grant payment for households exempt from residential tax in mid-February, will it be paid if there is one person exempt from the tax in the household?

Korean Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
On the 12th, Poseidon International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia, as well as an investment agreement towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, with the remaining procedures such as the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Senex Energy and the approval of the local entity.
This acquisition is the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case since Poseco International was integrated into the Poseco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hankook Energy decided to invest 49.9%.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the energy transition era, and that the blue hydrogen based on natural gas and green hydrogen will divide the hydrogen market, and decided to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Poseco International will secure a natural gas reserve of 802Bcf, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Could the pain in your knee be osteoarthritis of the knee?
Treatment (Medical DOC) Varies Depending on the Cause - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been having persistent knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attack.
Among them, the most common one for Japanese people is osteoarthritis.
Editorial Department: Does that mean the joint is deforming?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Besides the knee, it can also occur in joints of the fingers, base, neck, waist, thumb of the foot, and hip joint.
However, the most common case is in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where the two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the joint is surrounded by a "joint capsule".
Editorial Department: So it has a complex structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called the synovial membrane, which produces synovial fluid.
This joint fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the movement of the knee smoother, which is why.
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, right?
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can deform the joint and cause inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
Although I usually wear basic pajamas, when my pajamas are in the wash I'll sleep in a tracksuit or something!
Are there both people who can quit smoking and heavy smokers?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy, but they quit completely.
He said he was thinking of stopping somewhat, and ended up actually stopping.

Three Gambling & Games from the Kaiji Series that You Can Experience for Real (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Kaiji series of gambling manga, boasting explosive popularity among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where life is at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tremble ... ... Challenge the iron girder crossing!
So this time, I'd like to examine the Kaiji game that can be actually played or implemented in a planning video.
The pachinko "Numa" featured in the gambling-themed manga "Kaiji" is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaizi was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was equipped with large traps such as the "Forest of Nails", "Moving Objects", and the "Three-Tier Crucible", making it almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and, in the end, resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to cause the ground to sink and tilt, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held by the wealthy as a pastime, Kaiji and other debtors were made to participate in a human horse racing event, the iron beam crossing.
The debtor carefully navigates the thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing for speed.
Twelve people participated, and the top two could win the prize, but there were only four iron beams and the safety measures were inadequate, so the possibility of death was quite high.
Although this steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, it can be experienced very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge is a steel bridge that extends to a point 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and beyond it are the Sky Bungee and Victory Bridge, which can be reached by walking.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Korara Kojiro became a topic of conversation when he released a video on his own YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, saying it was an experience that could be had in Japan.
■E-Card is a two-player battle card game.
Play with 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, divided into Emperor side and Slave side.
This game is very well made, with the Emperor being strong to the Citizens, the Citizens being strong to the Slaves, and the Slaves being strong to the Emperor.
In the drama, Kaiji faces Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ears cut off.
After a long and hard battle, Kaiji finally realized that his mind was being read by an ear-destroying device similar to an earphone attached to his ear, which sensed and transmitted changes in pulse and body temperature. In order to win, he shaved his ears to the extreme and caused abnormal values in the Riken River, thus causing chaos.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and other stores.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him competing with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, using an E-Card, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why don't you try to feel the worldview through the game?
A gentle push towards the new year, Tori no Daiema at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
At the Kenkoku Shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive horse of the Chinese zodiac for next year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The same shrine has been requesting original drawings of ema from Geikou University students since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese painting course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Takeshi Suehara, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22) was selected.
The large votive tablet has a width of 3.3 meters and a center height of approximately 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya-san said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping in his tracks, the tiger gazing at the cherry blossoms held a wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, one can still have the luxury of celebrating the beauty of nature".
Tsuchiya-san's designs are also featured on the emas that are distributed to the public.
Gonnnegi's Chiba Kenichi (44) said, "I think I can be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano, a place we want to keep living in" - A workshop for four high school students in the city to make proposals: San-deji Digital, Yamaguchi Shimbun.
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Students representatives from the four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai-zukuri Center", the voices of the youth will be compiled and proposed to the mayor.
"What makes something enjoyable?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison, such as "when having a lot of people get excited" and "when playing the drums".
The first time was held at Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns with a sense of purpose" while moving around "islands" with predetermined themes using the World Cafe method.
Write down each idea on Post-it notes and organize them by sticking them on mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting to live in a town with many young people." "Livability is impossible without transportation such as trains and buses."
Let's discuss further to see if there are any common points.
"I used to think Tamano was boring, but being able to go cycling by the sea is attractive," said an 18-year-old student from Tamano Commercial High School.
The 18 third-year students of Binan High School discussed with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have so much nature around," and they seemed to have noticed not only the issues of the area but also its charm.
In the second meeting of December, only high school students will gather to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the Mayor and Education Director to make an announcement in February next year.
The director of the Tourei Center said, "We hope to foster the love of hometown among high school students, and to provide them with an opportunity to actively participate in the development of the town."

How to Find the New Way to Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
In winter, a scarf is indispensable, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the trick.
I was hoping for a stole that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, and then I found something innovative.
The stole from the brand COTTORI has a long side of approximately one meter, giving it a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought "Can it really be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if the fabric was cut into long strips and woven together, creating a net-like pattern overall.
The eye of the net is designed to allow the edge of the stool to pass through.
Therefore, you can wind and fasten it without connecting the ends.
Light and warm with a fleece material.
This year, vests without sleeves are popular, but many people will combine them with a stole to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have a stole like this.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting!
Get Buck is the one directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like an authentic, life-sized The Beatles, and it's so fresh...
Even though it's right before the dissolution, it's not the dramatic tension I was imagining.
While trying his best to keep things in order, Paul with his annoying "I know I'm a pain, but come on!" attitude, George with his "But, you know..." grumbling, John who was always late but not very enthusiastic about it, and Ringo who was more of a peacekeeper and just sat there with a troubled face...
Although they didn't hate each other enough to quarrel, there was a very common feeling of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had the same kind of feeling, like a legendary breakdown or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is overflowing with talent.
It's amazing how a simple phrase can turn into a famous song as we go back and forth asking each other "how about this?"
Especially the moment when the Get Buck is finished is amazing.
The scene where a subtle humming gradually turns into a zing zing and the lyrics come in is recorded perfectly, it's amazing.
It's rare to be able to see the process of composition in this way, so it's amazing.
Of course, everyone is greased up so just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
So far it seems like only one episode out of three has been released, but from what I've seen so far, it seems like the biggest cause of the dissolution of The Beatles was the surrounding environment rather than the band itself.
Despite all their complaints, the four of them seemed to enjoy making music, but when it came to finding a place to perform live, the producer and promoter-like people would start talking in a way like "The Beatles are the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that the band members had no control over the situation.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it may be that what Peter Jackson felt is coming out...
I thought that maybe Paul being the supervisor is why there are so many scenes where Paul seems like a villain.

How strong is the guts of Berserk compared to Demon Slayer?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't get used to it.
Do not name the technique before performing it.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you must have felt a sense of responsibility and it has taken away your peace of mind.
I think it's a bit difficult to live right now.
I used to be in a sales job, but I got so sick that I had to change jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I felt that I was really suited to sales activities that customers need, so I chose a job in a different industry and it has been much easier to work.
I was asked about things I was unable to do, but I think if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, even if it's just a little bit, it will make my life going forward a bit easier.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest to gain peace of mind before considering this.
I think there is also daily life, so if there is a company union, an industrial doctor, or a consultation window, it may be good to consult there as there may be some system.
It would be great if we could live with an easier feeling from now on.

Tornadoes have caused major damage in America due to the influence of unseasonably warm weather and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred frequently in the Southern United States.
It appears that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this time of year had an effect on the atmosphere, making it very unstable and causing cumulonimbus clouds to develop rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on both Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air below -30℃ near 5500m in the sky, which had been in this record-breaking warmth, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The Southern United States is an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warnings issued in the winter season reached nearly 150 in one day, a record-breaking number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusts on Friday alone, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that the strength of the tornado was measured by the EF Scale (Modified Fujita Scale), reaching EF3, which is the third strongest out of the six levels, with gusts of wind reaching around 70m/s in an instant.
Future surveys may determine that it is an EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, to suit the condition of Japanese buildings.
This JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, has a sufficient possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

Yonezaki "the largest in history" is asking for help from under the rubble in a live broadcast (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the US, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
It was reported by US CNN TV, among others.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can."
He explained that the extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of deaths will exceed 100.
【Photo】Residents carry furniture and other household items from damaged homes in Kentucky, which was affected by tornadoes. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
As for the range of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that caused damage to Missouri and other places in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) and was the largest scale.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered great damage, the candle factory, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas season, also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 employees were working, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
Trapped under a pile of rubble about 1.5 meters thick in the darkness, the woman felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In the live broadcast that was released, in addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, it is believed that the singing of "Happy Birthday To You" was heard, with another woman crying in an attempt to disguise her fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people compared it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like an earthquake erupting," he recalled.
The police officer from the Mayfield City Police Department said, "We will continue the search until it is no longer necessary."
He continued his desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, part of the warehouse of the major online retailer Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of being separated from its carriages, and highways have been closed one after another due to the effects of car overturns.
According to US media, approximately 400,000 households in Tennessee, including 130,000, are without power.
I have low platelets.
What should I do to increase it?

Avoid coarsely cut raw vegetables.

I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be great if there were inns or resort jobs that offer live-in positions, as it would provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
The argument is that while foreign countries deduct points from a five-star rating system, Japan adds or deducts points from a three-star rating system as a neutral point.
At the benchmark point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings of "there are elements that need to be deducted" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we set five stars as the standard, then "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest level" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since it is actually operated in such a system, I understand why you want them not to give three stars (negative reviews).
Therefore, trying to refute those who advocate this kind of rhetoric with a two-choice evaluation on Steam will not fit the conversation.

The Making of a Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the frequency I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right?
Here's the main point, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" offers "fresh fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box with "offshore seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce".
Hakobune is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes with plenty of vegetables.
"We opened last August so that people can experience the restaurant atmosphere even at home," said Kazuyuki Kagami (39) and Yumi (38) couple.
One of the popular bento box menu items is "Fried seasonal fish and shrimp from the offshore with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the good things of the moment at the market.
"As Mr. Kiyoshi said, the shrimp fry is lightly coated with fresh breadcrumbs so that the texture of the ingredients can be directly understood."
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are purchased from homemade fields nearby and direct sales stores within the prefecture.
The side dish may vary depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyo has studied French cuisine, and dishes such as rape and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, they have a fusion of Japanese and Western cuisine that a wide range of generations can enjoy, such as the familiar and comforting taste of dashi-maki tamago.
The bento box "Ground Beef Hand-Kneaded Hamburgers" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling Charcuterie Sets, which are processed meats to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it does shake occasionally (not enough to make you feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's safe because the speed was reduced when there were people around, and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze of others is painful, being seen itself is good but being seen with the feeling of "being a nuisance" is painful to the heart.
The overall review was not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were more people or if they were asked to move to the edge with consideration.
Specifically, I think it would be good to create dedicated lanes so that they don't interfere with people walking.
I thought it would be a great vehicle if there were fewer people, because I could relax and take my time to enjoy the scenery.
It was a vehicle that gave me a sense of the near future, wondering if this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings, which is difficult for those who are not very patient.
It was so embarrassing.

It may be a bit hard to tell, but this eel rice bowl doesn't have any eel in it.
Actually, it's "!Nasu!" (Tap to reveal the correct answer)!
I like eel, but I thought that everyone just eats it with sauce and that the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly... but then I realized that the texture and quantity of the eel is actually important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just felt like eating eel.
The recipe used: Eggplant “Unagi" - Woks of Life (with chili pepper instead of scallions).
I just fried the steamed one in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.

On the 12th, an attempted murder occurred in Saga City Otsu, where one man was slashed and escaped on a motorcycle.
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Daizai 1-chōme, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him in connection with an attempted murder.
According to Minami Police Station, there was an emergency call of "fighting" from a passerby.
The man sustained an injury of approximately 10 centimeters in length and 1 centimeter in depth on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away was a medium-built skinhead.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the motorcycle.

JBpress - Yahoo! News: The Long Journey of Families Establishing Environmental Protection Activities at China's Border
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant at Find Asia Hong Kong) China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities conducted by the local government, but also support the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna (also known as Yunnan Province) in Southwest China is one of such regions.
My sister, Li Wanda, is currently active as an actress. Xishuangbanna is an area bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai people who share roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through the countries of Southeast Asia, is flowing.
The Seesawanna Tai Autonomous Prefecture (Xishuangbanna Dai) Seesawanna covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Li Min-guo, who is doing environmental protection activities at Seesaw Panna, and we were able to hear about the contents of the activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What kind of thing was the trigger?
Li, our environmental protection activities "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The impetus for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband came to Seesawanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China, as he is from Germany.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China, boasting a wealth of biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish an industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest was carried out.
He was dispatched here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here, I, who was a journalist, married an acquaintance.
Before that, did Mr. Lee have any interest in conservation?
Li, I am from Ceiba Penna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, it was decided to move forward with the project and her husband.
Even though they don't have a well-proportioned face or an unusually tall stature, why do you think some people have an aura about them?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that can be forced out.
When you have confidence in yourself, it comes out naturally.
That person must have a strong confidence in their inner self.
High-performance and high-quality rubber boots are handmade by craftsmen.

I was just wondering, is it too detailed to compliment someone's outfit or say that the colors look good?
Isn't it a bit too vague?
I can see it though.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I've never been told to praise in such detail, so I'm not quite sure what it means.
What about praising in detail?
What would you do if Yokomine Sakura confessed to you?
"My heart is blooming with joy after Sakura-san's confession. I accept, let's start dating!"
And, to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one at a later time?

Furthermore, since there are no fees, we recommend opening a NISA Account so that you can use it whenever you want.

【Personal Note / Omakan Environment】It took about one and a half months to identify the cause of CTD in the MOD self-environment.
Until March, the data was stable, but due to lack of time to play around Golden Week, multiple factors caused a Crash to Desktop, and it took a long time to identify the issue since we could only investigate a little bit during the holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to the .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
Main Timing of CTD
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins of the logging type.
* When some NPCs are killed/attacked repeatedly: Activation even with console kill → Improvement with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree's SE updated re-release version) OFF. * Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
* To improve the basic camera work when activating a kill move against some NPCs, the kill move setting for PCs can be turned off via .ini. Is there a conflict in the settings related to DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
* (Basic outdoor) Field movement + partial magic (e.g. Icebound Rune) activation, when NPC is hit: Use Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application setting (top right of MCM) with all OFF and 5 consecutive attempts to improve everything.
Could this be caused by a shader setting misconfiguration of additional armor or body mesh worn by some actors/NPCs? Also, the default.ini of SPID 2.0 has a formatting mistake, but as a result, the NPC should have the intended Perk applied.
Initially, we focused heavily on checking for wet clothing related to targeted attacks and OnHit motions/combat MODs (.dlls), and this was the result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there happened to be anyone facing the same CTD issue in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be useful as a memorandum, so I posted it here.
Everyone is on the brink of mental exhaustion.
Nobody around notices it, not even my colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, Wow, that person looks like they're having a hard time, but they're still working hard.
He is probably on the brink of mental exhaustion.
I haven't retired on the grounds of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before retirement.
Thinking about the importance of Psychiatric Home Visiting Nursing- after Today's Home Visiting Nursing is finished.
I have been receiving home nursing for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have built a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, the home nursing today made me realize how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illness, in addition to the necessary medication management such as packaging.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences and gender theory, or something like that, and we laughed.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, why she got divorced, and if it's okay to talk about such things with home nursing.
Occasionally, I also cross-dress.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that an occupational therapist comes to the visiting nursing station but is given orders in a condescending manner, such as "This is a medical facility, after all."
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really great because they face me on an equal level and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she's a beautiful person (laughs).
There are those who are receiving psychiatric home care, and those who are considering receiving it.
Home nursing can be very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to terminate the contract from my side because it just didn't work out.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents are one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a roadmap for a hydrogen economy.
It was stated that by 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be in circulation (cumulative) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 600 won (approx. 577 yen) per 1 kilo.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The target for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilo is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap is significantly below the target value.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Economic Organizations (Zenkeiren) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), the membrane by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of hydrogen technology patents of the six countries (China, United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the world hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are lower in the competing countries."
The order of patent rankings by country is China, United States, European Union, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.

Was the ratio of female wives from Meiji to Showa much lower compared to now?
I think there were a lot of elder sister-in-laws.
The phrase "older sister-in-law wife" has become commonplace.
Therefore, it seems that there were more older wives in the Meiji and Showa eras than now, as it was said back then that "even if you wear a golden sandal, search for a wife one year older than you."

It is lawful.

For example, it is considered lawful for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its scarcity value, and its value has increased compared to the list price.

Is Parliament on Sunday?
In Takasu, where parliamentary reform is underway, the "correspondence book" of the members of the Diet is also being created in a TV program-like flyer: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Takasu Town Council is undertaking unique council reforms, such as creating an eye-catching flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The aim of the town council election is to get the townspeople to take an interest in it by having three consecutive terms without voting.
To spread the word about the Sunday Assembly taking place on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Asa Kara Nama Gyron", "Tetsuko no Heya", "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Tantei Series" ... .
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had catchy wording reminiscent of a popular TV show.
Hyoue Katayama (43), the Member of Parliament who created it, said, "I want you to come to the Diet with a smile on your face."

US weapons and ammunition have arrived in Ukraine to assist, and troops are also engaged in training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News.
(CNN) US State Department officials reported that, based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine by 12th.
Military aid is equivalent to a total of 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of howitzers will be transported to Ukraine after the start of the new year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile Javelin.
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defensive capabilities, such as the increase in forces carried out by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is on high alert over the movements of the Russian military, and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate a response plan in case Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons aid when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House on September 1st this year.
Military aid from the United States to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula, the total aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, in accordance with a multinational joint training program for Ukraine support, state troops from Florida State were dispatched.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US European Special Operations Forces have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of US Special Forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with President Putin of Russia on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also indicated that it will impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the "review" of the inheritance and gift tax that would make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand" is directly targeted at Amano Akira, the former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking with your family during the New Year's holidays!"
This is the technique of lifetime gift and rushing inheritance.
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year, which was a concern, but there is a high possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
We will impart everything from the basics of gift and inheritance for a timely and advantageous rush gift that will make it in time for the end of the year, along with a direct hit to the former Tax Commission Chairman and Liberal Democratic Party Member of the House of Representatives, Abe.
(Keiichiro Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
From wealthy people to company employees in urban areas, lifetime gifts are seen as a "forbidden hand" and "from the perspective of taxing them in an integrated manner with inheritance tax and gift tax, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer".
The ruling party's announcement of the 2021 fiscal year tax reform outline last year caused a great disturbance among not only the wealthy but also the middle class.
This is because what it is trying to say is that by changing the inheritance rules and prohibiting lifetime gifts, which are the main inheritance tax countermeasures, it is aiming to increase inheritance tax significantly.
The ironclad rule for tax reduction measures for inheritance tax with a high progressive rate is to reduce the taxable assets.
Lifetime gifts, which are the strongest trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in one of the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integrating Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax" has arisen.
Although the 22nd Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was of concern for the fastest introduction, was not adopted, the policy towards integration was re-established with more detailed wording such as "review the current Inheritance Taxation System and Calendar Year Gift Tax System" and "the non-taxation measures of Gift Tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
In an interview with the editorial department, former chairman of the LDP's Tax System Research Council and former Secretary-General Abe Shinzo said.
It is most important to ensure that the tax burden remains the same regardless of when the asset transfer is made, without losing any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from unification. If the amendment is passed quickly, there will be three chances left for lifetime gifts.
Even without that, it seems likely that in the near future, a big step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax avoidance measure.
So, how do the rules of Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax change specifically?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcasted on terrestrial television starting January 10th, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD Original Drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】Kanade Yamaya as the heroine role. This work is based on the same-named manga by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, and is a heartbreakingly pure love love story of a man and a woman carrying the past.
The protagonist, Kaori, is voiced by Furukawa, and the heroine, Rise, is voiced by Yamatani Kanon.
College student Rise meets her senior at her part-time job, Kairi.
Kairi, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder for some reason.
Rise is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but could it be that Kairi is a murderer?
Yudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
For those who have not yet seen FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I hope you can gain a deeper understanding of the work by watching Kairi and Rise's complex psychological depictions, their conflicts, and their changes.
We are happy if original fans can also enjoy it.
Look forward to it!

The players of the team that won the NFL game with three passes, what did they feel and how (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw a pass to the Patriots only three times.
This was the fewest number of passes since 1974 Week 3 when the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in the NFL over the past 50 years.
In 1974, the Bills had an unprecedented genius running back, O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to exceed 2000 yards in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the combination of Simpson and another RB, Jim Brown.
The biggest reason why the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18m blowing fiercely, and it was snowing before the game.
The Bills, being local, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
Pass 30 times, run 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no intercept and it was certainly not incompetent.
There were four red zone penetrations in the ten offense series, and there was a scoring opportunity.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three attempts, they only managed to score one field goal for three points.
Goal-line defense in the final minutes of the game.
The Bulls, chasing four points, committed a penalty at 3rd&9, making it 3rd&14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
On 3rd&14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He then threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs was running a shallow cross to the right side and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering the Bills' WR Cole Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw two passes aiming for the end zone.
The 4th Down pass may have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a Touchdown on the 3rd Down.
You need to get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if they had gone for 4th & Short, Allen's ability to make a run of his own should have come alive.

It's time to get rid of and replace the items that tend to stay in the kitchen for a long time. Here are three selections from Harper's BAZAAR (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News.
Sponge
Even if you replace it frequently, it is probably the sponge that is not replaced as often as recommended.
Research in 2017 has shown that even if kitchen sponges are disinfected in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (although it is still recommended to disinfect them in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends exchanging the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when a cutting board begins to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, which is why bacteria can proliferate.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Wipe with clean water and air dry or lightly pat with clean paper towels to dry off the water.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked.
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug cup, but the cracked surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cutting lips with the missing part or spilling beverages.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but after saving the settings and restarting, the screen turned black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed without blinking.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to take about 5 minutes to finish, but it won't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be that the USB memory is too old or using an SD card with an adapter.

I don't think I've ever dreamed of having an unpleasant feeling with a moderate probability.
I was living overseas for a while, and when Japanese people went out, including me, we didn't like the Confucian etiquette of superiors and inferiors, and there were quite a few people there, so I think we misunderstood that we could say anything to the locals.
If it looks like Westerners, I think they do it without any malice, more like a kind of spoiling or a friendly attitude.
My friends from the West I call by their first names, but when I'm speaking Japanese I sometimes get a bit confused about which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's just friends.
It's probably just ordinary behavior, but if you overlook it, it might lead to an exceptional treatment of him as a gaijin, so it's better to say something now before it's too late.
Can you talk to me according to the rules of Japan since it is Japan?
Incidentally, my white friends who naturalize always raise their glasses higher than the younger people when they toast at parties.
Without a doubt, I'm conscious of it, but if I do it like that, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are so attentive to small details (including myself) that it's annoying.

Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
I opened Reddit today and saw that the newly created subreddit had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm very happy.
Thank you everyone for subscribing!
Actually, yesterday the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason today 25 people subscribed, so I'm really grateful.
People who subscribed to this subscription today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could tell us in the comment section where you found out about this subscription! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Currently, there is only one person creating threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.
Even without thread creation, it would be encouraging if you could leave comments, etc.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
If you're using Twitter, please start a thread!

Since I only have a limited understanding of English, I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of the sentence structure, but I understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I'm just saying this based on how I feel, so it might be a good idea to ask other people too).
It is common to see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it is a small-scale company, I feel that it is well translated.
I think that for people who are not Japanese natives, it is a matter of whether they can reach an understanding of the subtle nuances of Japanese even after long-term study.
I don't know how high of a level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uneasiness, then it might be better to look for someone else.

It is said that in Demon Slayer, training is the battle.
"Effort Equivalent Exchange" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku-hen" Start Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
One of the things that makes the manga Demon Slayer stand out among recent shonen manga is the abundance of training.
Generally speaking, it is conventional wisdom that training arcs, where there is no battle and the protagonist trains day and night, are not popular with readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that, even in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated for two years of training, only the touching parts were drawn and the rest was skipped over in a grand manner.
Well, one of the charms of wandering the land is its eccentricity, but there are times when "staying in the same place and training" doesn't go well together.
So, the training of Tanjiro, the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", began with him kneeling before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begging for Nezuko's life, who had tried to take his own life, to which Giyu said, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are only forced down by the strong with power... ... .
While saying that, it was Giyou's kindness to introduce the "trainer" Rin Takanokojima, who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps (even though he is not good at communicating his intentions).
Tanjiro's first contact with RinTaki was when he was asked "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" and RinTaki immediately judged him for taking too long to answer.
Among the fans, there is an unreasonable exchange of rumors.
However, walking with a sister who became a demon carries the possibility that a moment will come when a decision is forced upon them.
It can be said that initiation is the beginning of the training process.
RinTakiyama then said to Tanjiro, an inexperienced novice, to take him to Kamimistu Mountain and to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is filled with pitfalls, catapults, and traps, and it seems like death awaits before even beginning the training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he was able to detect the faint smell of a trap set by a person, and somehow managed to avoid it, barely making it a "protagonist correction".
Nevertheless, it is the essence of Kimetsu that allows Tanjiro to say "But I can't suddenly become so powerful that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is only being able to use the power and skills that have been honed before to their full potential.
Those who put in effort will be rewarded accordingly, while those who do not put in effort will not be rewarded. The "Law of Equivalent Exchange" is a humanistic praise that is different from the supernatural power of the Oni, and is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work.
Is this old?
I still sleep on the floor with a mattress, futon, and duvet, instead of a bed.
Because it's not an apartment, it's a house.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room more widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Is it annoying?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time, but have to work multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In this case, I don't think it's appropriate to be stubborn.
I think of it as a gambit, where we try to get a greater benefit than the minimal effort we put in.

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Division" integrating home appliances and mobile, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of its Consumer Electronics and Information Technology divisions into a single set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name the division Device eXperience (DX) and will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the intention is to strengthen user experience through various services ranging from mobile to electronics.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that the newly established DX Division, which was formed by integrating the CE and IM divisions, consists of business units such as Visual Display, Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, Mobile eXperience, and Networks.
Samsung Electronics officials explained that the name change reflects mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and the strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, the company emphasized its intention to enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect customer needs, not only for products such as televisions, electronics, smartphones, and communication equipment.
The strategy of creating synergistic effects across the entire company and building a foundation for differentiated products and services by surpassing the boundaries between organizations was also reflected in the name with the establishment of the integrated leadership system.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, in recent years, the notation of BCE has been increasing based on the idea that it should be used.
BCE stands for Before Common Era (BCE).

Although there are matters of preference, I don't think that the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I would like it to be expressed in a heavier and stiffer way.
They lie in wait, their jaws primed and only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
Hanmio larvae wait in the sand to ambush their prey at any time, only exposing their circular head from the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
The mantis larvae lie in wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about is
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Are we looking at it from an ant's perspective?
I wonder?
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular head" would make the part "a giant beast wearing a helmet in ant scale" disappear, don't you think...
24 vehicles collided in Aichi, and the trailer driver had no pre-existing condition; was it due to carelessness (TV Asahi (ANN) - Yahoo! News)?
In the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, where 24 cars collided, it has been found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution had no chronic illness and that some kind of carelessness was likely the cause of the accident.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), the suspect who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the initial collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him for prosecution on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer driven by the Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura Suspect had no pre-existing condition and it appears that some carelessness was the cause.
The police are conducting a house search of the relevant parties to investigate the situation in detail at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semifinals, this new installment is packed with new gimmicks as it focuses on only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review Submitter Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started before the match!
In short, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it is important to note that it is not just a volume that depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, arm-wrestling competitions and special training scenes, which are quite different from what we had before, don't necessarily lead to the match, but it's not boring at all.
As the tension of the century war gradually intensifies, the feeling of the story is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly amazing that even this period was calculated in the direction.
And before the important finals, there is one more mountain that cannot be overlooked, the 3rd place deciding battle between Terriman and Ramenman.
Besides the luxuriousness of the match card, what I like is before the match, in the backstage, Ramenman shouting towards the Kinnikuman poster, "It's my turn to be the one to aim now!!"
Trying to chop it.
However, Terriman, who happened to pass by, accepted the hand sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with a silent stare and the two parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is a lot of controversy surrounding Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of the distant future and what I can do in it!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a mangaka, still feel deeply even now!
Although the fight between the two did not last long, the highlight of the scene was Ramen Man's appeal of tears after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of fate directed at Kinnikuman!"
It's such a phrase.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers of Kinnikuman have been feeling that the protagonist somehow wins in places other than through his ability.
But by making Ramen Man say this, Boiled Egg Teacher had already stabbed the dagger in, saying that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one phrase, readers are thinking, "Wait, does Kinnikuman defeat Robin with his strength?"
How?
It will surely stimulate our imagination with its unpredictable development, and from a writer's perspective, this is like a line of dialogue where Yudetamago Sensei, the creator of the work, has imposed a restriction on himself.
Wow, this is an amazing thing.
I'm sure this volume is one of the big points.

Winter Illumination Weekend to be Held at Aoba Mountain in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Takahama-chūyama, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The Winter Illumination, which started on November 26th, is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cypress tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture were surprised to find such a place when they came to Fukui after a long time.
She was saying that it was very beautiful and she felt relaxed.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, a Christmas event is planned with a button pot offering and a movie screening.
I think that there are only a few people who can read through the documents in order.

Yonezawa-based Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association will broadcast online delivery and PR of agricultural and livestock products from Yonezawa via Yamagata Shimbun.
On the 11th, the Oki region Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of municipalities and JA, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce," which involves streaming video and selling products online.
Tokyo's Minato Ward, for the first time, planned the "Nationwide Collaboration MINATO (Minato) Market TV" and Yamagata Aizen Bujotai remotely appeared, delivering the charm of the region along with special products.
The "Okitama x Minato Open Port Project", a collaboration between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, was decided to be held, and was broadcasted from the Satoyama Vision House in Yonezawa City Minami-Haranomachi.

This morning was unfortunately...
The power of the PC for NAS has stopped working 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) Upon returning to the room after a while, I noticed a sound like a Pink Rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for now.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6℃).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Do not start up.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will briefly turn on and the fan will start to move but will soon stop.
After that, say nothing.
I tried unplugging the power plug and plugging it back in, but it still only lit up for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and the ATX20 pin and 4 pin, and removing all other parts, the computer still won't start.
5.) I have heard a buzzing sound like something is hitting the fan of the PSU before, so I am suspicious that the PSU might be the cause.
I'll try to find an ATX power supply that I have left over and give it a try.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work...What should I do?
Should I change the case and the motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits within the last 4-5 years?
Where did you see it?
Are you surrounded by nature?
I live in Tohoku.
Our nearby is everywhere.
I'm also in the garden and the company parking lot.

30 more new coronavirus infections in the military...all breakthrough infections = South Korea (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News

She can't do it, is she being discriminated against because of her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that appearance can be determined.
Because the inner self cannot be shown.
What did you do with your school's gym uniform after graduating?
I wear it as casual wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started cohabiting, I was wearing room wear and laughing.
Is it possible for someone to become a Riajuu at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?

Ryūjin Nippon, the Japanese men's volleyball team advances to the Final Six for the first time in 29 years! Coach Nakagawa said, "It was a big goal."

I would like to plant trees in the garden that will act as a screening, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
Ideally, I would like an evergreen tree that is easy to maintain and produces fruit.

Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to stop cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of separation.
It is best to hire a matchmaker, have a betrothal ceremony, go to bridal shops, and have a wedding and reception.
There is no benefit to cohabitation.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played the arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a Legend Rare, but it was a re-recording of a Legend Rare (^_^;)

I think yes.
