The goods cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the goods value....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it's no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction of what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another option for a credit?
I generally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also beneficial for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Quickly look, quickly help, bring the bottle, etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy itself for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours while he's falling asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is also the statement of the psychologist.
For if something were to happen such as a Fire, Burglary, Earthquake, Alien Invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is of course up to your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Crime/Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his predatory cats.
The case is taken on by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation, comes into contact with his Therapist who runs a Clinic where he treats Anxiety Patients.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumped out of the window while another drove to death intentionally.
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there was a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with a fire.
This is the rough plot and I'm fairly certain that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is familiar to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN available.
I have to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail.
The child, four years old, had wood splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) along its entire length.
I tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

After my voucher is no longer leniently extended due to a complaint that did not arrive to me, I will cancel my order worth approximately

What should I do with this number then?
Regarding Omikron: Johnson will drive the refreshing forward.
New Omikron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
Therefore, by New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with coronavirus booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly increasing Omikron figures than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency due to the Omikron variant, so vaccination protection must be urgently reinforced.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's get a boost now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, there was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation for a conversation arrived by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the E-Mail now.
Could someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for approximately.
Not in 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I am unable to help.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something from my soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims don't seek help or think we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never be easier because of that.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series like for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick the Youngster could be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, the tension did not subside after the game - but rather increased after the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball-Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, it was the manner of performance that disappointed.
As an example, one statistic expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) with a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We weren't focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and we didn't implement what we had trained for."
Specifically to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least also due to BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the star players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore contacted you again.
We originally contacted each other half a year ago.
Always perfectly dressed: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had originally planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "at the direction of the authorities" to contain the Coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season have to be cancelled for now, as stated on the singer's website (www.palast-orchester.de), who turns 59 today, and his musicians.
Starting in January, the artists will then make up the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of ballads and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's No Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair combed back strictly and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and this way we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working; I can only see the cover page but can't flip it.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: No new housing is created through expropriation.
The new Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the results of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out further discussions with the FDP in the Ampel Coalition about tightening rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I will redeem it independently with the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
That is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 deaths due to Tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to pass through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On Saturday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through was gone.
Houses, Stores, Government Buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that your Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.
Is it still produced?
Or has it been completely taken out of the range?
Is there a possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
When will they report themselves?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form and submitted a return request and wanted to inquire if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccine premiums and changing advertising slogans.
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The repurposing of ad slogans into vaccine calls, following a German example, is also intended to increase the willingness to get the Corona vaccine.
He switched to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I am taking a Screen-Shot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings with Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Through the Gryphon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The large arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran Lake.
There should be further action developed.
A few miles away from the village, a group of Goblins should ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Persuade, Bargain, Threaten, Recognize danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 armed with Spears, 6 armed with Bows and Sabres.
Unnoticed, the Goblins lurk in a hollow way and flank the Heroes with three Bows each to the left and right of the wagon, while two with Spears stop the wagon.
If the battle comes and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all rendered unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village magistrate, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. Should a defeat be unavoidable, this Half-Elf intervenes with two of his Servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina for Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to the Adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more trust in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then have the receipts sent over so I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

I was just sitting on it.
Here, the lower part, or the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing throughout the season, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the plan due to the delayed start and the start accident, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!)
Apparently, for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, it's foolish, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to its conclusion.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that this possibility was available for Verstappen.
I believe that one should simply know these basic rules if they are commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time puzzling what is now possible or required according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant antics that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter one brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
Both of these channels also make less advertising in their broadcasts than Sky, and that as free-TV channels.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
So, in any case, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'm interested in hearing your opinion.
One #PRS_ORG#-pendant light, brass and multicolored glass.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not gotten anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them had already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am requesting support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire facilities can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple diffusers.
The MK Series has one, two, or four outputs depending on the model, but fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK Series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to a diffuser or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and be mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if ever water were to run backwards, that the water runs out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK Series are pure powerhouses, consuming little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the go, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a few precautions so that no one gets annoyed just because it took a bit longer.
It is so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course, here Corona does not stop.
Please don't rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the courier services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment,...they have it really tough.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without an armrest?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is sending an astronaut daughter and a moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly appointed astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amidst applause from friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers emerged one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who was flown into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission.
He had to work hard during his deployments and make everything himself.
She had just flown along with them, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would most like to return to space again right away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely autonomously.
The capsule detached from the rocket during flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above Earth, experiencing periods of weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-trip from Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain lit in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the Leuchtstein retains a light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the Smart Stone light proves itself year-round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, their light stands out even more - however, it is to be expected that the illumination duration will be shortened as the days become shorter.
Please be aware in winter that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (»AA«) format, which can be easily exchanged if necessary.
You can get a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the usage duration of your decorative light even further.

Someone who has worked or studied Biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind being in the laboratory (I already have my inorganic chemistry practical behind me).
Before I started my studies, I had already researched career prospects, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and will study until I get my PhD.
Currently, I am having doubts, and the career prospects are particularly depressing.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one often hears about great career opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, but on the other hand one often hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in Mal.
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/ What training have you done?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm considering dropping out of college in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer technician.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down.
Extra Stress Before Vacations & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why only now a post is added.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our business.
It seems there are holidays plus bridge days before them as well.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of emails that had to be sent out before Ascension, one order here, one order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time has passed and that can't be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
Then what's the point of having holidays if we can't even enjoy them properly?!
The stress was not from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking cookies with her son and doing some crafting.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the festive days she still has some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth molt and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential Vitamins, Amino Acids, Minerals, Trace Elements, and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping is exclusively due to dietary errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
The DDR Handcrafted Model Old Building E-Locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The Series E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reich Railway Company (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal freight trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager-Antrieb AEG for the delivery of the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
As the reelectrification of the central German network progressed, an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service arose, and in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 which were available in larger quantities were preferred for assembly.
Once it became clear that the processing rate could not be further increased with the E 94, the E 95 came into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Railway Operating Depot Halle P. in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the locomotives aged, the complicated control became increasingly problematic.
So it often happened that triggers got stuck during shifting operations.
Then the fireman who was constantly riding on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the coupler during the ride.
Damage to the driving motors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages with the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most splinter classes, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one man, which would have caused problems in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last to follow them were the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives except for the E 95 02 were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at Halle Main Station as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is museum-maintained at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external painting, where the transformers were checked and five driving motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were rehomed to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted Model H0 in original packaging, functioning well, optical rework of the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-Parts are it.
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't set up the bed.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which unfortunately were produced with errors.
The center beam does not fit into the designated holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent?
No flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I get this sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage.
Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure Euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech District).
According to the reports, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it will come much later.
And I have to pay for shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
He said that the illness of a friend had motivated him to do so.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
On social media, there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
For the past few months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated in order to counter these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family have not been vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
A circulating interview on the internet with Deutsche Welle features Uğur Şahin saying he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization for the vaccination of the vaccine.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in power substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity.
On Friday evening, several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia lost power: no more electricity and in many cases, no more heating.
A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage to a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected inhabitants in several municipalities were left without power due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the county, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
He explained that the repair of the damages will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians could only provisionally put some of the lines back into operation.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work needed there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt power line has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back on.
Since Saturday at 6pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected at 21.30 hours.
Since 11:15 PM, those affected by the outage have had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities called for neighborhood assistance after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station houses if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating backup generators, the residents of nursing homes were particularly in focus.
In addition, according to government reports, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical devices or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
This is the bedspread in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the underframe on the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations of it.
We wanted those with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#.
We got a 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot interlock them and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to return it, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate some feedback.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Could you please send me the return slip via email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
The German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the ski jumping with a big lead into the track.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using Version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it as well.
When I try to open it, the message "Ups!" appears.
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
The chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure a uniform and clean paint job, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you use the brush for the first time with a new paint on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components that will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt container.
The first line on the component.
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers will later provide a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This results in unrealistically appearing surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic tones and colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or decals.
From emblems on aircrafts to ship names and trims and badges on automobile models: Decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the hull.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when sticking is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you just slide the image a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While you hold the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check if the image is properly placed before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick, wrinkle or even tear on your finger.
Wipe up any excess water with a household towel.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and I have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I left off reading.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by Email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at me in 3 separate packages.
Ok, thank you anyway!
Then I will shop elsewhere once the money is back.
Can I get it back problem-free?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to billing the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing.
In order:
We had applied for fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and got the approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, and was billed to the PKV (private health insurance).
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we hadn't yet claimed them with the health insurance.
We applied again for cost coverage with the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first offer expire.
The second wish for the child is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in this round:
Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
Did the PKV have to point out in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants via email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
OK.
We will order nothing more from them.
If you add up the revenues from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You can certainly forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the cabinet arrived completely distressed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clearly stated that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two loyal customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal usage.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cabinet and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# Series.
These products are advertised with stools to be purchased additionally, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A Low-Budget Film or Low-Budget Movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you
Kind regards
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU.
According to policy expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, declared the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of Pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"It apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and taken back to the border, said a spokesperson for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car Phase, when he is said to have illegally overtaken.
A second objection was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last lap, Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car Phase, during which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'm checking it.
I'm speaking with the Bank and will check back in with you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting a SC-Freiburg Fantag.
Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of SC Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the Fan-Community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for beverages and sausage.
The roller coaster trains glowed that day in red and white uniforms.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park, it was again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing happy fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of Originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the Reading Series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your silly chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your error to fix, not all from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This Email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
Kind regards

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an Antisemite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfDler saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions Evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
God set this whole thing in motion because of me.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are a science foe and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion-free and color-free even in the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification ratings.
These specifications only apply to exactly specified conditions, which rarely correspond to usage conditions.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see instruction manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying lenses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When using the optimal conditions - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying instruction manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are selecting the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations during the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 pieces for it.
In doing so, the 56-year-old has already experienced many strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their names therefore.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Issues with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable WiFi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan Module, which transmits the WiFi, no longer the full 500 come, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less comes in (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet with the new fiber connection now on the first floor being even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line when using fiber?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to switch checking accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with Giro accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered the savings account.
Initially, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
This applies not only to new contracts, but also to "individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least, more than 100 banks have, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumer Centers, which in the first instance were granted the right by the Berlin Court of Law against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire Beauty Army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of their appearance.
Nevertheless, Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts still fly to both female and male fans alike.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still searching for true love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame bring happiness.
An Unworthy End to a Career: Räikkönen Must Give Up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight brush with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi not even halfway through the race.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport-Königsklasse.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from pole position, and made it to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte triumphs in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it once, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended against Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, moving from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgadener, driving for Stuttgart, came in second place previously but this time he finished in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with a home victory - podium for Jamanka.
On her home track, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh.
After only managing fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced with pusher Deborah Levi to a world cup victory on Sunday, resulting in a German triple success.
Two-man Bobsleigh Olympic Champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki placed third with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get my first podium position in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit frustrated with the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had already put the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, so I finally inquired about it.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it said it was expired which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare Bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is currently reduced :)
Why will shipping start only on the 16th of March?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it will an extra field appear with the message.
It was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and girls and women,
I have some things that I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for one or the other...
I'm 24, have PTSD, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also sick and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week) which is causing me a lot of distress with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomachache right now, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his snuggly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and some petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have homework coming up, which we of course need to divide.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I am somewhat well treated and getting by.
Not good, but I'm managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me); tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I should at least prepare a bit for the Anatomy class.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room there.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But does it go on further after that?
Only until the Birthday.
Only until vacation start.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues eternally.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this has partly to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the exact color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we swap the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Otherwise, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Completely different topic: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed it.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to keep them separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the Theory of Relativity.
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or such things?
I hope the question isn't too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well.
That's been very long, then I would stay away from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help with film search.
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a movie for youths.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the Realm of the Dead) (not quite sure).
In the real world, there is a young woman, which I cannot describe any closer.
And in the Realm of the Dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Realm of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to gain life for himself.
I believe the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that means something to you, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her belly since Week 1.
Fast Forward is still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's making you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, it always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it rise up from the belly?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that if everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common to put the Kids on the stomach to sleep.
Additionally, we are already a "regular customer" of yours and have already purchased a lot of articles.
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
This is about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To put it clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this Sender is now below all standards.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno said, "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising channel trying to get its BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marahs' Do's & Don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit at the expense of the action with the rented exploded rooms.
How can one find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I request a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling – My Little Warm Friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The Cherry Pit Pillow with Cover is suitable for the following applications exclusively as a heat pad:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, stains, or burn marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for maximum 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, shake the heat evenly throughout the pillow!
Afterwards, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On the first warmings, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but it will disappear with repeated applications.
Make sure to follow the given warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instruction manual.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm pit!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes, or tumor diseases, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and in a way that is inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start despite the power supply being plugged in.
So I took out the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on power supply?
Is something else broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat area is.....
Often on tour and still bringing a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter capacity easily swallows larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever everyday items you need, they remain well organized and separable from the photography equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the update of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design speaks for itself - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: one conventionally through the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the clasp hooks can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower bar.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be securely closed without engaging the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: if you take not only your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and easily store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left backpack half and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your Support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday for confirmation of the commissioning of the
Shipping company has announced contact for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received a message.
I request immediate settlement.
I have now been speaking with the third support staff member, and none of them have been able to do more than promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it possible to predict when the cabinet will be delivered again?
Retaining him is not an option for me...
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help.
I wish you a lovely evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me on.
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And I couldn't have anticipated that last year would have gone differently than expected, and I wasn't able to timely redeem and clarify it.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that is aligned with the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
Tinted windows produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic features of our tuned windows emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a Pioneer, searching for wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other Pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues in order to not go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a blockade!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the announcer moves to a new location, thus changing the available actions.
This will continue until the Anpreiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they will receive lesser rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is given.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child Psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Are Turning Into Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated parenting debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
Us parents and other responsible ones must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation, as is sensible and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.

The Health Ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolishment of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Minister Conference already on Tuesday next week". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
How should I best proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat area is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated my account data.
What could this be lying on?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur approximately 1 in 1000 in frequency.
Most commonly, this results in hearing sounds/voices, less often in seeing images, and most rarely in perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of Awareness, as to protect the child until detachment a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anaesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, however, u/Nitemarex had none by definition.**
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard in the eCommerce field in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We're also losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
One more question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order since I don't know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Why haven't I been called?
I had posed a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at 97 years old.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 years.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my life's gratitude".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins its first MLS Championship.
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1:1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference Final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
For Christmas there was something incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have acquired a taste for it and I would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other Tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens now further?
What is the status of the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I can manage it.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But until today, the money has not come to me.
Could you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a Tube Endstage significantly contributes to the heat and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ Series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows one to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and distortion.
Earlier it was mentioned that with the POWER LEVEL Regulator, you can even create a power reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL Regulator, the full potential of the VT+ Series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX port so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who invest in a VFS5 Footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there then the possibility to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the Commode?
Will we get an update in the next few weeks about the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending more than 1,000 Euros on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Do you have a Premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over the Nuclear Agreement.
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna Talks to revive the Agreement had been resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the state with the highest coronavirus incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a coronavirus incidence above the mark of 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest nationwide incidence, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Furthermore, health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, so I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own costs.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It's time for changes.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the post here?
If one looks at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one can conclude that it is non-existent.
We have entered a state of winter dormancy and extended the summer lull for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely just related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we stand generally.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still really want the Bundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found, simply put, a shambles.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project have a future existence.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed, adjusted, or removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different hanging from you for that.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is quite sad too, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the duvet, is it also available in oversized, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to initiate it now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - you need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How much time would I have to obtain this or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time, I thought that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like vegans are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without them intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan!
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot change the fact that I cannot be on-site due to a funeral.
Could I please be assigned an alternative pickup date.
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available again continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr is prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state.
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new Rescue Vehicle Water Rescue of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Lahnstein Dive Team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a steady increase in activity: The boom of hotel boat travel on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but nothing worked after I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app.
I'm a bit frustrated because this whole action has already taken a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Alright, that's settled then.
I would like to order 3 items from #PRS_ORG#'s collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally speaking, it should be said that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people in uniform and in the armed forces are naturally drawn to the right-wing conservative side, and it is also clear that these people can have difficulty dealing with the reality they live in. In addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migrant background, women, and homosexuals (and I'm not talking about the overly stereotypical feminine gay, because they are rarely to never found in the executive, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't know unless they told you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put their own at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by excessive left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly sets itself for them or thinks it has to do them right, while they just want to be treated normally.
Going back to the right, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there. That these people are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plan any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet and engage in an active exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is a good thing in my opinion, that we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of order.
I'm still dealing with my order that is no longer available.
I had been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros in black, or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part, there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Orderly through a child?
Hello, I've been occupied with one thing for a while (w32).
I am very disciplined and organized at work (independent, very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then and again I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that someone could come to visit spontaneously.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses against work and disinterest.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become neater with your child?
We don't have any yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I don't have much motivation, it doesn't really bother me as long as there is no visitor and there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide a greater incentive or does one remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
An exclusive, new, and high quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends).
With the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System was more than doubled to further increase comfort with the Flex System 2.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and crotch provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panels in the lumbar area increase flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending and mounting and putting on equipment at the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing around the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate hood).
The soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with an adjustable width that can be finely adjusted with a flexible, gentle Velcro closure that does not stick to the lining or seams.
Double cuffs with zipper at arms and ankles connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, coated neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neopren panels bonded flush with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater durability.
Edges of the inner cuffs grooved for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I completed an apprenticeship in software development and have now finished my apprenticeship for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, that means I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a Social Worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time something is objected to in my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my dumb questions"/"he must really think I'm inferior" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it in this place.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment.
What do you mean by return please!
When I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message appears Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the feed in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own protein substances from them again, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather molt in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One heaped tablespoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
For severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this Email?
Statement of a Municipal employee in contradiction to the Statute.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree should be felled on our property.
Also a request for dismissal has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees, including the walnut, is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On one side, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the Constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check it?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb.

Ah okay, got it.
Great, then many thanks again for making it so easy!
Advice and Ideas for Further Career
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the cross-entry as a ref.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that area (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me, so I looked for alternatives that could make it more fun.
Eventually, I ended up in the teaching profession and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now on my third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past I have always decided to continue and at least finish the reference, afterwards I can always switch.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Even though it's vacation now, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my weekend was my weekend off.
I had free time.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that are additionally annoying me.
Generally, it's fun and from an outside perspective, the Ref is running well too, as far as the feedback and such is concerned.
But I'm completely exhausted and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but adequately paid and worked together as a team instead of being a solitary fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if in a year I won't be back at the same place as now and be unsatisfied.
You can tell that everything is kind of chaotic, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as outsiders on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that would be enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix Series from VOX has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We are introducing a brand new Modeling Engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound technology.
Thanks to VET Technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, VTX amplifiers offer an enclosed housing and a bass reflex system from which natural resonances just pour out.
With the Tone Room Software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor Technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the power and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of play dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of every VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner Brothers shone, but it wasn't enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable hook and loop dividers, it is tailored to your photography equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and objectives.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an attachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the West coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data available about previous outbreaks.
Activity from the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are still not making any predictions as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowing.
"The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 houses and other structures, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Two new land tongues of a combined size of about 50 hectares were formed off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of indigenous peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas days closely with gifting.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on Nikolaustag.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold secretly into the windows of three women in one night, in order to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular German custom emerged of filling the boots of children, especially, with presents.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject the veneration of intermediaries between God and people as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such details so seriously, it only annoys a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to Martin's custom with Martin singing and Martin's procession, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from boots at the door to socks under the Christmas tree to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the Day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sled as a Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

I was told that one will be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and the business of a bookmaker with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground stakes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminosity maximum 10 hours.
The durable plastic finish is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that are internally glowing in color.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Glowstone" at any sunny spot during the day.
Two included earth stakes provide a firm hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you decide the color: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The shutdown also occurs automatically when the battery charge level drops to a preset minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle will start over the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher isn't taken into account, then I won't order anymore out of principle.
If you reconsider, then give me notice.
Otherwise, that was our last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, no hardware store was open anyway....

Pill Problem
Hello dear Womenfolk,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I was forced to start taking the Pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that behind, because I already have to take enough medicines due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
Surprisingly, my main problem is not the pain but my skin.
I had gotten an explosion of pimples from 0 to 100 during my last two-year break and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really burdened me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two year pause, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have an appointment with the dermatologist.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Previously, he had severe Neurodermatitis, then a period of peace, then large-scale Knötchenflechte and the Acne Theme.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to chronic illness and have settled on a mix of low-sugar, low-milk, and low-meat diet because nothing else seemed to work properly.
It could also be that something is hormonally wrong, but if you have problems everywhere like me, you don't want to look for what else could be wrong.
I had already given everything to my colleague, semina etc.
I wrote it down and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I had to keep working and answering the telephone in between, and then suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to examine, if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
But is it generally available in large quantities?
since it is available in large black.

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments.
In the courtroom, they are seated in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Schöffen decide with professional judges whether and how long someone goes to jail.
In conversation with the "Oeffentlichen," two of them report on their time at the Bad Kreuznach Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John-F.-Kennedy-Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't access my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have any options to preserve this for so long.
We would use the table as if it were ours, as offered by you.
I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like to have one in gray.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pick-up and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
A 110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pole of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good Morning!
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue Betsellnummer:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the further process is now?
Have a beautiful start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it multiple times yesterday!!
This is a commode made of glass and the entire sides have burst open, thus there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and they are refusing to come into the apartment due to their regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues.
I have been a Ref since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I am currently having a lot of difficulty planning my Geography lessons in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of Geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
I am not very satisfied with the book Terra and most of the task assignments in the book.
Therefore, the worksheets too.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really be pleased.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation concerning the Christmas business.
Most stores are only open to those who have been vaccinated or have recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retail stores.
Stefan Genth, Chief Executive Officer of HDE, criticized that businesses dealing with non-daily needs have suffered from revenue losses.
According to a recent survey by HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Therefore, merchants with 2G access restrictions lost nearly one third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only doing well in the grocery retail and online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The Chief Executive Officer said that shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter.
"Bringing 2G when shopping won't help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required high staffing.
He demanded that the Wristband Regulation be allowed nationally.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
In addition, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G Rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at around 90 percent.
"These numbers are sure to drop in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the Economist.
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G-proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged it and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the Return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the Controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The angle of emission of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Furthermore, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the filmset or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 Controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and an illuminated display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons.
The Memory Controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
This is often already in the possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power through the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
For attachment, you have a 16mm sleeve connection, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using clamps on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and thus designed for longevity and harsh usage.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery package.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery package.
This way, you can easily transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Too bad, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen, who had not won two consecutive games, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga loss.
But then SGE turned it up, scored the frustration of a mixed season start within an hour and won brilliantly with 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to everyone who was involved".
Initially, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations at rank nine.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusener in the lead 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE Trainer.
"When the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game day and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly strong," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one should "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the year-end "at this level".
Next up, as part of the English week, is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) on Wednesday.
I received an email stating that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it redirected, no luck.
Can it be resend directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and reorder the order?
That would unfortunately mean for me that I won't order again because it already took a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball before Quarter-final against Spain
Germany's female handball players slunk off the court with hanging heads and vacant stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged National Coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We simply weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start of the game.
Misses and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB-Team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counter-attack.
This was not the hoped-for ignition.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women were hardly able to make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke soon after saw red due to a hard foul on her opponent.
She can participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the closing phase of the first half did the DHB selection get into the game a bit better and at least come within five goals by halftime.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener-Schützlinge were guilty of all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who counts among the medal contenders in the finals.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

The title suggests it, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in care homes.
Once these are mostly finished, I will then continue on to some of the vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal situation (e.g. "I am taking medication X, will it be compatible with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include providing enlightenment about the vaccine, making an indication (person is eligible for a vaccine according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Order and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have any doctors, but "only" (by no means a lack of appreciation!) pharmacy-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can't (aren't allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I usually carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
A difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What exactly is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused intense contemplation in the Bavarian Broadcasting (BR) television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And nobody who needs everything to go quickly.
What the people heard from the TV presenter was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg communicated the solution, which likely caused astonishment among many Oberpfälzers.
The Huidlerer, the audience learned, is a rag with which someone wipes the stove.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
Noting that this is a typical Oberpfälzisch term, derived somehow from the more well-known Mundartwort "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - likely for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synced and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire selection for road bikes- really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training to prepare for my bicycle tour in the coming week.
Said and done, I took off with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my back tire absolutely refused to go any further on the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
The weather wasn't too bad either, so maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to encounter this problem multiple times.
Now it wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, he had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years on a roller.
But when I think that I have to do a tire change after 80-90kms of driving, then I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I'm not very keen on spending 40€/tire only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I'm wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are Marathon Plus tires available, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD more according to my limited knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO Series would get new offspring.
The new addition is called SOLO 15 and visually resembles the larger models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the home conditions.
By principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but sonically an exceptionally high level should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels nearly unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears notably mature and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone rise in tone.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Turning slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the soundscape can be made warmer.
Thanks to the Point Sound Source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal Stereo Triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a Feindynamik that is unmatched.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO Series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary changes during the building process.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the corresponding location in order to be able to run the cable through it later without any problems.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
Afterwards, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
The back wall, lid, front, and floor will now be glued onto this.
In addition, the three reinforcements should be used and glued.
The bracings themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use pre-made boards from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
Afterwards, all plates of the foot follow, including the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable circular saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection clamp to the back wall.
Afterwards, a router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next, mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is most easily achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
To do this, push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm of it sticking out.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Next, the crossover is prepared and deployed.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Installation Manual Solo 15 Crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone!
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term notice.
BUT: At least three people will be joining via call, so we will be able to follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - yet we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get the beverages ready, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
