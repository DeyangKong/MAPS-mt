At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students sang the main role and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Agency
Washing hands with air, sniffing to diagnose diseases, accurately searching for sources of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of innovative academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensors: your home health checkup doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the Biomedical Engineering College demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a deep breath and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of the breath you exhale."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status on the market usually detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target, and its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: the high-energy eyes of the doctor
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room due to inadequate early detection and removal."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp plates, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate according to the operation needs and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and look cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand-washing device".
As soon as we stand on the apparatus of the washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
"So, we can get our hands clean!"
The colorimetric test and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to replenish it to me as soon as possible, thx.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really suffer from heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, and sudden respiratory arrest, then we only have four minutes of life window, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, how important it is for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
Across the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what the founding father Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, squeezing the person's chest is of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are the only way to save someone.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing sudden situations.
Who knows, it might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. Before I saw on Little Red Book that there was also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The 13 yuan shrimp dumplings, is that just one!?
Never tried
How come #NAME# doesn't make it clear?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# delivered only one shrimp dumpling for me to eat?!
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie, in all senses of the word.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, then it's not bad at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad films. One kind will make you fall asleep in the cinema, and the other kind will make you angry after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly a genius when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creature from a Clix novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you might suspect if there are any metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find it is actually just a pile of crap.
First, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother's wish was to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get the business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
How can the small hoodlums on the island drive a section of the mountain road to a standstill so easily?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck drivers around could not be found.
The prop's feelings are too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and criminal suspicion become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't they call the police when facing usury, and the police in the movie even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key to open the door, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room door for one night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the entire movie, and it is so far-fetched that I feel pain when I recall it.
Worse than the plot is the movie's theme, or rather, that the movie has no theme at all, it is just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it might be an inspirational film, half way through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for young people in a small town to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep self-doubt, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the crap during the big holiday.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the cliches of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town youth who likes to ride a motorcycle and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng acted in, which was burned and still able to sing), we can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't bear to watch.
As for the female protagonist, who obviously is not mentally challenged but behaves like a five-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if it's due to her acting or the director's requirement.
I also can't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to give the audience a headache?

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system, and admission is equivalent to being a qualified employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recorded by pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises be clearly defined. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises shall sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices aged 16 but not yet 18, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific post, teaching content, and rights and interests protection of the apprentices on the job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise jointly design a talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a pilot period for the cultivation of the educational system. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program. The top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated personnel training between schools and enterprises, and effectively improving students' job skills, to improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Omecamivir has strong transmission power but mostly mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization yet.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are already more prone to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta outbreaks, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first reported Omicron Rho variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors had shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the past few weeks had severe conditions, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while the death rate of the early outbreak cases in South Africa was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, and we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only have two weeks to enter this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Deltha still being the main strain of coronavirus in the world, cases of Omikron are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Hauden Province increased by 400%, with tests showing that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Times Commentary: What Can Save Abducted Children?
If we use the famous public welfare slogan "No buying and selling, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for trafficking, group prevention and control, and everyone against trafficking, make trafficking lucrative, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Emergency Release Platform for Children Missing Information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app is "Reunion", I feel a warmth.
The new technology not only has a poetic name of "literature and art", but also is practical and effective when used in information technology.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the human trafficking case is cracked, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Weighing the importance of the matter, under the urgent purpose of “rescue”, topics with many opinions and great controversy such as “whether child trafficking should be punished with death penalty” can be put aside for careful discussion, but the rescue of trafficked children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, human traffickers are used to leaving the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
One minute delay in the abduction action may cause the child to be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case investigation will also increase.
In this situation, taking out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to crack cases and find children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "Crackdown" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to be operated.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at the train station, the parents fell asleep and woke up to find the child gone.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest or placing the child under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police cracking down on trafficking crimes, the buyers of trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
With the trend of "leniency" in sentencing, the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to the category of more serious crimes with a high starting point and a maximum penalty.
Even to this day, there are still many cases of human trafficking occurring every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the "market" of abduction is widely present, traffickers' greed will be aroused and they will constantly innovate abduction means, forming a "contest of law" situation with law enforcement officers, and the anti-trafficking action will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences from three aspects: ideal faith and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leadership and party theory, to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the whole meeting in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the whole conference, the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial party committee to learn, integrate and understand, enhance the ideological, political and action consciousness of "two establishments" and "two maintenance", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishment", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year party history, etc. Yang Haodong answered one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to firmly follow the Party, and to dedicate their youth to writing responsibilities and responsibilities.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the rider's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigable
I hope you understand
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No more, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
Waited for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Taste and flavor are acceptable, acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3% is refined, or known as "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil obtained by dissolution and refining of the residue from oil production.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be known that olives, just like grapes used to make wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, resulting in different standards of olive oil.
The best place for olive growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similarly climatic countries such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. far south of the equator.
Olive harvesting months:
From March to June every year is the time when olive trees blossom and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for harvesting fruits (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded, with Biden declaring that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also expressed that plans to hold the second Global "Democratic Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and policy committee member Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy rights activist Lo Kwun Chung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can face the challenge, as I said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As government leaders, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be better able to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening remarks on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, as well as our democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task."
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat of the (Chinese Communist Party) to our democratic values."
And that is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason we must change."
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan's Administrative Deputy Minister Tang Feng released the "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of resistance against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly on the front line of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used public health and collective interests as an excuse to justify the infringement of human rights, leading to a global regression of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down to win against false information.
On the second day of the “Democratic Summit”, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally #NUMBER#
Well, I won't call then.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely complain.
Why didn't you tell me earlier if you can't deliver it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
We waited for a meal for an hour and a half.

I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a practice court with a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If it can't be distinguished, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. This kind of "entry-level clapper" is actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold up, and it's difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of their existence is-- tennis is so hard, they know you can't learn it, they also know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so they give you a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to me to buy expensive things then, so I can make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly better second-hand racket. Prince or Dunlop can be chosen, as these two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one of 500-600 is good enough, and a second-hand one of 200 is great, isn't it wonderful to enjoy the experience of a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Do I ignore the previous one?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the saliva chicken was raw.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with slightly overweight bodies when it comes to dressing.
Girls with a bigger body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long, the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you divide your outfit into three sections, upper, mid and lower, you will appear to have naturally increased your height. If you choose different colors for the upper body, skirt and long socks, it will create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover your body fat, and noble and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for slightly plump girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of dressing well.
Plump girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with thin grids), choose a soft printed trumpet skirt, and match it with a drape neck top, which can well cover up the shortcomings of the plump girls.
Of course, there are standards for girls with a bit of extra weight when it comes to wearing short skirts.
A chubby girl should choose a top in the same color as the short skirt to make her plump figure look taller.
A mini skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN pairing for summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your best features.
An A-line skirt will be slimming, especially for chubby girls. Choose a tighter top to create a layered look that will be even more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can be tried by chubby MM as well.
Even the slightly overweight girl can dress with a sense of fashion.
As long as the rules of dressing are mastered, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of "micro fat girl" one day earlier 😄

Xinhua All Media + Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Ignites Winter Olympic Passion - Xinhua Net
On December 11th, Beijing Dreaming Team player Pang Yao Tian (middle) shot the ball during the match.
On the same day, the 2021-2022 Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued to compete in major ice rinks in Beijing.
This league is divided into regular season and playoffs, with participants aged from U6 to U18. The groups are divided into competitive and selection groups, attracting nearly 3600 players from 256 representative teams in the city.
The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has developed for more than ten years and has now become a platform for Beijing youth ice hockey enthusiasts to exchange skills and make friends, and to provide excellent players for the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Team and Youth Team.
The league plays a driving role in the Beijing youth ice hockey sports, igniting the enthusiasm for the Winter Olympics, and laying the foundation for the development of Beijing ice hockey sports in the post-Winter Olympics period.
The girl acted as a target for her sister to raise donations: "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News.
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou. The board reads "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' to raise donations for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows that a girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stands in front of a slightly higher wooden board with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" indicating that passersby can use a bow and arrow after payment.
The behavior has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl did such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl on the street was warned for soliciting donations for her "arrow target"
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
The police officers of the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying and asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed money for surgery, please help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Jijiali and was raising donations for her elder sister Jijiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 for treatment, unable to think of a good way to raise funds, this behavior was made.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as the target and the other responsible for the bottom hand, but did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone was watching and taking pictures and posting them on Weibo.
After the police department's security department identification, the bow and arrow used does not belong to the control category.
The responsible person stated, "We do not advocate this kind of fundraising approach to gain public attention."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: Good Thinness: Convenient Appearance material: Satisfactory Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, four exhaust outlets for cooling without any problems, worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is great, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The price of Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is still not expensive.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. Game performance: The game performance is smooth, and most games can be played smoothly. My chicken eating is all high frame rate stable, very smooth, LOL is no longer a problem, CSGO is also easy to handle, most three-a games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is powerful, the work is quite quiet, and the game effect is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance material: Cool and cool appearance, the game's own cool display effect: The screen is clear, playing games 1080 is enough.
Buying a laptop feels really good, mainly for design, cost-effective, lighter than expected, and better looking than expected. The red on the butt is a very nice wine color, not so garish, overall much higher than expected, worth buying, girls are also very suitable.
I started to use the Acer Nitro Knight two years ago and it has a high cost-performance ratio and excellent quality after two years.
I also recommend this product to my friends around me!
We have already purchased three machines in this series!
It has a beautiful appearance and good configuration.
I wanted to wait for the 418 bank activity to buy something for my nephew, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I didn't catch the big bank activity, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back to review after a period of time.
A brand new original, high cost-performance game laptop, with a nice design, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a computer for the kid to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the kid said it can be used without any problem, this computer can do 3D design work with good performance.
He said it was good that I bought it for my son.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't understand just ask, recommend buying.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the hottest in 2021?
No doubt it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can get awards?
Recently, there was a very popular article called "Quick Look! Project Managers Can Compete for the Gold Medal in Olympic Projects". It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more inevitable.
Seemingly a joke article, it also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, behind which is the helplessness of the current project management work.
Meanwhile, personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of people signing up for the PMP (Project Management Professional Certification) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide is nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people is about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing working environment makes us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management and related knowledge points, but when they really do project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to land in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and the project dragging on and on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance communication not smooth, and the project difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base".

Jiexin advocated rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" carnival, the national online payment business transaction amount reached 17.7 trillion yuan, creating a new high compared to previous years.
Various types of discount coupons, eye-catching live broadcast sales, once again let consumers benefit greatly. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people marvel at the increasing strength of national consumption power, on the other hand, we have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behaviors and skills, which require further improvement in basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the youth is relatively low, "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "overindulgence" label attached by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, and thus have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems, financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with quality and considerate service, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, CSC Credit has conducted comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people including college students, and through cooperation with top universities in China, it has launched innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, help them establish rational consumption concepts, plan reasonable consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer loan misunderstanding, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and pay back on time according to one's ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car or buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously help the public to improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of the stay of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies, to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis caused by the embargo imposed on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a total embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the ASEAN, resulting in a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the effort to restore relations with Qatar by appointing a new ambassador to the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolving differences in order to restore relations with Qatar stem from the requirement of unity for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states had condemned for being unable to solve the Iranian missile problem.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the Gulf Union and to propose measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good
It is said to be the loudest supercar exhaust sound in New Mountain District!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago — Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is over ten thousand ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it can go?
I don't know either. Data says that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h. It probably means that while myvi takes time to reach 30 km/h, others have already reached 100 km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it yourself, and the editor has sorted out some explanations that may not be available on Google!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool)
The cost of 1km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice the getting on and off the train posture, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deaf after getting off (but it's still cool).
The body of the car is too big, and it will be too narrow to park in a normal parking space. I'm afraid it will be knocked when the car next door opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road. (This is something I said myself, not related to the driver, haha)
Please do not misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Both Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just minutes before, millions of dollars worth of cars, the 911 and the Chiron, were destroyed overseas!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Resonate the Spirit of the University with the Spirit of the Times - Xinhua News Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated in the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which originated in the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying. Higher education is an important "supply side", and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" not only shows the confidence and determination of China's progress from a country with higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's first-class in a shorter time, accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and achieve the goal of "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing lessons from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school running quality; second, cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shape brand, and enhance image; third, system advantage, making use of the superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint force, optimizing resource allocation, providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate the catching up of the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to be aware that it is impossible for all universities to be the same in building a world-class university. Each school must show its own personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of school running should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school running tradition and resource endowment of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our education: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of science, technology and education, and form an entrepreneurial education ecosystem of the entire chain; second, we emphasize the convergence of disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a system environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang-based production, research and cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, self-cultivation, clarity and practicality", and the common expression system of "embracing rivers and seas, opening up true virtue, opening up the world and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Harboring Rivers and Rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the mentality of "using the world's talents for me", expressing the quality concept of drawing on the world's famous universities to educate people; "Opening True and Thick Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth At the same time, it should also be tempered and tempered by virtue and personality; "Opening the People Before the People" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, research and innovation, and also shows reform and development, and reforming the old and the new; "Tree My Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in the same glory with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
"The wise hear without sound, the wise see without form."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the Chinese socialist cause, deeply grasp the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Guangxi University students can take a maximum of 5 years off for entrepreneurship-Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19th Special Report (Reporter Zhang Ying) Reporters recently learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that in the future, universities in Guangxi will implement flexible education systems, relax the suspension of university students' academic years, and extend the suspension of entrepreneurship for school students by 2 to 5 years on the basis of the original education system. The suspension of entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time.
In order to promote the innovation and entrepreneurship of college students, the departments of education and human resources in Guangxi have worked together to build an entrepreneurship platform and to construct more college student practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases outside the university, providing external protection for college student entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases of each college should be more than 3000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 2000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and give priority to students who perform exceptionally well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to switch majors.
College teachers should go to industry enterprises for at least two months of internship every two years, so as to enhance their awareness and ability in innovative and entrepreneurial education.
The Autonomous Region Education Department requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, striving to make every university student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school period.
Colleges should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.

As NFTs quickly rose to fame, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to gain stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplay including NFT, and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project, with a total of more than 3 billion US dollars so far.
Data from TokenTerminal shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, almost on par with "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, the official of Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
"Axie Infinity" is spreading a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single roles. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of agency is not granted by the game producer, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway was the choice of industry for investment targets. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market scale of at least 1000 billion. Secondly, one should choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry that will reach its optimal state in 3-5 years. Lastly, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the track being flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics lies in "do the things right", that is to do things correctly.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing", that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in terms of increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to extend horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); for example, in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of improving the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been recognized as a legal currency of a nation or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares Company to launch the first Bitcoin ETF in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, which marks the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the US capital market, and the investment in cryptocurrency is further expanded.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian American groups submitted appeals to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which took the lead in initiating the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American famous universities has doubled, but in these three American famous universities, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions process".
Zhao Yu said that according to the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014, among the three universities, the admission rate of Asian relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu told the Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian Americans.
So far, the three universities complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education was not accepted for procedural reasons.
In addition to the Chinese American groups participating in this appeal, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups are also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the family of the house owner, Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin Mou signed as the payee on the "Factory Building Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice; both parties agree to sign the factory building purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contractual terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the delay of the signing of the house purchase and sale contract.
Taking into account that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned 200,000 yuan as a deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry when he had already chosen the house, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment, but the seller refused to sell it at the last minute.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
The court found after hearing that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it could not be solely attributed to the defendant, so it should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer's Reminder] Exercise necessary diligence and attention in the course of the transaction.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to be prudent and pay attention to the obligations, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhou Saturday (December 11) issued a statement saying that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is "drawing a line with ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, pretending to be democratic in name and acting against democracy in reality, inciting division and confrontation, and transferring domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale lethal weapon' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted via video, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning in the international and US domestic communities, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, etc. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden government is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democratic summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, and rich-poor divisions becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital basis.
In his speech, U.S. President Biden stated, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism and the shock of those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must renew it in every generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "in the face of persistent and worrying challenges to global democracy and human rights, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The US side has promised to launch a one-year action plan after the Democratic Summit, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

The braised rice is just the right degree of dryness and the portion is very generous. The signature wax paper chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the kale is also well done.
Tasty, friendly service, good meat.
The old shop of Rich Chang has been a web celebrity for many years, a small building in Dongdan, with wooden floor.
We always have to wait a long time to eat the claypot rice at the entrance, and the claypot has cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Richeng. The rise of various small shops has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to have a seat available when you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Tasty flavor, good meat, great staple food.

So how do you drink Red Label whiskey?
The editor will give a brief introduction for everyone.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whiskey entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + cola or Sprite or Schweppes and other carbonated drinks became a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can bring visual pleasure and add to the drinks to dilute the taste and change the taste.
Red Label Whiskey + Slice Lemon + Rock Sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.

The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. Hope my introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How University Exams Can Benefit Both "Academic Elite" and "Academic Underachievers" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and learning levels, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are single-type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming before the exam. If they try other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "slackers" can pass the exam without much effort and even get high scores; "nerds" never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't score much higher on exams, creating a "strange situation".
It appears that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflection of the problems in university exams is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this level of meaning, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, people who have been to university are clear that it is not uncommon for them to rush to prepare for the exam, try various ways to "get" the questions from the teacher, strive to get the scope of the exam, and get "key guidance" before the exam. Even in the exam, it is not uncommon to sneak in small copies and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of whether a university exam is qualified or not depends more on the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by teachers, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many major courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be tested in university exams.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is basically composed of basic theories and common sense of disciplines. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university study 20 years ago is still being studied and is still the focus."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the exam generally forms a question bank, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate to form the test paper. The exam marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that it can overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But to draw up a set of test questions that meet the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to master the teaching situation comprehensively and analyze the learning level of the students, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of the test questions, which can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the types of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exams, students will have corresponding preparation plans. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out research and course final exam comparison self-examination, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine the score evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an issue that university examination management needs to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the hard work lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. Eating from both ends will make the teaching and learning better connected and form a benign interaction. The examination will also be more in line with reality, so that "scholars" and "dunces" can get what they deserve.
If you can't change the location of the store for me, can you offer delivery instead?

The colleague's order has been delivered.

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Dress Photography (Nanjie Store) currently has no branches yet.
Before taking the photos, because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lan Lan helped us arrange the time patiently.
Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first formal makeup in my life, wow~ I can't believe it, I will look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken at Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day so we didn't feel cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and if there was something slightly wrong they would immediately help us to fix it.
The photographer is also very humorous and feels very happy after taking photos all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, and we just chose the 24 photos in the package directly, without adding any. (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time as me added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, and I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many.)
The photos were fixed today, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't very good, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
I compared the photos my sister took before and I was really satisfied with our photos. It's simple and fresh, which is exactly the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Mrs. Jin for wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborns in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeiting paper stocks, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and a cumulative total of 3200 people have been affected.
However, the bureau director, Kalu Amunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and the anti-counterfeit paper will be reissued when it arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the 10-month long report of a web media pointing to the printing issue of Sabah newspaper.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah News was different from that of other regions, so it could not borrow inventory from other states.
Kalu Amunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then return to Sabah to carry out the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20) to deliver it to the applicant."
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to pick up the birth registration form."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting from more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is that almost here?

Education Information: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Junior High in 2016 - Xinhua News
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Middle School Admission Examination for Special Talents was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, all districts of Beijing have compressed the proportion of enrollment for special talents, making the competition for special talents even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students in the district this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan of the district, and the planned enrollment number is 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students who have special talents in sports, art, and science and who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District will continue the examination arrangement of last year, setting 1-2 examination sites in each school district, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and the examination time is divided into hours. The students will enter the examination points in different examination areas and examination rooms according to the time period for the examination on the same day.
On May 23rd, the District Education Enrollment Examination Center publicized the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the examination results online.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control at port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that personnel leaving the land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) in the near future must have a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel arriving at the land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant personnel of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and both sides of the border are frequently exchanged.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, transforming the single line of defense against the spread of the epidemic into two lines of defense, in order to move the checkpoints forward, reduce the risk of the epidemic spreading, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent times, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as local epidemic situation monitoring and early warning not timely, high-risk personnel closed-loop management not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing merely in form, cold chain items not well disinfected in each link, centralized isolation sites not well managed, and epidemic emergency disposal not scientific and precise.
The notice requires efforts in 9 aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do a scientific and precise job of prevention and control without relaxation, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the potential risks of basic living materials supply and prices, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports of entry cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities where they are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by provinces (autonomous regions, directly-administered cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil Tube Video Uncovers the Truth of US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Slaughter - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro documentary on YouTube called "Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American democracy. For 20 years, they have been poor and warlike, bloodthirsty, and indiscriminately killing innocent people, committing various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to launch airstrikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature and forming killing squads.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to apply various tortures and personal humiliations to "suspects".
Every act of inhumanity further fuels the hatred of the Afghan people.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more anti-terrorism, the more terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a commercial and preservation perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded area to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many factories of milk powder and got in touch with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag one year, while the shelf life of the can is two years or longer?
Or another question: why is there such a big price difference between the listening package and the bag package?
Actually, many consumers, or moms, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think the expensive ones are the good ones.
Some consumers even reacted after eating that the taste or flavor of the canned food was different due to this mentality!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reasons for the expensive hearing aids, where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when setting the price, most manufacturers consider that if the bagged price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a significant increase in their list prices to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to promote tinned packaging rather than bag packaging.
Furthermore, how does the manufacturer get the millions or even billions of advertising fees every year that you think of?
Everyone can imagine it.
So with the development of society, the promotion expenses of the market, such as the promotion personnel of the shopping mall, the display expenses of the shopping mall, the gift expenses of the product, and the advertising expenses, are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are listening to wear, and the price is also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, use all means to hook up with doctors in hospitals, and have them help with product promotion, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
And related laws in China absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and store it in a can under the premise of having a can at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned food and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it was cold it was dry and hard, so it was impossible to eat.
And the soup was spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the things he sent from #PRS_ORG# must be cold already.
I haven't taken it!

Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of books on success.
Nowadays, many success books promote the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common feature - either do your best with all your might, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay in the same place.
This "best principle", which everyone would recognize as "absolutely correct", would scare off 99% of people before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a "you must make a firm determination, start over, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is a self-deception and a futile effort to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, sticks to the rules, and refuses to change.
Most people are timid in the face of the word "transformation", reluctant to take a step forward and unable to make a firm decision; or, driven by a momentary impulse, they make a "transformation" determination and bravely take the first step, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that can enable more ordinary people to take the path to relative success.
The core of the "Second Best Principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" -- it encourages a "theory of small wins" that if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
All in all, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold significantly lowered, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success that follows the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, while the "best principle" may appear to be a banner of success for all, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resources have increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the resource reserve of Qinghai Lake naked carp has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the initial protection in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Kunyu", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed and biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the environment in the spawning areas of the naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the continuous increase of protection efforts has led to an increasing amount of resources of naked carp in Qinghai Lake.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of “one river, one river, one lake”.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to put it in the bag, it's cold outside.
Can I ask if the takeout is packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or taken away by someone, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about taking a vacation, it was too long.
Give a science popularization to men who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around the age of 50.
Under the premise of good health, it will come once a month regularly.
But it's not regular enough to make accurate predictions, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, it can suddenly come several days earlier.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some have it for three days, some for a week; some have little blood flow, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away by an ambulance; pain can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it lasts for several days, 24 hours of bleeding. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton strips to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. If you take ibuprofen before the pain starts at the beginning of the menstrual cycle, it can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the cramps start will not be of much use.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the period, if you have an inexplicable stomachache, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Except for sleeping time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared ones, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
The sanitary cotton swab does not need to be changed frequently, about every five or six hours, and at most eight hours.
Hormonal influence during menstruation may make one more irritable, and the fluctuation of hormones during ovulation can also cause mood instability, making it a really unlucky time when the body trips itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, it contains shed endometrium.
After the menstrual period ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and a new house (endometrium thickening) is built every month to welcome guests. If the guests don't come, it will be dismantled (menstrual bleeding) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, a few days of 24-hour bleeding every month, plus abdominal and back pain, who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and finds the preparation of a woman's body for childbirth disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime, don't be so ungrateful and don't understand the boundaries. How can they face their own mother with this attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they really work.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, sending the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
Order an extra meal for the kids.
Hope that the store will check the output even in the midst of a hundred busy tasks.
Is the tingling sensation when soaking feet in a foot bath due to an electrical leak?
Choosing the right foot bathtub can have a good therapeutic and health care effect. Today, Gome's small editor will answer this question and hope to help our friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are very popular, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and it lit up unexpectedly. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the already popular foot bath tub in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it is suitable for, what material is safe, etc.
Generally speaking, there is no electrical issue with foot baths, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-type foot bath basin.
Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
On the morning of December 10th, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Vice Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician Liu Zhonghua, a professor of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: The source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum for "Five-color Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea categories taking turns to strengthen their efforts. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving the income of tea farmers.
The wind and water turn in turn, and red tea is gaining strength again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants chose a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and placed an order immediately.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
New Red Tea adds a touch of red, imbuing it with the cultural connotations of tea. Popular and in high demand, the Xiang Tea Industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception by means of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The one above is called the Way, the one below is called the Instrument" in the "Book of Changes•Transmission of the Upper Text", which was translated from metaphysics by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue (in the Meiji era).
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology and its related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any reference to God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and researches human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior norms people should abide by, applies ethics (the academic of applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from the observed patterns).
It does not start from the expected theory for the examination of ethics, but rather investigates the real moral agent's actual choices made and observed, all the moral factors that lead to this decision, and it studies the ethical views held by the social group.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Ethical thoughts of Humanism, represented by such people as Vala and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thinking of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empiricist ethics, representative figures: Hume, etc., 17-18th century, continental rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Li Kaer, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional period ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic typically includes three parts: inductive reasoning, causal reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since my relatives had an accident, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has never stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families and jobs.
It was your kind deed that helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the novel coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease the humanitarian donation to the Tiananmen Mothers group, a difficult-to-subdue group, and that this humanitarian relief activity should already have been concluded with a perfect ending.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Federation of Chinese Student Societies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Fund are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often cross over.

Relief funds often cannot reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund", and has been implementing it until now.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations from the year of June Fourth, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Research Foundation for Reformation through Labor.
Until last year, after a 31-year wait, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, China Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called off the June 4th donation out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes that are not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate the project within two years and, if necessary, resume it immediately.
We express our gratitude and respect to those generous and brave comrades who have been persistently donating humanitarian aid funds and taking risks for many years.

Thank you for the rabbit's comment. Originally, I said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can give us the energy to move forward. We'll keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all the friends to come here!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is nothing to picky about.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate, and can match a suitable makeup for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also first-line big brands.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats accompanying to play.
We are working in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing need to be queued up half a year in advance. My colleague took pictures in Beijing, and after seeing the finished product, I felt it was just so-so.
I specially searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not good at managing our facial expressions, and we think this is the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-rounded team.
We and the people around us all praised it without hesitation when it came out.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she was just as delighted after seeing the photos.
I hope such a studio won't be buried, more people can discover it, take out their own style instead of being monotonous.

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to teach yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will not have much meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is better to inquire about the training institution, and it is even better to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't given any introduction about your own situation. Learning this thing has a lot to do with personal circumstances.
For example, profession, age, language to be learned, and even in which city, all these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now, many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one has a high cost of learning, two requires more time input, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet for free, or you can go to B station for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time cost for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way of learning does not require too much effort, and the teachers' explanations are also detailed. There are also people who answer questions specifically, and there is also help in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of things.
Above are my opinions. Because I don't know your situation, I can only give a brief introduction, not detailed. If you have other inquiries, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it on the App.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance) wall-mounted stove hot water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, installation of lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional beauty stitching, and housekeeping services.
Thank those who silently give me likes, strive hard for life, life is tired but keep going.
Life won't disappoint those who work hard, like and follow me, thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life, others only see the result, while you have to endure the process alone. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back.
Cleaning is not only a job but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the fatigue is worth it, and there will be a return for the effort!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services have done "clean" to the best of my ability, serving the loving home.
Keep every family clean, set up a household governance monument, serve in place, clean to the home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will also become dull and lose their light. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Success comes from doing with heart, delicacy shapes delicacy, we are serious about beauty stitching.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is trustworthy. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any industry right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day's plan lies in the morning, all the good starts from the morning. I hope you start a new day with joy, luck, health and good luck. Keep a good mood all day. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something to be possessed; when we grow up, happiness becomes a goal to be achieved; when we mature, we find out that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it brings happiness.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, live brightly until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Many times, what binds you is not ability, but the courage to face it actively.
Since we can't avoid it, it's better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face the difficulties, the problems will eventually be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia collaborate to hold the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and China UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Fei Yu, Director of China UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, as Artistic Director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically reflects the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabian social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly concerned, some of which used recycled materials in a novel way, such as Xu Bing in "The Story Behind the Endless Picture of Xishan" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Daryl Yeo, CEO of the Biennale Foundation, expressed his hope that this Biennale will be able to establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative communities that are booming in Saudi Arabia, and to strengthen mutual exchanges.
Tanya Feifel said, "The goal of the Biennial is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in a global dialogue and to enable Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening period of the biennial, a series of lectures will be held, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continuously help the people out of poverty and employment, consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to help promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant responsible person of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the poverty alleviation group to realize employment income increase, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly unified the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and positions are set according to the principles of "setting positions according to needs, determining personnel according to positions, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one position per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts. The regulations also stipulate that the development departments of each rural public welfare post should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for personnel stationed in rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?

Has it been cancelled?
Although the right-wing has had its moments of success in history, they have not lasted long. Therefore, they are short-lived because they flourish in the sun and sweat in the rain; they get a little success and they become arrogant, and they are easily defeated.
But to be realistic, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards since the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of governance and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, as for me, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his statements and also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes seriously the social issues of China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-necessity revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage the people's livelihood, political groups will be mixed up, and foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunities for their own gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk more.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this transformation, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, recently I have seen some friends arguing with the villains while refuting the madman, and they are quite angry. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or lunatics, they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the rebels and the left-wingers admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the counter-revolutionaries scold you for five cents, and when the left-wingers scold you for the right-wingers, it just proves that our middle way is the right one!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals or pursue them obsessively.
Gradually, the ideal is getting further away, and even the dragon-slaying teenager eventually becomes an evil dragon.
In my opinion, left and right usually refer to constraint and freedom. Due to the innate genetic of Chinese history and culture, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now, the general society hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the competition between China and the US is leaning to the left, which is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
No more words, Flower is so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to US-based companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allies' related companies to blockade China's chip industry at the same time, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the chip shortage has affected all major industries around the world, such as car companies suspending production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are severely affected.
In order to gain control of "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights, restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently been active, either hosting the "Chip Summit" or inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing to support US local technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old US technology giant Intel invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened chip OEM business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
That's so certain because Intel, as an old-fashioned tech giant in the US, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and can certainly rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdainfully dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou was amazing, and for Intel's investment in building a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou was outspoken: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the wafer field was due to the grudges between TSMC and Intel that still lingered in his mind from more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, dominating the global peak and the world's semiconductor field.
Up until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed from design, manufacture to final test by a single factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of burden on small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only give up in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Integrated Circuit (TSMC) was born.
Focusing on the single link of "wafer processing", Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) does not design, but only provides wafer manufacturing outsourcing services.
At the time, the newly established TSMC was a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
It was unexpected that the giant that looked down on the wafer manufacturing service in the past now has to start doing wafer outsourcing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was ironic.
Now the market capitalization of TSMC has surpassed Intel.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive offensive, Intel naturally cannot remain stagnant.
Nowadays, TSMC has already sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel still stays at the 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not an easy task.
Don't wait.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some of the weirdest trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Good Friends Price Increase, Huo La La Event, public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipate, if secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look no different from the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Network Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a solitary peak, sawtooth, and cliff.
【Isolated Peak】Refers to artificially heating up quickly to attract public attention;【Sawtooth】Refers to periodic heating up to ensure the topic stays on the hot search list;【Cliff】Refers to collective retreat, the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is not even a second, which must be a unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen at a glance: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite war, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgment, which stir up emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different points, almost taking into account all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Propagation is a science, setting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron Rho virus strain-Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12th. According to Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron Rong strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron Rho strain infection on the 10th.
According to Health Minister Kailesh Jagutapal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who, after having been in contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa, tested positive for the coronavirus on November 30th.
After hospital isolation and treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons have turned negative and they have returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are all students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they were all mild cases, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's Health Minister, Kumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had discovered its first three cases of infection with the Omnicron strain.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these 3 infection cases.

Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, No. 156, Huancheng South Road
It was introduced by a friend at the beginning because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they started a series of scams.
This is my first time to the store, I just showed them my house type map, they did not measure the house on site, they could even give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan, they roughly showed me their materials but I don't know what brand they are.
Their second scam is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this money can never be refunded unless you have enough experience and fight them in theory).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you could get if you paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being cheated, in a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His offer to me has many issues - 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service charge is higher than that of other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything first.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, it's the customer's problem and they are completely blameless.
There are many details of various kinds of shirking responsibility, and I don't want to say them all, it's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house they renovated was also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Damn it, they are the same scammers who used to be called Longtou Decoration, now they changed their name to Da Mei, and now it seems like they have closed down again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a rip-off decoration company.
In the future, when we choose, let's Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
All forms of merchant reviews are strictly prohibited. Please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then. If you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

The starry sky has an appointment | The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian). Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Beijing Astronomy Enthusiasts Anjiu took a picture of the Gemini Meteor Shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini Meteor Shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, "show time" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its high and steady flow rate, and together with the Geminids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow in speed, rich in color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astronomical photography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomical enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
Twin Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower "Luo Ying Bin Fen" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the level of excitement will be discounted.
On the 14th of the lunar calendar, it is November 11th, the moon phase is a full moon, the bright moonlight will cause interference to observation, fortunately, in the late night the moon will fall, at this time the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but pay attention to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, less light pollution, facing northeast and with a wide view in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, so there is no need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to take beautiful 'meteor shower shots', and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripod, spare batteries and shutter release cable are also essential considering stability and continuity.
Peng reminded to build.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the topic starter should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or in other words, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, the sales of laser TVs in 2020 will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for its good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Sazhi Laboratory of China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmologists of Beijing Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison experiment of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics, and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
With more and more attention being paid to visual health, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and the prices are gradually rising with the upgrade of size and light source.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short-throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small host occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generated is lower, the equipment loss is smaller, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and inadequate viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can make your own judgment. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield some ambient light, the use of microstructured Fieller curtains is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
Furthermore, I particularly despise projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point, saying it is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the projection screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. LCD TVs are also "directly" diffused. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated as well?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it cannot form an image at all.
What is really uncomfortable is that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen has been neglected, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, which specializes in quality products, does not have any branches yet.
After adding WeChat to make a reservation, the lady sent me the available time slots, and she replied to my messages in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the little sister about my ideas. She was very patient and helped me try on two sets of styles I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start makeup and styling~ The photographer will set up some props before shooting and guide the action. He is also very meticulous about every detail.
But it might not be the style I want because we didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style, which feels very thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the piece, just wait for the result~
I won the photography-themed Bawang Meal activity for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the store can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He feels a bit green, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is quite pleasant.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery - Quality Selection Store - Reply
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
First fill in your name and phone number at the store, then choose the clothes, wedding dresses can also be selected. After changing three or four sets of clothes, they were still very patient. After selecting, makeup took a long time, and the service attitude was also good. Later, the shooting will teach you how to pose. It just feels like the face is too big in the photos. The retouching said it would take half a month, and it was sent in three or four days. It feels like there is no difference from the original.
The environment is overall okay.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside is the photography studio.
The service is very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the poses.
If unsatisfied, the photographer will proactively suggest a reshoot.
[Experience] The original double eyelids may have been over-styled and turned into triple eyelids.
Even the eyebrows were shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily makeup without eyebrows.
The photos arrived ten days ago, but the photoshopping effect was not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because I wasn't quite sure what style to go for, I tried on two sets, and after much deliberation, I chose the black dress. The saleslady said this set was more of a Hepburn-esque retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. Both the hairdresser and makeup artist were very patient in helping me. The effect was very satisfactory.
After doing my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected my four favorite ones for retouching. The photographer said he would have the finished product ready within 15 days and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first, and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
According to the conditions set, to become an insurance broker company, three key words must be met: shareholders, no major violations in the past three years of the initiator, and a minimum limit of RMB 50 million must be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, one must have the strength, be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating all insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders must have good style. As an insurance broker, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question too much whether Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can achieve.
On this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Shengtai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claim party and the insurer are both Shengtai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: the products of Internet platforms, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of sales staff, the price-performance ratio of Internet products is generally higher, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the insurance salesperson: this is especially important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements. Many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, which may lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declaration and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insured, thinking that they are healthy or in compliance, which may easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance phone sales at "Tencent Weibao" (just like Xiaoyusan, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but people are not. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the insured, the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and they don't know what they bought.
It is like spending one dollar to get an insurance company to pay six million (the world is like a lucky draw).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning SMS is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - free coverage of 600,000 critical illness amount, which is short-term. If only relying on this, without other commercial insurance, if a serious illness really occurs, 600,000 can't do anything to solve the problem, and life will start to be naked.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, there is no problem with the platform and the product, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the topic starter should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products also have better cost-performance ratio than Internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare prices for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody, and let customers be worry-free.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the policyholder to complete all the insurance procedures by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, the insurance advisor does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although the purchase of internet insurance may not have a "ceremonial feeling" and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" assembly line work, but such insurance purchase will also have a fatal problem, that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we purchase insurance and consider whether the intermediary we choose is an insurance intermediary who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery staff?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider left it at the door, and then the person left.
Still send wrong
Your rider has already picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but I'm still being told to wait.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to start.

No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I oppose any form of defamation and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we do not take party and faction into consideration, what we should resist first is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me a Facebook friend request, to when you posted teasing posts, and then to when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After you changed, not only did you tag me at a rate of six meals a day, but you also continued to talk about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, some of which were subtle and humiliating remarks about my appearance, body shape, good health, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed, etc. I... just let it go.
How did I know later that I received more friends sending Facebook friend accounts with a photo of you and sexually harassing comments?
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After the news of my reporting the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but instead became more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, implicit, embarrassing, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are just caring and paying attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your chart or continue to make all offensive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need you to comment on.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you doing?
I said it, but you don't believe it.
I don't think any girl can still say she's okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe justice lies in the heart of man.
I have cut out some of the messages for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the post you sent out yourself, right?
I can only say you are a civilized public enemy.
A knowing smile

The mainstream of the Yangtze River realizes full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area - Xinhua News Network
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu have built 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of the sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River ship pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to ships and crew, helping crew members solve "urgent and anxious" problems.
The two water green comprehensive service areas built and operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life service, production service and government service, taking green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue service as the characteristic, realizing the "one-time berthing and multiple services" of ships in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal, the rare visit to Guam, sends an important signal to the US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of the Chinese Think Tank, on January 9, a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected that the USS Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier carrying F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy aircraft carrier currently sailing in the Pacific is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region also has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, The Most Powerful Weapon Rarely Visits Guam On January 17, 2022, US Navy Carrier-Based Transport Aircraft CMV-22B Flight Route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness)
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The US three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon has rarely visited Guam. Analysts say this is a signal sent to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second open visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon has rarely visited Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrated the US's capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Raging Bull" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secret of ballistic missile submarines has made "Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", which also includes launch wells for ballistic missiles on the US mainland, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop of Meta and the evaporation of 251 billion US dollars in market value, why did Mark Zuckerberg respond to "unprecedented competition"?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many Apps external Meta advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is to realize monetization.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to access their own information. Most people's normal response is definitely not allowed.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has about hundreds of employees in the office in Hong Kong, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise at Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China region is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has already passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just a drop in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but more importantly, on expectations for the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current popularity, it still has a strong sense of crisis. With an annual revenue of between 10 and 20 billion US dollars, it has no strong safety net compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software now have a higher daily activity and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Trying to achieve the unattainable concept of the universe in a short period of time is completely hopeless, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new tracks. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and it is a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
