Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such an incident from happening again.

At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students took the lead in singing and their research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Agency.
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of creative academic achievements were commended, such as using air to wash hands, using smell to judge diseases, and accurately searching for the source of haze.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, covering major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biometric sensors: your home health check-up doctor.
Doctoral students from the School of Biomedical Engineering, Zhang Diming's team, demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-end biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to take a breath and this device can detect your body health condition from the components of the exhaled air.
Zhang Diming introduced that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smartwatches on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this biosensor uses graphene, a new type of material, whose target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: High-powered Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the Silver Award at this year's 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition.
The team of master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new perspective on the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are detected and removed too late due to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical light has four light discs, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgery, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air-washing hands: water-saving and cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qi Zhang and his classmates invented a set of "air hand-washing devices".
Just by standing on the device at the sink, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
So, we can get our hands clean!
The colorimetric test and bacterial residue test showed that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleanliness, but also save 90% of the water, and the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-leading universities and won the only gold prize.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when sudden events occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency help is needed.
If I really suffer from a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes to save our lives, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and unable to do anything, which is a terribly helpless feeling.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths each year, with cardiac arrest being the most dangerous.
On average, 15% of those in the US can be saved.
At Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, pressing on their chest will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save a person.
I find that few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing sudden situations.
It might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turn 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was also something I did a few months ago, and I'm glad to say I achieved it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, planning to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The 13 yuan shrimp dumpling is just one!?
Never tried it.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
Does one cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# messed up the delivery, this time only giving me one shrimp dumpling!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally think Four Seas is an all-around bad movie in every sense.
But you can't say that this movie doesn't have any highlights either, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, ones that make you fall asleep in the cinema, ones that make you angry after watching, 'Four Seas' is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creature from a crime novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may suspect that there are metaphors implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you will find that it is actually a pile of crap.
To start off, I find it difficult to understand some of the plotlines.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
Are elderly people taking a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad were very reassured about it.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get the business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
Why are the island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a stretch of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the driver could not be found around.
The prop feels too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and criminal suspicions become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't they report the high-interest loan to the police in the movie, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a hotel key card, and then has to arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the film, and it is so outlandish that I feel pain when I recall it.
Worse than the plot, the movie's theme, or lack thereof, was simply an abominable patchwork.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think he wanted to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be a motivational movie, halfway through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep doubts about why you went to the cinema to enjoy the crap during the New Year.
For most people, they are also familiar with the tropes of various movies, such as if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, it would be inspirational and comedic, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually moves towards success.
If you want to make a romance movie, you can tell a story about a small town young man who loves to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl and their complicated relationship.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
For example, the character Yoon Jeong plays (the one whose new motorcycle was burned but still can sing), cannot explore ideas that even Kennedy couldn't withstand.
As for the female lead, who obviously isn't mentally challenged, yet acts like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the actor's performance or the director's requirement.
I'm also puzzled why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is such movie arrangement during the Spring Festival to add to the viewers' troubles?

For example: various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have grooves on the top, bottom, left and right sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear strength of the well wall is far superior to that of the flat-friction masonry form.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being combined and masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are connected. After the core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules have lacing slots both horizontally and vertically, with horizontal lacing and vertical lacing correspondingly increasing the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage, etc. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.

Chongqing Vocational Schools are piloting the modern apprenticeship system, where students are considered quasi-employees of the enterprise upon enrollment - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters from the Municipal Education Commission learned that from this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools, and students accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise probationary employees be clarified, and a three-party agreement be signed by apprentices, schools and enterprises according to the principle of two-way selection. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, an agreement must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content and rights protection of apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with partner enterprises to carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for corporate employees.
The pilot schools will reform the talent cultivation model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the cultivation of the educational system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program, and the top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects for intermediate vocational education, with each pilot project having about 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
Following the principle of first piloting and then implementing, gradually advancing from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint cultivation and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively enhance students' job skills, and improve their employment rate and quality.

South African doctors: Omecron is highly contagious, but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, the Omnicron variant, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician organization of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pyle said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more prone to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous outbreak of Delta, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Omnicron variant in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it takes several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severe cases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early days and we need to get the later stage data.
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, but we only had two weeks to enter this wave of the pandemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although the Delta variant remains the most dominant coronavirus strain globally, cases of the Omega variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases in Hauden increased by 400% in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thank you to the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Times Commentary: What Can We Do to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we compare it to the famous public welfare slogan "No buying, no killing", then in a good environment without the demand for "trafficking", collective prevention and public anti-trafficking can make trafficking activities unprofitable, high-risk and high-cost, and this kind of crime will no longer occur frequently.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau has gone online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app "Reunion", one can feel the warmth in full.
New technological means not only have a name of "artistic" and full of feelings, but also are properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking enforcement is to locate and recover the trafficked children, protecting their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed in many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before trafficking cases are solved, the physical safety of the victims should be prioritized.
While differentiating between matters of urgency and importance, topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death" which are highly controversial and have many different opinions can be put aside for now and discussed cautiously; however, rescuing trafficked children is something that cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute of delay in the search for abducted children could mean that the child is one step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases by one point.
Under this situation, taking out effective methods such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to crack cases and find children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, anti-trafficking is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to societies.
For example, a common case is when a family of three was resting at the train station, with the parents asleep, only to wake up and find their child gone.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Taking turns to rest or placing the child under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the buyers of abducted children should also be monitored and punished.
An individual illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking shall be not less than five years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property may be confiscated.
With the high starting point and the heaviest penalty, under the trend of "leniency", child trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
Yet, there are still a significant number of trafficking cases occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated concepts and weak legal awareness when it comes to parenting.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the trafficking "market" is widely present, traffickers are driven by their greed, constantly innovating trafficking methods, forming a "struggle" situation with law enforcement officers, anti-trafficking actions will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong elaborated on the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session from three aspects: ideals, beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and Party leadership and Party theory, combining his own insights and personal experiences in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the plenary session and the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, integrate and apply what we have learned, strengthen our ideological, political, and action awareness of upholding the "two establishements" and achieving the "two safeguards", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to firmly follow the Party, and to use their youth to write responsibility and commitment.

It is not clear whether it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There was no receipt on the bag.
Tracing is not possible.
I hope you understand.
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No more, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been swapped.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be efficient in handling.
They waited for several hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, pure taste and fragrant aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: It has an acceptable taste and flavor, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity higher than 3.3% is refined, or known as "second-pressed oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is a transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil extracted from the pomace by dissolution and then refined.
If you have seen the grading classification, you should have already noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olives, like grapes used to make wine, from different regions and varieties will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best place for olive tree growth is:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Outside of the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow sparsely in suitable areas.
The main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and even countries far south of the equator such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, have similar climates.
The harvesting months for olives:
From March to June each year, olives trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit develops and matures, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the harvesting season for the fruit (freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, will conclude on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people around the world and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that plans are in place to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representatives Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, burning in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the whole society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the forces of authoritarian buffer and shock, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Agnes Chow delivered a pre-recorded video speech at the summit, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights conditions of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must collaborate.
We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threats of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you have not recognized the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And that is why we fail.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, issued a "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of resistance to autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly on the front line of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used the pretext of public health and collective interest to justify the violation of human rights, indicating a global retreat of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down false information to win the battle.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, identified as serious human rights violators, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights abuses.
I have taken and uploaded the photos to you.
I know.
But the restaurant did not know why the delivery time was constantly being delayed.
Originally it was #NUMBER#.
In any case, I won't be calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier if you couldn't deliver it?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I didn't receive any calls.
Please inform him to deliver to our company again.
I don't want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
They waited for an hour and a half at the restaurant.
#PRS_ORG# has yet to be sent.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
If you want to try tennis but are afraid that you won't be able to stick with it, you can find a class at a reasonable price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level cameras" are actually industrial garbage.
They have low strength, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, the hard ball can't bear it, and skilled players find it difficult to control.
The underlying logic and implication of these rackets is - tennis is so hard that you won't be able to learn it, and you won't be willing to buy an expensive one, so let's give you a cheap one to fool you. You'll play it twice and then you won't play it anymore, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it shows that you have made progress. Come to my place to buy expensive things later, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly better used racket, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough that good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a used one for 200 is also enjoyable like a thousand-dollar one.
It's friendly to newcomers, but it's a letdown after the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Could I help follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you.
So, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I ignore the original one?
Hi, we ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the sesame chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I should take it for no reason, please cancel it.
My order was for delivery, there was no option for self-collection.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with a slightly plump body type when it comes to dressing.
Girls with bigger bodies should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat on the thighs.
Wearing skirts that are too short will reveal any excess fat on the legs.
Wearing clothes that are too long can give a feeling of being short and chubby.
If you wear clothes that divide into three sections, upper, skirt and long socks, in different colors, it will give you a slender look naturally and make you look taller.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are standard for petite plus-size girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for petite plus-size girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are on the thicker side, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid drawing attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of fatness,
Girls with slightly plump figures must pay attention to the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should never wear tight short skirts. The top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with thin grids). Choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the shortcomings of plus-size girls.
Of course, slightly plump girls should also pay attention to what they wear when it comes to skirts.
For a plus-size girl wearing a short skirt, it is recommended to choose a top in the same color as the skirt, which can make your plump figure look taller.
Pairing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN combination for summer!
If you are a MM with a plump upper body but slim legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your strengths.
A-line skirts will look slimming, especially for plus-size girls. Choose tighter tops to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a skirt is also a great option for plus-size women to try.
Plus-size girls can also wear fashionable styles.
With the right styling techniques, even plus-size girls can be the center of attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of "slightly fat girl" one day earlier😄

Xinhua All Media + Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Ignites Winter Olympic Passion - Xinhua News Network
On December 11th, Beijing Dreaming ING team player Pang Yaotian (center) shoots the ball during the match.
On that day, the 2021-2022 Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued to compete in major ice rinks in Beijing.
This year's league is divided into regular season and playoffs, with participants aged from U6 to U18, divided into competitive and selection groups, attracting nearly 3600 players from 256 representative teams in the city.
The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has developed for more than ten years and has now become a platform for Beijing youth ice hockey enthusiasts to exchange skills and make friends, and to provide excellent players for the Beijing youth ice hockey teams and youth teams.
The league plays a driving role in Beijing's youth ice hockey activities, igniting enthusiasm for Olympic ice hockey and laying the foundation for the development of Beijing's ice hockey activities after the Winter Olympics.
The girl is a target for fundraising for her sister: "It's bearable to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News.
A girl at Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise donations for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows that a girl was standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan a arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by could pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot.
The action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Lower Town Branch confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move in order to raise money for her sister, but such behavior was not commendable. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned for collecting donations on the street.
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" written in black ink, and another board in front of her with her bank account and WeChat, Alipay accounts, etc.
The photo caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this act is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens have expressed sympathy for it.
We found the situation when we patrolled around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time.
When police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station were interviewed by local media, they said that there were two girls vending, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful attire.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone for help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Lower City Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jia Li and she was raising donations for her elder sister Jia Yan.
But since the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, they had no better way to raise funds and resorted to this behavior.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were responsible for the target and the other for the hand, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows, but someone was watching and taking pictures to post on Weibo.
After police assessment by the security department, the bow and arrow used did not fall under the category of control.
The official stated that "this kind of fundraising for publicity is not encouraged".
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the station.
Heat dissipation: Good Thinness: Convenient Appearance material: Satisfactory Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
It has stable performance and four air outlets for heat dissipation, making it worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is good, with enough materials and reliable brand!
The Acer Predator Dragon is still reasonably priced.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. Game performance: The game performance is smooth, and I can play most games with a stable high frame rate, which is very smooth. LOL is not a problem, CSGO is also easily handled, and most AAA games can be played.
Heat Dissipation: The heat dissipation is good, the fan is powerful, it works quietly, and the gaming performance is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance Material: Cool and stylish appearance, the game laptop looks great. Display Effect: The screen is clear, 1080 is enough for playing games.
Buying a laptop feels really good, mainly for design, high cost performance, lighter than imagined, also better looking than imagined, the red on the butt is a very nice wine color, not so garish, overall much higher than expected, worth buying, girls are also quite suitable.
I have been using the Acer Nightblade for two years now and it has been a great value for money with its excellent quality.
I have also recommended this product to my friends around me!
I have already purchased three machines from this series!
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also good.
I had wanted to wait for the 418 bank promotion to buy it for my nephew, but he needed it urgently so I had to buy it in advance and missed out on the big bank promotion, which is a bit of a shame.
The price-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back and review it after a while.
A brand new gaming laptop with ultra-high cost performance, nice design, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for the child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problem, this computer can do 3D design work performance.
He said it was very good for the one I bought for my son.
The computer is good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, ask if you don't understand, recommend buying.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What will be the hottest thing in 2021?
No doubt it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more inevitable.
What appears to be a joke of an article also reveals the daily struggles of project managers, representing the lack of power behind current project management work.
People engaged in project management are also gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional Certification) registrations every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of people who applied for PMP® in China was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 holding valid certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" and that the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn to explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners say that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management related knowledge points, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on and on; unclear division of labor among members, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, poor communication between departments, and difficulty in advancing the project...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of R&D key talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It brings the online course of "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" here.
The online course "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D-type enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and fewer investments, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
Not to be taken on face value, let's take a look at what other students have to say about the course: The course is not only taught by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and easy-to-understand explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

Jiexin advocated rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 17.7 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The various discounts and red envelopes, as well as the eye-catching live broadcast of goods, have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this wave of consumption has made people marvel at the increasing strength of national consumption power, on the other hand, we must also calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the young is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial institutions should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jexin has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to promote the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, Creditease has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities, it has launched various forms of innovative practice competitions to subtly guide the consumption needs of young groups, help them establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth in life.
As Double Twelve approaches, Jexin reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the consumer loan misunderstanding, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, one must plan ahead and act within their means to make timely repayments.
If you are overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on your economic life such as buying a car or buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Network - GCC Working Together to Address Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour included Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit by the Crown Prince to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, with the Gulf countries signing an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the effort to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with two countries' businesses signing 13 cooperation memorandums worth $3 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal condemned by the Gulf Arab states for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is deficient to not address the Iranian missile issue and take no action to curtail Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Their goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to slowing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the resolution of disputes between some of its members and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the Gulf Union and to propose measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the supercars in the New Shan district have the loudest exhaust sound!
This car that our team has brought to you is a dream for many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
With a price tag of nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit and road tax of over ten thousand Ringgit per year, and four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
Well, I don't know either, the data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means while myvi is still at 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h, wow.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge air intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
Not much needs to be said about the car models, just Google it yourself, and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
Being in the spotlight and having everyone's eyes on you wherever you go can be quite uncomfortable, but it can also be quite thrilling!
Drivers don't care about the cost of 1km of fuel, which is around RM1.
Practice getting on and off the vehicle, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deafened after getting off (but it's still very cool).
The car is too big to fit in a regular parking spot, and I'm afraid it will get dinged when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely since there are no opponents on the road (said by the editor, not related to the driver, haha).
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who would like to take videos of your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Take a look at the results and you'll find that you're right!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News.
The so-called spirit of a university refers to a series of educational philosophies and values that have been accumulated over the course of its development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "promoting virtue and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious, the global competition in education, technology and talents is intensifying, and higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" not only demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country to move from a higher education power to a higher education strong nation, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class in a shorter period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, and realize "overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catch-up with the world's advanced level.
It should be especially noted that the construction of world-class universities cannot be the same for all schools, and each school must show its own characteristics and features while giving full play to its advantages.
Schools should have both common Chinese characteristics and their own unique goals, teaching traditions and resources.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to three distinctive aspects in running the school: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment of science and technology integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University-Industry-Research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the spirit of the university, and to resonate the spirit of the university with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Cultivation, Discernment, and Diligence", and the common expression of the Zhejiang spirit of "Embracing Rivers and Seas, Opening True Virtue, Opening the World and Building Our Country" constitute the latest expression system.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "embracing rivers and seas" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", and embodying the high-quality concept of education from world-renowned universities; "seeking truth and cultivating virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and being good, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also cultivating moral character and personality; "reforming and innovating" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, but also reform and development, and breaking with the old and ushering in the new; "building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share weal and woe with the nation's destiny.
These spiritual concepts and values are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
"The wise listens to the silence, the wise sees in the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the era of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs quickly gained popularity, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of play styles including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a total transaction volume of over $3 billion.
Data from TokenTerminal showed that Axie Infinity had daily revenue of more than 8.2 million US dollars, rivaling that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially reported that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
Axie Infinity is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single roles, they can not only get fun and economic gains from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This sense of agency is not granted by the game developer, but rather secured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway is the selection of the industry for investment, that is, the selection of the target industry. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good growth potential in the future, considering the industry with the best growth potential in the future 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the industry's development stage, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the industry's competitive pattern.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics is about "doing the things right", that is, doing things correctly.
And strategy lies in "do the right thing", that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on top of increasing customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); on top of increasing customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, making it the first time Bitcoin has been a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in eight years, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups have complained that Ivy League schools such as Yale are discriminating in their admissions - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has doubled, but in these three American universities, the proportion of Asians has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian applicants" in their so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu-Kong introduced that according to the research of Sanders et al. in 2014, Asian students had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants at the three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also showed that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told Xinhua reporters that they expect the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after the appeal is submitted, and to take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the facts are determined.
They also expect the universities involved in the complaint to take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans.
So far, the three universities involved in the complaints have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education declined to take action on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups involved in the appeal, Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups were also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agent about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt" as the receiver, which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller is not willing to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, afterwards the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the house sale contract being unable to be signed for a long time.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, Mr. Lu had already paid the deposit and prepared the house payment, but just as he was about to sign the contract, the seller changed his mind, leaving Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing the case, the court found that since the parties had ultimately failed to enter into a formal contract, the blame could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of the double return of the deposit.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
【Lawyer's Reminder】 Both parties should fulfill their necessary duty of due diligence during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" ended on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday (December 11) that the US holding the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" is "drawing lines with ideology, weaponizing democracy, acting in the name of false democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the US has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'mass destructive weapon' used by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US for its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been voices of questioning both internationally and domestically, such as criticism of the invited leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, with some questioning whether the Biden administration's true intention in organizing the summit was for democracy or for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Angela Merkel also participated in the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming increasingly severe. The US democracy is a 'rich man's game' built on a capital base."
President Biden stated in his speech, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be a buffer and force against authoritarianism, and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is a decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces persistent and worrying challenges".
The US side promised to launch a one-year action after the Democratic Summit, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The US hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democracy summit at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send it to the wrong address.

It has been several years since I last ate at Rizhao, and the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.

What is the drinking method for Red Label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you would be wasting its rich flavor.
So how do you drink Red Label whisky?
The editor will give a brief introduction for everyone.
Ways to Drink Red Label Whisky:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
It has a rich and refreshing taste with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice, or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red Label whisky has entered the Chinese market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky mixed with cola, sprite, or Fanta has become a timelessly fashionable drink.
These sweet drinks not only neutralize the sourness, but also bring pleasure to the eyes. Adding them to the drink can dilute the taste and change the taste.
Red Label whisky + slices of lemon + sugar (or rock sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Vermouth has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, while lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to individual taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. Hope my introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How to Make College Exams Fair for Both "Ace Students" and "Average Students" - Xinhua News
The three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to raise the difficulty of the exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, college exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In college campuses, students come from all over the world with varying levels of ability and different levels of learning, resulting in a wide range of learning outcomes.
Assessing such a diverse group will inevitably lead to different perceptions.
Of course, if the exam questions are too monotonous and repetitive, and the questions are too simple, it will certainly create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass an exam with a last-minute burst of intense study, and if they use other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is the "strange situation" of "academic underachievers" who can pass the exams without much effort and even get high scores; and "academic elites" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, but don't score much higher in exams.
It appears that the students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without cause in reflecting the issues in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
We should applaud the three students who wrote the letters for their courage.
In fact, those who have been to university are well aware that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, strive for the scope of the exam, and even sneak in a cheat sheet during the exam or ask the teacher for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, measuring the qualification of a university exam lies more in the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage of college, majors begin to specialize, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a student has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
Whereas undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic theories and common sense of the subject, the scope of variation is not large, and it is basically fixed in terms of knowledge points.
As teachers have said, "The basic knowledge of learning university mathematics 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a priority."
However, the fact that the knowledge points remain the same does not mean that the exam questions are single-type and repetitive.
In many universities, the exam is usually composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior subject teachers coordinate to form the test paper. The exam marking is also participated by all teachers who undertake the subject, so that it can overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that meet the actual needs of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation is also needed to comprehensively analyze the students' learning level, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, which can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time, innovate the design of the types of questions.
Examinations are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of examination, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values students' suggestions and has deployed a rectification plan across the school.
Require teaching units to organize teachers to carry out discussion and course final exam self-inspection, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine the score evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
From a mechanism point of view, solving problems such as single type of test questions and repeated questions is an issue that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, thus allowing "excellent students" and "poor students" to get what they deserve.
If you are unable to change the store location for me, can it be changed to delivery?
Do I not need to give any more money then?
The colleague's orders have been delivered.
I can't pull it off.
What about GPS? Is it here yet?
Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) currently does not have any branches.
Before the photoshoot, we had to change the time twice due to our poor time management, but Lanlan, the consultant, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later they chose to shoot on a good weather weekend.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first time putting on makeup properly, wow~ I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The outdoor shoot was taken at Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. During the shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix it if there was something wrong.
The photographer is also very humorous, and they feel happy after a day of taking pictures.
When selecting the photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want the customers to delete too many photos, but when we were selecting the photos, there was really no intention to add any photos, just the 24 photos in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, the 7,000 package even added more than 10,000 photos, I was shocked at that time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two that weren't quite right and they immediately helped me fix them again.
When I flipped through the photos my sister took before and compared them, I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Mrs. Xuanhan Jin for wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful for your sincere wishes and wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of the special anti-counterfeiting paper stock, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since the beginning of October, with a cumulative total of 3200 people affected.
However, the director of the bureau, Keralamunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will be issued with the anti-counterfeit paper when it arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the reports of a local media outlet that Sabah newspaper printing had been delayed for 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing the special security paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah News is different from other regions, so it cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Keluamunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The agency will send personnel to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week, and immediately return to Sabah for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicants in two working days (December 20).
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to pick up the birth registration form."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
They had been waiting since more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there then?
I'm referring to food.
I waited across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Junior High School Admitted Special Talents in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd of the month, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission will organize unified examinations for middle school admissions of special talent students.
This year, the districts of Beijing have compressed the proportion of gifted student admissions, making the competition for gifted students even more intense.
For example, in Dongcheng District, the overall proportion of special students admitted to junior high school from primary school this year does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted to school does not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control in port cities, with 48 hours of nucleic acid negative results and the establishment of "buffer zones".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia in port cities, requiring people who have recently left the land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to the land border port cities should undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arriving.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
Officials from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and exchanges between the two sides are frequent.
Implement differentiated management policies in different areas, transforming from one line of defense to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the checkpoint forward, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local cluster cases in China, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as epidemic monitoring and early warning not timely, high-risk personnel closed-loop management not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing is formal, cold chain items not disinfected in each link, centralized isolation places not managed properly, and epidemic emergency disposal not scientific and accurate.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, establishing an epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight defense line against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the work of people's livelihood security, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities include land, water, and air ports in the county (city, district, banner), city (di, state, league), and directly-controlled city where they are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in time by each province (autonomous region, directly-controlled city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube Video Exposes the Truth of US Military's Bloodthirsty Slaughter for 20 Years - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machines" on YouTube gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the past 20 years of bloodshed and killing of the innocent.
The abuse of drone strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and establishes killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, US forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects".
The atrocities stirred up even more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" is a case of "the more you fight it, the more terror you get".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which explains why the customer wants to do canning in the bonded zone, even though canning is a deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company. Here is the article that may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many factories of milk powder and got in touch with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are the same, without any difference.
So everyone is sure to ask: why is the shelf life of bagged coffee one year, while the shelf life of canned coffee is two years or longer?
Or you may ask: Why is there such a big price difference between the tinned and bagged versions?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different after they ate it with this mentality!
Now I will explain to everyone why hearing aids are expensive, where does the expense come from?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the bag pricing is too high, consumers are hard to accept, which means the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even no profits, then how can the manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they have had a large increase in pricing for their audio equipment to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote canned rice rather than bagged rice.
And you think so many companies spend hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in advertising every year. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
So as society develops, the costs of market promotion, such as mall promoters, mall display fees, product gift fees, and advertising fees, are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are also continuously introducing new products, and they are audio equipment, and their prices are also increasing continuously. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to gain higher profits, in fact the increase in their raw material costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Additionally, some brands, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary and collaborate with doctors in hospitals, having them assist in the promotion of the products, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact this practice is to defraud consumers.
It is suggested that people with cans at home buy bagged milk powder and put it into the cans, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any effect on the children.
Also, don't assume that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to spoilage.
The delivery was late and the food was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup also spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the things he #PRS_ORG# sent as replacements will definitely be cold.
I didn't take anything!
#NAME# said that none of you went to take it.
We called them.
If you don't refund me, I will call the police.
Having used #PRS_ORG# multiple times, today's experience was the worst.
Absolutely unacceptable.
OK, let's go.
But restaurants and delivery riders should also be reminded.
Avoid it from happening again.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time is constantly being delayed.
We don't know until when.
Can I get a refund if I cancel my order?
How do I pay a service fee to the rider?

Don't let others intimidate you at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting the book market, one often feels the popularity of success-related books.
Today's success books often promote "best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, we have skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either give it your all or don't do anything at all; either 100% or 0%; either climb Mount Tai or stay put.
This "best practice" mentality makes everyone agree that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180-degree change," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, adheres to the rules and refuses to change.
Most people will be timid in front of the word "transformation", reluctant to move forward, and unable to make a firm decision; or with a momentary impulse to make a "transformation" determination, and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, can not persist for a while, it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way to enable more ordinary people to take the path to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a great victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold greatly reduced, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
Success following the "second-best principle" just takes a bit longer.
In short, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner of success for all, but in reality it only motivates a few; whereas the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

This year, the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserve has increased by 71,000 tons - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserve increased by 7,100 tons this year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the amount at the beginning of the protection in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive human hunting and the deteriorating environment of the naked carp breeding water area, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the protection efforts are continuously increasing through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, and the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources has exceeded 23%.
The Three Rivers Source Region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, so I had to fit everything in it, and it was cold outside.
Can I ask if the take-out is packed in a bag?
We only saw a bag.
Want to know if it was missed or someone took it away, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just read an article about PMS and it was too long.
Give men some knowledge they may not know.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly on one day between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around age 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of good health, it will come once a month in a regular manner.
But it's not regular enough to make an accurate prediction, so it's necessary to prepare in advance with a tolerance of about a week. Sometimes bad luck can also cause it to come earlier than expected.
The duration, amount of blood, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person; some may last for three days, some for a week; some may have light bleeding, some may have heavy bleeding; some may have no response, some may be in so much pain that they need to be taken away in an ambulance; menstrual cramps may change over time, just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt in the future.
Menstrual flow cannot be controlled and it can last for several days, 24 hours a day. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the menstrual cramps start won't be of much help.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release, diarrhea is likely.
If it's around the time of your period and you have unexplained abdominal pain, your period should usually arrive within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, which is 42 pads for 7 days a month. If you add the extra prepared ones, it may be 50 pads, not one pad per month.
If you are using an eye mask, make sure to replace the clean cotton swab every 5-6 hours, or at most 8 hours, to ensure optimal comfort and safety.
Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual period can make you more irritable, and the emotional instability during ovulation due to hormone changes can be quite unfortunate, making it difficult for your body to keep up.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Bleeding is not just blood, it also includes shedding of the uterine lining.
After the end of the menstrual period, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, building a house (endometrium thickening) every month to welcome guests, if the guests do not come, all will be dismantled (menstrual discharge) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; for decades, it involves bleeding for a few days every month, as well as abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother has menstruation, which is to prepare the house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Previously, many things for women were suppressed, society brainwashed women to think that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a woman's body for the creation of life is disgusting, it should not be said in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like this anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime, don't be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude and how can they think of their own children?
Finally, sisters should try sanitary cotton swabs, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and giving wrong gifts is quite disappointing.
Please order separately for the children to eat.
We hope that the store will check the products even in the midst of their busy work.
Does the foot bath basin feel numb when taking a foot bath due to electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can have great therapeutic and health benefits. Today, Gome's small editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
Compared with traditional home appliances, health care home appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"Soaking your feet in electrified water is really too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the pen and it lit up. To his surprise, Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant and their attitude was still good, but Mr. Li still felt unhappy even though he had returned the foot bath.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the highest temperature setting, which people it is suitable for, and what materials guarantee safety for this foot bath that has been popular for a long time.
However, generally speaking, there is no electric shock problem with the foot bath, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-type foot bath tub.
With water and electricity separation, there are no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a multimeter to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair Opens - Headline View - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Today morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Hunan Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry. (Reported by Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Liu Xiaoling, and Li Jian of the Hunan Daily on December 10th)
Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: The source of Hunan Red is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum for the "Five-Colored Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea categories taking turns to strengthen, the main tea producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, and driving the income of tea farmers.
The tide turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea experts in the province said that by picking green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers can have income all year round, and the value of the tea garden will rise steadily.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua celebrated the "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Xincha Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Binglichun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary Wang Zhun of the Provincial Tea Association said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to a certain extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xianghua Red Tea has a touch of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, popular and hot in trading, and the Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, as there is no place to park below, he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called the Way, the below is called the Instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, translated by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue in the Meiji era.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not mention God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and Monism are the two main schools of thought on the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior people should adhere to, applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It does not start from the preconceived theory of ethics, but rather investigates the actual moral agents' real choices made and observed, and all the moral factors that lead to these choices. It studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as Medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic Ethical Thought, represented by people such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical Thought of the Reformation, represented by John Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli, Modern Ethics (17-18th Century, British Pragmatic Ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th Century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th Century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th Century, German Academy Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th Century, British Utilitarian Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th Century, British Evolutionary Ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., Late 19th Century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, represented by Li Kaer, etc., Late 19th Century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transitional Ethics (Irrationalist Ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of effective inference and proof.
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian aid over the past 30 years since the tragedy of our loved ones, especially since I issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has never stopped since then.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It is your kind deeds that have helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the coronavirus pandemic is spreading globally and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to cease the humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed group - the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have been concluded with a perfect full stop long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian aid, the National US-China Student Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Fund are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often have cross-overs.

Aid money often fails to reach the families of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, following Mr. Ding's suggestion, the "Tiananmen Mothers" established a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Household Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from campuses and society in 1989, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims of the June 4th incident finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th incident.
During this period, China Rights is also independently carrying out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the June 4th donation out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude to Teacher Ding's "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decisions of the refugees and terminate the program within two years, and resume it immediately if needed.
We also express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generous and brave enough to deliver humanitarian aid at the risk of their own for many years.

[Effect] Photo Effect: I took two sets of clothes and the overall effect was quite good, I particularly like this set of pictures~
[Service] Service Details: Because I was pregnant and felt a bit uncomfortable during makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the comments of the rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can energize us to move forward. We will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend all the buddies to come here!
From reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
The makeup artist is very meticulous and will match the look that suits your style, using only top-brand cosmetics.
Mr. Tian Liang needs no introduction, photography is quite a specialty.
The whole studio had an artistic atmosphere, and there were two kittens playing together.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require a six-month wait in advance. My colleagues have shot in Beijing, and the finished product looks just so-so.
We specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, which is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the naturally wonderful moments.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a well-crafted team.
When the photos came out, we and the people around us couldn't stop praising them.
She already recommended her best friend to go there, and her best friend was also very pleased after seeing the negatives.
I hope such studios won't be buried and more people can discover them, take pictures in their own style instead of being generic.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to complete the task as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
The sweet and considerate assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results of the shoot were much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for your comments, Xiao Yu. It's fate that we have met. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust between us has spanned thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you. I hope to have the chance to come to Qinhuangdao again next time.
How do I give money?

A programming novice looking to share their personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
Firstly, it is important to look at the teaching staff of the institution, as if the staff is not strong enough, the training institution will not be of much use. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong staff.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the students from this training institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because you haven't made any introduction about your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with one's own situation.
For example, your profession, age, language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will be related to the field you are studying or want to pursue.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one has a high learning cost, two requires a lot of time, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or you can also find many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through introduction to get free resources, or you can also consult in detail.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also afford certain learning costs and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not take too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, there are also people who answer questions specifically, and there is also help in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my thoughts. As I don't know your situation, I can only give a brief introduction. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further communication.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app.

Every stage of life will come with its own set of difficulties.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face the difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi curators are joining forces to host the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is co-curated by the Saudi Deriyyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China director Fei Yu Tian as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennial is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly acclaimed, some of whom used recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain Series" (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Barkley, the Chief Executive of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that the Biennial will establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain an understanding of Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative communities, and strengthen the interaction between them.
Tian Fei Yu said: "The goal of the biennial is twofold, to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation, as well as to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening period of the biennial, a series of lectures will also be held, where opinion leaders from the art, curatorial and creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered an axe and a shovel.

Want to ask clearly about the reasons.
Bones can be requested to be packaged and shipped separately by the restaurant.
However, the system is not very convenient, all using another one.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continuously help the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare positions to help promote rural revitalization.
Officials from the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources Department introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping the impoverished masses to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of objects for recruiting rural public welfare post personnel at the grassroots level, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations stipulate that job setting should be conducted in accordance with the principles of "setting posts according to demand, assigning personnel according to posts, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and arrangement for on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts.
The address is wrong.
Hi!
Can I cancel my order?
I am placing an order again.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right-wing has had successful times in history, they have not lasted long. Therefore, they are short-lived, shining brightly when given a bit of sunshine and sweating when given a bit of water; they can reach great heights when successful, but suffer greatly when met with setbacks.
However, realistically speaking, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
Third, as for me, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to them and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and its social issues.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I believe that the anti-revolutionary theory will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, political groups mixed up in the mud and sand, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political speculation are not rightists, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left again.
The Left is actually a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I have seen some friends arguing with each other and getting worked up. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics, they are both unreasonable and unyielding.
Don't try to prove that we are right either, and don't even think about getting opponents and skeptics to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a five-cent person, when the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or pursue them but become obsessed.
As the ideals drift further away, even the young dragon slayer can become a villain.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom, and due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese history and culture, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing in China emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, and focuses more on equity and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is certain to persist for many years to come.
Even if you don't understand, just give it a like and you're done.
Nothing more to say, Hua Hua is so righteous.
In the past two years, the US's blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses for "US-affiliated" companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries to impose a blockade on China's chip industry. The direct consequence is that orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip production companies, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains globally.
Nowadays, the chip shortage has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies suspending production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips have been severely affected.
In order to gain control of "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have been taking frequent actions recently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish the Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing US local technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old US technology giant Intel invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened its chip outsourcing business.
While most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and could very likely snatch away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-fashioned American technology giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technological reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdainfully dismissed Intel's decision.
At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a startling statement about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory. Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said that Intel's investment in building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful of Intel's foray into the semiconductor industry because he still remembered the grudges between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak of the world and dominating the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been monopolized by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and tested by one factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor startups have to back away from the huge costs of setting up production lines.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, TSMC was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to secure capital support, Zhang had approached Intel for investment, but Intel, upon hearing that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, evidently had a high opinion of itself and looked down on TSMC, decisively rejecting any investment in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel at the time was looking down on wafer fabrication services.
Unexpectedly, the giants that once looked down upon semiconductor manufacturing services now have to start doing semiconductor foundry work.
Therefore, Zhang feels Intel's entry into semiconductor fabrication is ironic.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stay stagnant.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
To outpace is not an easy task.
Don't wait.

Let's take a look at some of the strangest trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Head, Lay's Price Increase, and Huolala Incident. Public opinion spreads to form a peak, then the index "declines" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look no different from the "Online Sentiment Evolution Model" previously displayed on the Cyberspace Administration of China's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event can present a [peak], [sawtooth], and [cliff] pattern.
【Peak】That is, artificially heating up, quickly rushing into the hot search list, causing public attention; 【Sawtooth】That is, periodic heating up, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff】That is, collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and is ready to take on a new task and rush to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water armies receiving the task and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite war, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgment, which stir emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, let's dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of infection with the Omikron strain - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12th. According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron strain.

After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th the country's first three confirmed cases of infection with the Omikron strain of the virus.
These three students returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month and, as they were all mild cases, were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho strain, the government of Sierra Leone is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, passengers aged 12 and above arriving by plane in Saudi Arabia will be required to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Kumbuzo Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The country's health department conducted whole-genome sequencing of the 12 coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and discovered the three cases of infection.

They received a money pouch.
The order is for Fengzhuo.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain.
The rider from your company told me that the address is too far.
DaMei 360 integrates home decoration.
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No. 156, Ring City South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
When they come into the store, they start a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they hadn't even gone to measure the house. They were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000, and they only showed me a general look at their materials without telling me what brand they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will pressure you to pay a deposit (which you can never get back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big pitfall, I am a living example of being scammed, in a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 did not include water and electricity remodeling, nor did it include any doors and cabinets or bathrooms, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
Besides these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign the contract without explaining anything at first.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, we will bite the bullet and take full responsibility for the customers' problems.
They shift the blame around and there are many details that are too painful to mention. In short, don't choose them because my friend's house they renovated was of poor quality and they charged various fees afterwards.
Damn it, they are the same old Longtou Decoration that used to scam people, now they changed to Da Mei, it seems like they closed down and changed to something else.
Therefore, don't choose such a shady renovation company.
When making a choice in the future, it is important to do some research and consult with people, as renovation is not a small expense.
To ask questions to the merchant, please log in or register first.
Posting of merchant reviews in any form is strictly prohibited. Please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.

So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, then don't cancel the conversation. If the money is not refunded within 5 to 10 days, we will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within less than 15 minutes.

Star Date | The Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Beijing amateur astronomer Anjiu captured a meteor shower of the constellation of Gemini on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the Geminids meteor shower is caused by Asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, with rich colors and plenty of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower will reach its maximum around 3:00 p.m. on December 14, with a ZHR (number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant at the zenith) of 150.
Recommended Index Chart for the Gemini Meteor Shower.
Last year, the "falling stars" of the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the level of excitement will be discounted.
On the fourteenth day of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe during the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can one observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view towards the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it with the naked eye.
Note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiant point of the shower when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens to capture a beautiful "meteor shower" shot, and use a high ISO and the largest aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential based on considerations of stability and continuity.
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or in other words, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TVs are mostly between 55 and 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, laser TVs have seen a steady increase in global shipments and sales, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales for 80 inches and above.
According to ZhongyiKang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for its success in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The SESI Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data has proven that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and can even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
In the current era of increasing emphasis on visual health, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be some truth to it.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short-focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, with little space needed and a small, compact host, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, top-brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat output and less equipment loss, televisions also have a longer lifespan.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the optimal optical design.
In order to shield some ambient light, using microstructured Fieller screen is expensive, the price of 80 inches can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
Additionally, I especially hate when projector manufacturers use diffuse reflection being good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes still can't see it. Even if you take LCD TVs seriously, it is also diffuse "direct" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it won't be able to form an image at all.
What is often overlooked is the hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Select Quality Store currently has no branches.
After adding WeChat for booking the date, the lady will send me the available time arrangements, and the response is quite timely.
Before going, I looked at the shooting works in the store, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
When I arrived that day, I had a brief conversation with the staff about my ideas. She patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with, and finally decided to start the makeup and styling. Before the photographer started shooting, he would arrange some props and guide the action, and he was also very meticulous about the details.
However, it may not be the style I want because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style, which feels very thoughtful.
The repaired film will take about half a month, just wait for the result~
I won the Bawang Meal event for photography again! Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, she chose a black chiffon skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge was the younger brother of the 95s. He felt a little bit inexperienced, and I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores for reply.
Check out Queenie's page too while you're on the homepage!
After filling in my name and phone number at the store, I chose the clothes, including wedding dresses. I tried on three or four sets of clothes and the staff was very patient. After choosing the clothes, I had my makeup done for a long time and the service attitude was good. During the shooting, they taught me how to pose and the photos came out with my face looking big. They said the retouching would take half a month, but I received it in three or four days and it didn't seem to be much different from the original.
[Environment] Overall it is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are approximately three makeup stations, inside of which is a photography studio.
【Service】Warm and attentive.
Hairdressers are very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the poses.
If not satisfied, the photographer will also proactively suggest a reshoot.
[Experience] The styling may be a bit too much, the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
The ends of the eyebrows were also trimmed, making it a bit awkward to go without drawing them on a daily basis.
The photos were taken ten days ago, but the photoshopped results were not satisfactory, and the double eyelids were still quite obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried on two dresses. After looking back and forth, I chose the black dress. The saleswoman said this dress was more of a classic, retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. Both the hairdresser and the makeup artist were very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting the makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, we carefully selected our four favorite shots to be edited. The photographer said he would have them ready within 15 minutes, and the end result was very satisfying.
It has been 3 days without a response... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for each payment.
I now have to pay for shipping every time.
Can I be exempted upfront and then be charged my monthly fee after your investigation is complete?
Is it reliable to buy insurance from Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance broker company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In summary, these three requirements are quite stringent, requiring strength, approval from the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products, Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claim party and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Little Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode, Internet platform products are generally cost-effective because they have fewer operating expenses of business outlets and salaries of business personnel. The payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, which can reduce the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professionalism of the insurance agent, this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can apply for insurance themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have also worked as an insurance phone salesperson at Tencent Weibao (similar to Xiaoyusan, an internet insurance broker platform), responsibly informing everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but people are not. There are no professional practitioners in the internet channel, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the policyholders, the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is Need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought.
It's like getting 600 million from an insurance company for just one dollar (like a dream come true).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) The free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term. If it is only relied on without other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, what can 60,000 do, it cannot solve the problem, and life begins to be naked.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the misdirection of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, in summary, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salespeople.
It is suggested that the topic starter should consider comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products also have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products according to customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody, and let customers rest assured.
Grow together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
During this process, neither the policyholder nor the insurance advisor needs to sign anything, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although purchasing internet insurance lacks the "ceremony" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" assembly line work, but such insurance purchases may also have a fatal problem, that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we buy insurance and choose an "intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

You can just redeem the discount code.
No problem, no need to arrange for a resend, I have already purchased another one, don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and cursing, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we ignore party and faction, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me Facebook friend requests, then posted sarcastic posts, and then tried to post what you claimed were my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only kept tagging me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed. I... just let it go.
Later, I received even more messages from friends about your Facebook account, with a picture of you and comments containing sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my reporting the incident was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, respect between genders is required.
Yes, you can continue with this sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are only caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your plan or continue to make all offensive comments.
Right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, my appearance and figure don't need your judgment.
I don't even think any woman would be willing to let others humiliate her in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me if I was doing okay.
I said it, but you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those without even basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of men.
I have excerpted some of the comments for everyone to consider.
No one should be able to impersonate you for the post you posted yourself.
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile.
Vietnam People's Net - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Ruan Mengxiong stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the novel coronavirus, the number and revenues of Vietnam's digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has increased, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms and take on the task of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, as well as enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies, shared breakthrough ideas and solutions to mobilize and gather all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, work together to promote the country's digital transformation, and Zhu Hui's economic recovery after the epidemic.
When delivering his speech at the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are for everyone, so it is necessary to mobilize everyone to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and businesses.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation should embody the national spirit, and should be mainly driven by internal forces, such as strategies, long-term and decisive factors, with external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help green transformation and develop green energy.
Digital transformation needs to involve the establishment of databases to protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, and national customs, and promote the digital transformation of databases in the banking, taxation, land management and development, and logistics fields.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng called on governments at all levels, organs at all levels and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve systems related to digital transformation, strengthen national governance, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 Vietnam Manufacturing Outstanding Digital Products Award Ceremony and the Opening Ceremony of the Vietnam Manufacturing Digital Products Exhibition.
I have reported and attached pictures, but there has been no response.

Why is it necessary to re-produce?

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service zones have covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have established and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service zone is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capabilities have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for ships and crew, helping them solve the "urgent distress" problem.
The two water-based green integrated service areas built and operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living services, production services and government services as one, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. It will realize the "one-time mooring and multiple services" of ships in the port, making the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of the Chinese think tank, a satellite detected the USS Carl Vinson (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9.
The Balabac Strait, connecting the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the West Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-borne transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, currently sailing in the Pacific, is the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
The USS Lincoln also carried the F-35C Carrier Squadron for the first time, which belonged to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the USS Spruance missile destroyer and the USS Stockdale missile frigate, among others.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) The US Third Carrier Strike Group is assembling around China, with the strongest weapon making a rare visit to Guam on January 17, 2022, with the US Navy's CMV-22B aircraft on board.
According to CNN on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception)
The USS Nevada (USS Nevada), a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Guam Naval Base last Saturday (January 15).
The gathering of the three US aircraft carriers around China, the rare visit to Guam by the most powerful weapon, is seen as a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US has sent its three aircraft carriers to the vicinity of China, the strongest weapon rarely seen visiting Guam. In recent years, China has been building a large number of military facilities in the Paracel Islands.
The picture is Yongshu Island in the Paracel Islands of China.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating the U.S.’s capability, flexibility, readiness, and sustained commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rumble" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomers" the "most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad", which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located on US soil, as well as B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
When talking to friends about Meta's recent plunge of 26%, with a market value evaporating of $251 billion, why did Zuckerberg respond that they are facing unprecedented competition?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Regardless of the functional positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "Ad Network", many Apps integrate Meta's ads, and through Meta's ad platform is to realize monetization.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's privacy policy adjustments, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of ad delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow apps to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies doing business overseas.
Meta has approximately hundreds of employees in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies looking to expand into overseas markets often find that Metas are an unavoidable advertising channel, with most of the money spent going to Metas.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, yet Meta has made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
Agencies across the country are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The era of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just declining revenues, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets not only focus on revenue, but more importantly, on future expectations.
Clearly, the expectations for Meta were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success, with annual revenues of $10-20 billion, it is feeling a strong sense of crisis compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms, with no real safe haven.
Although his several social apps now have a high daily activity and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., he has no confidence in the face of TikTok's rapid development, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
And the concept of creating a universe, which is unattainable in the short term, is very dangerous for Facebook, which is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new tracks. But I think his track selection was wrong, it was a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
