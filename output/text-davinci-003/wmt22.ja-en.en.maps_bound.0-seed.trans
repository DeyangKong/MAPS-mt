When I tried to buy an entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than double for the orange one.
What's the difference?
I couldn't figure it out after researching, so please tell me.
Now there should only be blue.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They look different, but they are the same.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation for Durandal being betrayed by Talia?
Because of genetic incompatibility, Talia and her partner split up and were unable to have a child, so were her genes really that correct?

Since there are things like that, I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
It's creepy when a popular comedian forces laughter even though it's obviously not funny, like "you have to laugh at everything I say because I'm a popular comedian".
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the entertainer's mood, and it won't be pleasant in terms of working together.
It's like the old black companies, that industry is like a sports club, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a bad attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work and say "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until it becomes popular, but it's like a comedian is standing at the top of the difficult job category, even if it's said every time.
It sounds like a justification for the too high position of comedians in the media and society for the beautification of their own careers.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the things related to the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it wouldn't be good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my consent.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse, but the wired version of the mouse arrived and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
Although the topic is more about online shopping troubles than building a PC, I can't agree with it no matter how I think about it, so I will write about it here since it is a well-known place.
The trigger was that I discovered that the MSI wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen (Link to Fish Taku) at the Tsukumo Net Shop Tsukumo Day Sale that started from last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Kotobuki link), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order email normally and the shipping email arrived the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in both of these emails and in the purchase history of my page.
From the order to the shipment, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point since there were no miscommunications or cancellation notifications.
The problem started when an email came a few hours after shipping saying that there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse for a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your response.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note all stated wireless version.
Isn't it unfair to send a different product than what was purchased without any understanding and then demand a refund if we want it returned?
In the end, I want to fight back and refuse to accept a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for marriage or a partner, would you not want to associate with someone whose relationship with their family is bad?

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside was washed away by the typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara District in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The Typhoon in East Japan in 2019 had a big impact on the lives of three households with eight people.
Matsumoto Kōro: "At first it was like 'Seriously?'"
"I couldn't believe it was destroyed so quickly. I felt like it was going to be swept away," said one resident. The only road connecting the Kochi-gahara District, the Kochi-gahara Bridge, was swept away by a typhoon in Eastern Japan, leaving 11 households and 30 people in the district isolated.
The residents forced to endure the water cut continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not open to traffic, to transport the necessary supplies.
Matsumoto Kōro said, "Usually I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry something and walk across the iron bridge, so I felt the convenience of having a car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge was completed a month later, but it was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, leaving the area isolated again for a few days until a makeshift bridge was put in place.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Matsumoto Kōro: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"I thought it would be best to make sure we have enough food for two to three days," We stocked up on canned food and cup noodles, which can be used as emergency food, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "Since you never know when a disaster might strike, I felt again that it's better for everyone to have some supplies prepared. On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with the bridge being washed away."
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Mr. Ryuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Department of Yatsumi Town: "We have announced that we would like to designate October 12th as "Yatsumi Town Disaster Prevention Day" and use it as a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience the Paralympics in Virtual Reality (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
Tokyo held an event on December 12, 2021, where participants could run a digitally recreated course of the Paralympic marathon.
This event was held to allow people to experience the new fun of sports and the appeal of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and people who visited the venue wore special equipment to run on a simulated Paralympic marathon course in the virtual space.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing participants from both inside and outside the country to experience a marathon-like competition while running together, and they can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said... "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun."
"Running through streets of Tokyo like this is tough, but it's really fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure people can enjoy it in places like sports gyms in the future," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The new "Building Condition Survey" system has been established to revitalize the used housing market, and used housing transactions are doing well.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of owning a house has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large scale", and "tower" have become popular, and this has also affected the sharp decrease in the relatively cheaper newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the market share of existing (used) housing in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, aimed at ensuring the safe and secure transaction of used homes (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is knowledgeable about housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property inspection prior to the transaction, which can give the buyer peace of mind.
This can also lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase, and it is said to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for conducting building condition surveys is usually the seller.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system was made obligatory.
In other words, real estate agents in charge of intermediation have the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking overseas, similar systems have already been established in countries such as America and England, where the used market is thriving. There is a risk of concern with seller-led inspections.
Before the sale of a house, there is a system in which the buyer requests a building survey from a specialist called an Inspector or Building Surveyor.
For example, in the case of America, depending on the state, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home transactions.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the "seller"-oriented one.
The sellers will try to show the condition of the building as favorably as possible, and to sell it at the highest price and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyers are carefully examining the survey results and thinking of making the necessary repairs to ensure a safe and comfortable living.
Even with the same inspection, there can be a discrepancy between the objectives and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection mandated by the government is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned project can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections may be conducted with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

As evidence of that ... ..., it's only natural that you can show off your trivia knowledge if you're in Ginza.
Let's introduce you to some interesting facts about Ginza that you'll want to share with someone after you learn them.
Let's go up to Ginza!
First dive into Kanzo
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history everywhere, such as strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As we were walking around Ginza, the sudden silence was broken by her saying, "You know, this used to be a peninsula back in the day."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The Ginza, the epitome of the bustling streets that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" refers to a mint where silver coins were made, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shin-Ryogoku," but when it moved to Kabuki-cho it became known by its nickname "Ginza."
Incidentally, it is said that the area near Ginza was once a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, an inlet called Iri-kawa extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called Edo-mae-shima stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
Then, the soil that was excavated from the moat and the Kanda-yama mountain that was cut down were used to fill in the inlet.
Why not take a look around the area in front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) where there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza City Office, if you are interested?
The "pilgrimage" of Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, Ginza hosts the "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Tour", a pilgrimage known only to those in the know.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, Ryukō Fudōson is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and Ginza Dejichizōson is located on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi at Ginza Terrace.
The Hōtō Inari Shrine and Azuma Inari Shrine, as well as the Toyoiwana Inari Shrine, are located deep in the alley and are not very noticeable, but the Toyoiwana Inari Shrine is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The Seikō Inari Shrine located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachō Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
Inari shrines, which have a fox statue at the entrance, were built enthusiastically in many farming areas to pray for the benefits of a stable rice harvest and abundant harvests, known as "Gokoku Horyo".
This eventually led to the belief that large cities like Kyoto and Edo would benefit from prosperous business, and even in Japan's most bustling district, Ginza, faith began to spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve has been removed and the hole remains open.
He said it was to relieve the pain quickly.
Before treatment, I experience intense pain when I touch my teeth, but will it go away in a few days?
The painkillers didn't work at all...
After a few days, you will feel settled.
I think it hurts the most right now.
Take care.

A male corpse was discovered in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoinagawa River in Moriyama-ku and reported it to 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but his death was confirmed at the scene.
The police are urgently confirming the identity and investigating the cause of death.
Meanwhile, a 70-year-old man was found lying in the Sunagawa River in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disarray in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are quickly confirming the identity and investigating the situation at the time.
Regarding the grant payment for households exempt from residential tax in mid-February, will it be paid if there is one person exempt from the tax in the household?

Korean Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, Posco International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, pending the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the local corporation.
This acquisition will be the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was set at 770.9 billion won, with Posco International investing 50.1% and Hanhock Energy investing 49.9%.
Posco International explained that even in the energy transition era, the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing, and in the hydrogen market, blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the market with green hydrogen, and this is why they decided to make the acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

The balance of fragile supply chains that were overly reliant on just-in-time strategies has been continuing to collapse due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
It is not expected that the supply chain will be stabilized until the end of 2022.

Could the knee pain be osteoarthritis?
Treatment methods vary depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor: Recently, I've been having persistent knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is osteoarthritis.
Editorial team: Does that mean the joint has become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Arthritis can also occur in other joints such as the fingers, base of the thumb, neck, lower back, big toe, and hip.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Professor Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where the two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the joint is surrounded by a "joint capsule".
Editor: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called the synovial membrane, which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making knee movement smoother, which is why.
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, playing a role.
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can deform the joint and cause inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
Although I usually wear basic pajamas, when my pajamas are in the wash I'll sleep in a tracksuit or something!
Are there some heavy smokers who can quit smoking, and some who cannot?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he felt like he should try stopping, so he ended up stopping without making a definite decision.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series that You Can Experience for Real (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Gambling Manga Series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where life is at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tremble... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to try verifying the game of Kaiji that can be played in reality or implemented in planning videos.
The pachinko "Numa" featured in the gambling-themed manga "Kaiji" is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaiji was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was equipped with large traps such as the "Forest of Nails", "Moving Objects", and the "Three-Tier Crucible", making it almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and, in the end, resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to cause the ground to sink and tilt, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held by the wealthy as a pastime, Kaiji and other debtors were made to participate in a human horse racing event, the iron beam crossing.
The debtor must proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people participate, and the top two can win a prize, but there are only four steel beams, and safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this steel bridge walk is highly dangerous, it can be experienced very closely at the Eagle Bridge installed at the home ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge is a single iron bridge that rises to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and beyond it are the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge", which can be reached on foot.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koara Korin released a video on his YouTube channel walking across the Eagle Bridge as "the experience of steel girder crossing in Japan" and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Using 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, the players are divided into two teams: Emperor and Slave.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ear cut off.
After a long and difficult battle, Kaiji realized that his opponent was reading his mind through a device attached to his ear like an earphone, which detected and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature. He then succeeded in disrupting the Rindo-gawa by shaving his ear to its extreme limits and altering his body to abnormal values.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which gained a lot of attention.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to experience the world view through the game?
Gently pushing forward the first step into the new year, a large "Tora no E-ma" was placed in Yamagata Prefecture's Gokoku Shrine. | Yamagata Shimbun
At Yamagata City's Gokoku Shrine, where preparations for the new year are underway, a large votive horse for the coming year's zodiac sign, the Tiger, has appeared.
On the 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from the National University of Arts to create the original drawings for the ema since two years ago.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese painting course instructed by Professor Suehara Toshimitsu, the work of 22-year-old Tsuchiya Yui was selected.
The large e-ma is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya said he painted an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing people forward as they step into the new year.
Stopping in its tracks, the tiger gazing at the cherry blossoms held a wish that even in a rapidly changing world, it could still find the time to appreciate the beauty of nature.
Tsuchiya's designs have also been featured on the ema generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonenki said, "I think we can be a helping hand for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

"Let's Think About Tamano We Want to Keep Living In" - Proposals from Four High School Students in the City at the Workshop: San-Deji Digital, Yamaguchi Shimbun
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
The student representatives from the four high schools in Tamano City are working on a workshop to think about "a Tamano to live in" together.
As part of the survey and policy recommendation project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the voices of young people are collected and proposed to the mayor.
"What makes something enjoyable?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer out loud, such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event held at the Hinode Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed topics such as "interesting town", "livable town", and "town with a sense of purpose" using the World Cafe method, where each person moves to a different "island" with a predetermined theme.
We wrote down each idea on sticky notes and organized them on a mock-up paper.
"Cities with a lot of young people seem interesting," "Public transportation such as trains and buses are essential for livability."
Let's discuss further to see if there are any common points.
"I used to think Tamano was boring, but being able to go cycling by the sea is attractive," said an 18-year-old student from Tamano Commercial High School.
Binnan High School third-year students (18) noticed not only the local issues but also the charm of the area by talking with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to be surrounded by nature."
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the education director in February next year and make an announcement.
The director of the Tourei Center said, "We hope to foster the love of hometown among high school students, and to provide them with an opportunity to actively participate in the development of the town."

How to Find the New Way to Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
I sometimes hear people say that they don't quite understand the technique of balancing the hairstyle after winding it, so it is best to look in the mirror while doing it.
I was hoping to find a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and that I could wrap around quickly, and then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wound up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is made from narrow strips of cloth woven together into one piece, and the whole fabric is in a net-like pattern.
The eye of the net is designed to allow the edge of the stool to pass through.
Therefore, you can wind it up and secure it without connecting the ends.
It is very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, vests without sleeves are popular, but many people will combine them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be convenient to have a scarf like this.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
Get Buck is a movie directed by Peter Jackson.
The Beatles feel so real and life-sized, and it's all so fresh...
Even though it's right before the breakup, it's not the dramatic tension I was imagining.
While trying hard to keep things in order, there was Paul, who was annoying with his "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" attitude, George, who was grumbling with a "But, you know...", John, who was always late and didn't seem motivated, and Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a "Oh, this is troublesome" face.
They didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very common feeling of "It's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had that same feeling. It's like a legendary dismantling or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase and gradually building it up to a famous song while asking each other "How about this?" is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
The scene where a subtle hum gradually turns into a cheerful "Zucha♪ Zucha♪" and lyrics come in is recorded perfectly, it's amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, as it doesn't happen very often.
Of course, everyone is so passionate when they play, so just watching the performance can make you feel happy.
Although it's only one episode out of three, so far my impression is that the main cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.
Despite all their complaints, the four of them seemed to enjoy making music, but when it came to finding a place to perform live, the producer and promoter-like people would start talking in a way like "The Beatles are the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that the band members had no control over the situation.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that might be because Paul is supervising, so there are a lot of scenes where Paul is kind of the villain.

How strong is Guts from "Berserk" in "Demon Slayer"?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't do it.
Do not call out the technique name before executing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you must have felt a sense of responsibility and it has taken away your peace of mind.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I thought I was really suited to sales activities that customers need, so I switched to a different industry and it became much easier to work.
I think that if you can find something you are good at or something you can do within yourself, it will make your life going forward at least a little bit easier.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest so that you can have some peace of mind before considering this.
I'm sure you have daily life as well, so if there are organizations such as company unions or industrial doctors, or consultation windows, it may be good to consult them as there may be some kind of system in place.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have caused major damage in America due to the influence of unseasonably warm weather and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred frequently in the southern United States.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this season caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air below -30°C near 5500m in the sky, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes were occurring one after another in the area.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warnings issued in the winter season reached nearly 150 in one day, a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and strong winds on Friday alone, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that the strength of the tornado was measured by the EF Scale (Modified Fujita Scale), reaching EF3, which is the third strongest out of the six levels, with gusts of wind reaching around 70m/s in an instant.
According to future surveys, there is a possibility that it will be classified as EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, to suit the conditions of Japanese buildings.
The JEF3 tornado equivalent to the one in the US could also occur in Japan with a high probability, with the potential to collapse wooden houses.

According to the Nikkan Sports, voices calling for help were broadcast live from under the "historic largest" debris of the U.S. tornado (Yahoo! News).
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the US, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
It was reported by outlets such as CNN in the US.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
[Photo] In Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado, residents were seen carrying furniture and other items from damaged homes. At least 30 tornadoes occurred in six states, including Kentucky, from the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th.
As for the range of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that caused damage to Missouri and other states in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the largest scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered great damage, the candle factory, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas season, also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remained.
Trapped under a pile of rubble about 1.5 meters thick in the darkness, the woman felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
The live broadcast also featured the sound of a woman singing "Happy Birthday To You" while crying, seemingly to distract from the fear, in addition to the cries for help from another woman.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when the tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people compared it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like an earthquake erupting," he recalled.
The police officer from the Mayfield City Police Department said, "We will continue the search until it is no longer necessary."
He continued the desperate rescue efforts without knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, part of the warehouse of the major online retailer Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The shock of the earthquake was so strong that trains derailed, and highways were blocked due to overturned vehicles.
According to US media, around 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, have been affected by power outages.
I have a low platelet count.

It would be nice if there were "live-in work" options like inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus crisis.

There has been an old saying that there are different opinions about the star-based rating system.
While other countries base their points on a five-star system, Japan's claim is that three stars should be considered neutral and points should be added or subtracted from there.
At the benchmark point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings of "there are elements that need to be deducted" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we use five stars as the basis, then "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest standard" are placed on the same level, so if that is the tendency, then it would be a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since it is actually being used in such a system, it is understandable that you would not want to give three stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, if you try to refute the argument of those who advocate this view with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fits a standard hose size?
The power capacity from USB is about 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
Submersible pumps vary depending on the type, but at least 500W is consumed, so it's impossible.

The Making of a Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the frequency I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too loose so it didn't sound clear, but it was different from the expected station, right?
Here's the main point, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
Why do you think so? Is there such a thing?
Is it okay to delete the Esp for SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a loose file in the appropriate location, then it does not need ESP.
I saw a story somewhere about that, but I can't remember where I saw it...
I understand the risk, so I'm not actually planning to do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is possible technically.
If anyone remembers, I would like to know if it is okay to do it.
Thank you for your post.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" Fried Fish and Shrimp from the Near Sea and Homemade Tartar Sauce | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunchbox "Fried seasonal fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
Hakobune is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes with plenty of vegetables.
Last August, Kousuke Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple opened [their restaurant] with the aim of providing customers with a restaurant-like experience even at home.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
At the market, choose the best fish available at the time.
"We make the batter with as little breadcrumbs as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be felt directly," says Takayuki, and with shrimp tempura, the light and fluffy texture is immediately recognizable.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the self-grown field next to the house or from the direct sales office in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Kiyoshi-san, who has studied French cuisine, adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, the Japanese-Western fusion cuisine offers a familiar and comforting taste, such as rolled omelette, that can be enjoyed by people of all ages (Yumi-san).
The bento box "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it does shake occasionally (not enough to make you feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's safe because the speed was reduced when there were people around, and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze of those around me hurts; it's good to be seen, but it feels like they're saying "you're in the way," and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It is unfortunate that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could be asked to move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
I thought it would be a great ride if there were fewer people, since it was relaxed and I could take my time to enjoy the scenery.
It was a vehicle that gave a feeling of anticipation for the near future, such as whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and it was difficult to ride unless you had a strong heart that could endure the pain of the gaze of those around you.
It was so embarrassing.

If you look closely, you might understand a little bit, but this is an eel bowl without any eel.
Actually, it's "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the answer)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone just eats it with sauce and that the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly... but then I realized that the texture and quantity of the eel is actually important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
The recipe used: Eggplant “Unagi" - Woks of Life (with chili pepper instead of scallions).
I just fried the steamed one in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.

It's terrible because of the mental illness.
Work isn't going well.
I had been considering taking a leave of absence around October, and with a half-hearted sense of responsibility, I had been pushing it off until I finally reached my limit.
I'm thinking of quitting my job and giving up on the IT field.
But I don't know how to live from now on.
I had worked at a supermarket part-time, but I couldn't even do that kind of job (so I was doing part-time engineering work).
Are there any LLLers who have experience with absence or retirement due to illness?

On the 12th, a man was slashed and escaped on a motorcycle in an attempted murder in Saga City Daizai | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and Saga South Police Station is pursuing him as a attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "they are fighting".
The man suffered a 10-centimeter long and 1-centimeter deep wound on his left cheek, but he was conscious.
The man who escaped was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities on the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant at Find Asia Hong Kong) China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities conducted by the local government, but also support the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna (also known as Yunnan Province) in Southwest China is one of such regions.
My sister, Li Wanda, is currently active as an actress. Xishuangbanna is an area bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai people who share roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various countries in Southeast Asia, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture covers only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Mr. Li Min-guo in Sisaket, who is engaged in environmental protection activities, and to hear about the content of his activities.
She and her German husband started environmental protection activities 20 years ago.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The catalyst for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seesapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China, boasting a wealth of biodiversity.
However, economic development was still lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish an industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest was carried out.
He was sent here from Germany to work on the recovery of natural resources and research on biological resources.
And here I met someone I knew through being a journalist, and we got married.
Before that, did Mr. Li not have any interest in nature conservation?
Li, I am from Ceiba Penna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I had to proceed with the project with my husband.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or an especially tall stature, I sometimes see people who have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor was saying.
Aura is not something that can be forced out.
It is something that naturally comes out the moment you have self-confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of self-confidence within them.
High-performance and high-quality rubber boots are handmade by craftsmen.
Free shipping for purchases over 10800 yen.
I was just wondering, is it too detailed to compliment someone's outfit or say that the colors look good?
It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's very detailed.
I've never been told to be specific with praise, so I'm not sure what that means.
What about praising in detail?
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"My heart is blooming with joy after Sakura-san's confession. I accept your offer," I replied, and we began our relationship.
And, in order to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one at a later time?
Establishing them at the same time will complete the procedure faster.
Now it takes about a week to complete.
We recommend opening a NISA account at the same time, as there are no additional fees, so you can use it whenever you want.

【Omakan / Personal Notes】It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
By March, there were multiple CTDs due to multiple factors, and since I couldn't play much around the GW period, it took a long time to identify them, mainly on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have been understood in a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
Main Timing of CTD
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins that log.
For some NPC killing/attacking accumulation: Activates even with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement. Is there a possibility of script overload for this?
For some NPCs, camera work for kill moves can be improved by turning off kill move settings via .ini files, avoiding setting conflicts between DAR and Nemesis. However, the upper limit is not even close to 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoors) During field movement + partial magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use the Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application setting (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could this be due to additional armor or body mesh shader settings misconfigured for some actors/NPCs? Also, although there may be formatting errors in the 2.0 SPID usage default.ini, the result should be as intended and the pre-requisite Perks should be applied to NPCs.
At first, I focused on checking motion/combat mods (.dlls) related to body part attacks and OnHit, and this was the result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French level.
If there happened to be someone in a Japanese environment with the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it.
Most of us are barely managing our mental health.
Nobody around notices it, not even colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person looks like they're having a hard time, but they're still working hard."
However, he is probably pushing himself to the limit mentally as well.
I haven't retired in name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before retiring.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits - After today's visit is over
I have been suffering from bipolar disorder for a long time, so I have been receiving home visits from a nurse (female) at the home visit nursing station I am currently using. I think I have built a very good relationship with her.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also provide necessary things for medication management (such as one-package system), but more than anything, today's home visit made me realize how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illness.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences and gender theory, or something like that, and we laughed.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, or why she got divorced, and so on - is that okay to do in home visits?
Occasionally, I also cross-dress.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that an occupational therapist comes to the visiting nursing station but is given orders in a condescending manner, such as "This is a medical facility, after all."
The visiting nursing station I use is run by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses are really good because they face me, who has a mental illness, on an equal footing and frankly.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There are those who are receiving mental health home visits from nurses, and those who are considering receiving them.
Home visits by nurses are very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, definitely get it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts from my side because they just didn't fit.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I knew it was a false warning, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents are one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a roadmap for a hydrogen economy.
By 2022, it was planned to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulative) and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price for hydrogen was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles had not exceeded the target of 27% (about 17,000 units).
The target for the adoption of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the cost of hydrogen per kilogram is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target.
The Japan Association of Economic and Social Research (Zenkeiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on December 12.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of patents related to hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative), South Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, Keidanren conveyed that "in effect, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are actually in a lower position among the competing countries."
The country-specific patent ranking is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of China (4721).
The Japan Business Federation proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax deduction for investment and research and development costs.
It has been a month and a half since I had surgery to cut the muscles in my finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is slightly swollen and when I move my hand, the affected area feels a stinging pain.

I think it's going to be tough if you don't have an address other than daily payment.
And I feel like daily payments would be difficult without a contact (phone number).
Additionally, an address is required for the line contract.

Even if we manage to get by with manga cafes and daily payments for now,
Securing an address is the top priority, so don't forget.
It is important to sleep on a futon, and simply to open a bank account, use a debit card, or receive government services, an address is necessary.
Although it should be possible to receive welfare benefits without an address, it's probably a rare case.

Is it a crime for a store to sell items at a higher price than the list price?
Today, the PS5 was being sold for 70,000 yen at the store.
It is legal.
In a free market, for example, if the scarcity value of a branded item increases compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the original price.

A meeting on Sunday?
As part of the council reform in Takasu, council members' "communication books" are also being created in the style of a TV program: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Town Council of Takasu is working on unique council reforms, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council elections are aiming for three consecutive terms without voting in order to get the citizens interested.
To inform about the Sunday Council to be held on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Live Giron from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had phrases that evoked popular television shows.

The US has arrived in Ukraine with aid weapons and ammunition, and is also involved in training troops (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that, by December 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The military aid package is worth a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile Javelin.
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's reinforcement of forces around the Ukrainian border.
The US is increasing its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate a response in the event that Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the provision of weapons assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula, the total aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, US National Guard personnel from Florida were sent in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
On the 7th of this month, President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin, and there was a tense exchange regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also indicated that it will impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

We directly question Amano, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission, on the fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that would make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand"!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with Family During the New Year's Holidays"!
This is the technique of lifetime gift and rushing inheritance.
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year, which was a concern, but there is a high possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In a direct interview with former Tax Commission Chairman, Kanemaru Shigeru, he will teach everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques, in order to make it in time for the end of the year and get the most out of your last-minute gifts.
(Keiichiro Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
From wealthy people to company employees in urban areas, lifetime gifts are seen as a "forbidden hand" and "from the perspective of taxing them in an integrated manner with inheritance tax and gift tax, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer".
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because the implication of what is being said is that the rules of succession will be changed, and the "gift before death" which is the orthodox way of dealing with inheritance tax will be prohibited, leading to a large increase in inheritance tax.
The golden rule for reducing the highly progressive inheritance tax is to reduce the taxable assets.
Lifetime gifts, which are the strongest trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in one of the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although it was not included in the Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, the policy towards integration was re-established with more detailed wording such as "review the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
Former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Masaru Amari, the former chairman of the Tax System Research Council, said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to ensure that the tax burden remains the same regardless of when the asset transfer is made, without losing any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration. If the amendment is made at the fastest speed, the remaining chances for lifetime gifts will be reduced to three.
Even without that, it seems certain that in the near future, a major step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how will the rules for inheritance and gift taxes specifically change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcasted on terrestrial television starting January 10th, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
【Photo】Kaname Yamaya as the heroine. Based on the manga of the same name by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the burden of the past.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Risae, is played by Yamayagi Kanjū.
Riso, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Kairi.
Kaori, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but could Kairi be a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yuudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
Those who were unable to watch FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already watched it can gain a deeper understanding of the work by watching the complex psychological portrayal of Kairi and Risae, as well as their struggles and changes.
I am happy if the original fans can also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

After winning a game with only three passes in the NFL, what were the players feeling and how did they experience it? (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News)
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since 1974 Week 3 when the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in the NFL over the past 50 years.
In 1974, the Bills had an unprecedented genius running back, O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to exceed 2000 yards in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the runs of Simpson and another RB, Jim Brownston.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada and has the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s, and it was snowing before the game.
The Bills, being local, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
There were 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not a poor performance.
There were four red zone penetrations in the 10 offensive series and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three attempts, they only managed to score one field goal for three points.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
It is 18 yards to the goal.
At 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He then threw a pass towards tight end Dorson Knox in the endzone, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs was running a shallow cross to the right side and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen threw two passes targeting the end zone, both of which he missed the two receivers.
The fourth down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown on the third down.
You need to get two first downs in the play.
Since it was still two minutes before, if they had gone for 4th & Short, Allen's ability to make a run of his own should have come alive.
Smooth and glossy hair.

It's time to choose three items that are often kept in the kitchen for a long time and need to be replaced or thrown away (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
Even if you replace it frequently, it is probably the sponge that is not replaced as often as recommended.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if a kitchen sponge is sterilized in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (even so, it is still recommended to sterilize it in the microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend changing the sponge once a week to maintain cleanliness.
Cutting board
The US Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when the cutting board starts to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, as bacteria can multiply.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Clean the surface with clean water and either let it air dry or lightly pat it dry with a clean paper towel.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cuts on the lips or spills of drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged Righteous General Guan Yu, Submitter: Builder Yu Jin
Submerged General Guan Yu: "Oi, Yu Jin!"
Yu Jin said, "Wuss."
"Yukin won't die even if 30,000 arrows come raining down."
"Wuss."
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die."
"Wuss."
"You won't die even if you get swallowed up by the muddy waters of the Han River."
"Wuss."
"So can the underwater bridge withstand a water attack for three quarters of an hour?"
"Oooh-soo-soo"
"So let's practice so that we can endure until the next battle of Fancheng!"
"Woo-hoo!"
"Is it a promise?"
"I understand!"
"Someday you might be killed by Cao Cao and I won't even know!"
Saying that, the loyal general returned.
Of course, there's no way we're doing underwater bridge three-minute drills! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and submerge them in a cage.

Help, FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed on without blinking.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end even after an hour.
Possible causes could be that the USB memory is too old or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you overslept and become sluggish?
Are there any other similar causes?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! I was with an acquaintance.

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to have brand-name items.
I can carry something that is not eye-catching, but I cannot carry something like Louis Vuitton with its iconic monogram and the letters "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to choose something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one you're talking to in a rude way?"
If they start to say that it doesn't matter because they are foreigners, it's best to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I even dream of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly good probability.
I lived abroad for a while, and the Japanese people who went out there, including me, disliked the Confucian hierarchical customs. There were quite a few people there, and I think they misunderstood that we could say whatever we wanted to the locals.
If it looks like it to Westerners, I think it's without any malice, more like a kind of spoiledness or a friendly attitude.
Even with my friends who are from Europe and America, I usually call them by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, there are moments when I'm a bit unsure which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's just friends.
It's probably just normal behavior, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say something now.
Can you talk to me according to Japanese rules because this is Japan?
Incidentally, my white friends who naturalize always raise their glasses higher than the younger people when they toast at parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if I do it that way, I won't be treated strangely by people younger or older than me, like a Japanese person.
Regardless of personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details in Japanese culture.

Thank you for 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created subreddit had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, there were only 25 subscribers, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
For those of you who subscribed to this sub today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let us know in the comments section where you heard about this sub! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Since there is currently only one person creating threads, it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.
Even if you don't start a thread, your comments will be encouraging.

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of the wording, but I can understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I'm just saying this based on how I feel, so it might be a good idea to ask other people as well).
It is common to see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it is a small-scale company, I feel that it is well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it is a matter of whether they can reach the point of understanding the subtle nuances of the Japanese language even after studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, it might be better to look for someone else.

Consideration: Training is the battle in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba".
"Equal exchange of effort" is a human praise <Anime "Yukaku-hen" Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes Kimetsu no Yaiba particularly unique among recent shounen manga is the abundance of training.
Generally speaking, it is conventional wisdom that training arcs, where there is no battle and the protagonist trains day and night, are not popular with readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE" only touched upon the two years of training that the Straw Hat Pirates underwent when they separated, and the rest was glossed over in a grandiose manner.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is the eccentricity of the places it visits, but staying in the same place and training doesn't always go well together.
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began with him kneeling before Tengen Uzui, who had saved his life, and begging for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, to which Tengen said, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are only forced to submit to the strong by power...
While saying that, it was Giin's kindness to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps (even though he is a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
Tanjiro's first contact with RinTaki was when he was asked "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" and RinTaki immediately judged him for taking too long to answer.
Among fans, it's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that has become a popular topic of conversation.
However, walking with a sister who has become a demon carries the potential that a moment may come when such a decision is forced upon them.
It can be said that this is an initiation into practice, starting from the right attitude.
Rin Takadzukuri orders Tanjiro to take him to Mt. Hagaromo, even though Tanjiro is still an inexperienced novice, and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls such as air holes, stone-throwing machines, and traps, and it seems like you will die before you even start your training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he can detect the faint smell of a trap set by a person, and somehow manage to avoid it, which is barely enough to be called the "protagonist correction".
Nevertheless, it is the essence of Kimetsu that allows Tanjiro to say "But I can't suddenly become so powerful that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is only being able to use the "power and skills that have been honed up to that point" with their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", where those who put in effort are rewarded accordingly and those who do not put in effort are not rewarded, is a humanistic praise that is different from the supernatural power of a demon with no basis, and is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work.
Is this old?
I still sleep on the floor with a mattress, futon, and duvet, instead of a bed.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to make the most of the room, it's better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Is it annoying?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time, but have to work multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "stubbornness".
I think of it as a gambit, where we try to get a greater benefit than the minimal effort we put in.

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Department" integrating home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into the Set Division, the company announced on the 12th that the name of the division will be changed to DX (Device eXperience) and this will be reflected in the year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the intention is to enhance user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division, which was formed by integrating the CE and IM divisions, consists of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects the company's mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
They also emphasized their intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
The strategy of creating synergistic effects across the entire company and building a foundation for differentiated products and services by surpassing the boundaries between organizations was also reflected in the name with the establishment of the integrated leadership system.
Already, Samsung Electronics is conceptualizing a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to enable users to freely use content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Although it is a matter of preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I would like it to be expressed in a heavier and stiffer way.
They lie in wait, their jaws primed and only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
The larvae of the damselfly always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch their prey, exposing only their circular head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The mantis larvae lie in wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Are we looking from an ant's perspective?
I wonder.
If we translate armoured heads as "disc-shaped heads", I think the part about "a giant monster wearing a helmet on an ant's scale" will disappear...
24 vehicles collided in Aichi, and the truck driver had no pre-existing condition; was it due to carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in which 24 cars collided, had no chronic illness and that the accident was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing an initial collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect had temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura was not suffering from any illness and it appears that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are conducting searches of the premises and investigating the situation at the time in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to its focus on only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●The Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started even before the match!
In a nutshell, this four-volume series is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but it is important to note that it is not just a volume that only depicts the matches in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes that are quite different from before, but that doesn't mean it's boring.
As the tension of the start of the century's war gradually increases in the work, it certainly leads to the excitement of the readers, and I can't help but marvel at the fact that even this period was carefully calculated for the production.
And before the important finals, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxuriousness as a battle card, what I like is that before the match, Ramenman faces the Kinnikuman poster and says, "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!"
He tried to hit her with a chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, caught the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with them silently glaring at each other before they parted ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a passionate debate about Kinnikuman.
Seeing this makes me unable to help but think of their far-off future successes!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now, that this is what it means!
The fight between the two ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of God's luck towards Kinnikuman!"
That is the line.
This could be seen as a grand statement about the work itself. I think readers of Kinnikuman have been feeling that the protagonist will never lose, and somehow manages to win even without relying on his own strength.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei had already taken the initiative and driven home the point that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one sentence, the readers thought, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman can defeat Robin with just his strength?"
How?
It will surely stimulate our imagination with its unpredictable development, and from a writer's perspective, this is like a line of dialogue where Yudetamago Sensei, the creator of the work, has imposed a restriction on himself.
Wow, this is an amazing thing.
I definitely think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aobayama in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "We were surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find this place."
She was saying that it was very beautiful and she felt relaxed.
The illuminations, which were first planned to provide a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, are lit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there will also be a Christmas event with activities such as serving a hot pot and screening a movie.
I think there are only a few people who can read through documents in order.

It is easier to understand and apply if you learn from Linux rather than starting with something abstract like Docker.
It's quite tough to just skip over that and understand everything all at once.

Yonezawa-based Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association will broadcast online delivery and PR of agricultural and livestock products from Yonezawa via Yamagata Shimbun.
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns and JA in the Okitama area, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce", which distributes videos and sells products over the internet.
The Yamagata Aien Bujotai group made a remote appearance in the first "Nationwide Collaborative Minato (Minaato) Market TV" event planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, delivering the area's attractions along with local specialties.
The "Okitama x Minato Kaikou Project" collaboration between the Okitama region and the Port District enabled a store to be set up, which was broadcast from the Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranomachi, Yonezawa City.
Kokuda Mikai, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier", wore a stole from the Yonezawa weaving brand "Nitorto (Nitorito)" and introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
We also delivered a report on the Imoni Party with Ai no Bushotai.

Misfortune this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
The computer is powered on at this time.
2.) Upon returning to the room after a while, I noticed a sound like a Pink Rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for now.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) It won't start.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will come on for a moment and the fan will move, but it will soon stop.
After that, say nothing.
Even after unplugging the power cord and trying again, it still only turns on for a moment.
4.) I tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, and removing all other parts, but it still won't boot.
5.) Since there was a sound like "bubbububububu" as if something was hitting the PSU, I suspect that it might be the cause.
Later, try finding an extra ATX power supply and give it a try.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work...What should I do?
Should I change the case and the motherboard together?

The 2021 Most Used Emoji Ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News

It's said that the top one accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
The crying-laughing emojis at 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are really easy to use, aren't they?
Of course, let's enjoy the fun and happy times, but also the times when we mess up!
Even when feeling helpless and hopeless, wouldn't there be few people who use self-deprecating language?
On the contrary, those who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are extremely rare.
I want you to maintain that style.

I haven't used it before, but it seems like Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear the reviews.
Large garbage (paid) and additional information> Municipal collection box (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it used.
Update: Mercari and Hard Off
Have you ever sold anything on flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It might be a wise choice to sell while it can still make money.

The broken printer that no one will take, the old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's being put off for now.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, paper money can be exchanged, but coins cannot be exchanged.
Commemorative coins contain gold, so they have value.
Even if they haven't done anything wrong, there are times when you can dislike them, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes because we are human.
"There are people who dislike (someone for no reason)," that's what it's like to dislike someone.

Don't you feel discriminated against because you don't have a girlfriend?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that people are judged by their appearance.
Because you can't show your inner self.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduation?
I wear it as casual wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, she was wearing pajamas, haha.
Is it possible for someone to become a Riajuu at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
Though all sexual desire and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.
Men's Volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's Fencing, Freel finishes in 4th place and does not win a medal.
The Japanese men's volleyball team, Ryūjin Nippon, has advanced to the final 8 for the first time in 29 years! Coach Nakagaki: "It was a big goal."
When I lost the third set with a double referee challenge, I thought it was all over, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
I think they were a cut above the opponents we faced in the semi-finals, so why are they in the third-place game?
I would like to plant a tree that will provide privacy in the garden, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
Ideally, I would like a evergreen tree that is easy to care for and preferably produces fruit.
Thank you in advance.
To get fruit on a feijoa tree, it is best to plant other fruiting trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby to help it bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to have between us in order to live together without any financial difficulty?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to end the cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is better to hire a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal shops, and have a wedding and reception.
There are no benefits to living together.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played the arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-released legendary rare (^_^;)
Is there any kind of card game like Ganbaraging that can be played as a hobby?
I think yes.
