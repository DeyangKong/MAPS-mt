At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students took the lead in singing and their research results opened up people's minds.
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University yesterday evening, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended, such as using air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for the source of haze.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, covering various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Health Checkup Doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the Biomedical Engineering College demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-end biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"Just take a breath and this device can detect your body's health condition from the components of the exhaled air."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, as its target. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lights: High-powered eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new perspective on the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
Many diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room due to inadequate early detection and removal.
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity, and the shadowless rate according to the surgical needs and personal preferences at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air-washing your hands: Saving water and looking cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just by standing on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean!"
The results of the visible color reaction and bacterial residue tests prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold medal.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency medical help is needed.
If I really suffer from heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then we only have four minutes of life window, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing there helplessly and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrible.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, with cardiac arrest being the most dangerous.
In the United States, 15% can be saved on average.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is the first response from the founder of Entrepreneurship, Lu Le.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person.
I find that few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
It might even save someone's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed accomplished!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The shrimp dumplings for 13 yuan is only one?!
Never tried it.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
It costs 13 dollars?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver the food, and this time I only got one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
I clearly saw that the code I entered was valid before.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in all senses of the word.
But if you were to say that this movie isn't a highlight, then that's not true either, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. One kind can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and another kind can make you angry after watching it. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creature from a classic novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there are any metaphors implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a pile of crap.
First of all, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an elderly neighbor to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
Then the old man disappeared without a trace.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small gangsters of the Island Flying Club easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering the steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck drivers around could not be found.
The technology is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and suspected of criminal activity become a police auxiliary?
Faced with usury, why didn't they report to the police? In the movie, the police even asked if there was any difficulty.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then has to arrange to sleep outside the room door without finding the hotel owner?
This kind of inexplicable plot is filled throughout the entire film, and due to its outlandishness, I feel pain when I recall them.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, it's just an abominable patchwork.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep doubt of yourself, why did you go to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays.
For most people, they are already very familiar with the tropes of various films. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romance film, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town youth who loves to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
For example, the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon acted in, which was burned but still able to sing, cannot be used to open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female lead, who obviously isn't mentally challenged but acts like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to her acting or the director's requirement.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to give the audience a headache?

Inspect the concrete module production and processing equipment. Introduction to Zhengzhou Well Wall Brick Module Equipment:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well brick machine machinery, and well wall wall module machinery, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have quality products, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspect the concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Check the production and processing equipment of the concrete well module, the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin Inspection Well Block Brick Machine Equipment is widely applicable to new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have grooved structures on the top, bottom, left and right sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of well wall is far superior to that of flat masonry formwork.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being assembled, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are penetrated. After the cores are poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Both the horizontal and vertical modules are equipped with grooves for inserting reinforcing bars, and the horizontal lapping reinforcing bars and vertical inserting reinforcing bars correspondingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display monitoring mechanical operation of the entire process, to achieve the ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic transmission and double cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment cloth box advances the model box demoulding, the storage bin door closes, the automatic conveying pallet, all completes independently by the hydraulic system, thus achieves the reduction mechanical wear and tear and the maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical appliances, sealing parts, hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table line cutting and molding are weldless, so that the filling box can move freely and guide, and the mechanical wear is greatly reduced.
Reduce the mold load, fill and two-in-one compression amplitude, adopt integration, full synchronization, table vibration, mold vibration, to ensure the vibration solid effect.
The mechanical vibration machine of the well wall module, computer automatic control of the amplitude according to the cost performance of the raw materials to adjust the amplitude, no wear and tear braking, thus prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The wall module has both automatic and manual control functions.

Chongqing Vocational Schools are piloting a modern apprenticeship program, where students are considered quasi-employees of the enterprise upon enrollment.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, a tripartite agreement shall be signed by apprentices, schools and enterprises. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific posts, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the cultivation of the educational system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program. The top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Following the principle of piloting first and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, and enhance the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Although Omecamtiv Mecarbil has a strong transmission power, most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pyle said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more vulnerable to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported Omicron Rho variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients had severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's still early days, and we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this pandemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Deltat still being the main strain of the coronavirus worldwide, cases of the Omikron strain are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the pandemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Haoden Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Commentary: What can be done to rescue abducted children?
If we use the famous public welfare advertisement "No buying and selling, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for abduction, collective prevention and control, and the whole people against abduction, make the abduction behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to quickly locate abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app, "Reunion", I feel a warmth and comfort.
The new technology means not only has a name of "literature and art" full of feelings, but also is properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of enforcing the law against child abduction is to locate the abducted children and protect their safety and freedom.
Secondly, comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed with many "big words", from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before a trafficking case is cracked, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Weighing the importance of the matter, under the urgent purpose of "rescue", topics with much debate and controversy such as "whether child trafficking should be punished by death penalty" can be put aside for careful discussion; however, the rescue of trafficked children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute of delay in a child abduction case increases the difficulty of solving the case and puts the child further away from their parents.
In this situation, taking effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "rescuing abducted children" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from families to society.
For example, a common case is when a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a considerable awareness of safety.
Both parents taking turns to rest or placing the child under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, those who purchase trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
An individual act of crime is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
With the high starting point of punishment and the heaviest punishment, under the trend of "leniency", the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to the crime with heavier punishment.
Even today, there are still many cases of human trafficking occurring every year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about parenting and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should keep up with the times.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the "market" of trafficking is widely present, traffickers are driven by their greed and constantly innovate their methods, forming a "battle of law" situation with law enforcement, anti-trafficking actions will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences with three aspects - ideals, beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leadership and party theory - to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the whole meeting in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the conference, the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial party congress to learn, integrate and understand, enhance the ideological, political and action awareness of upholding the "two establishements" and achieving the "two maintenances", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to firmly follow the Party, and to use their youth to contribute to their responsibilities and responsibilities.

Actually, I don't know if it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigatable
I hope you understand.
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
It's gone, thank you.
Yes, a new delivery rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
Waited for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the first-pressed olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3% is refined, or known as "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels.
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent with a light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil obtained by extracting and refining it from the oil residue through the dissolution method.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olives, like grapes used to make wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive growth is
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow crops sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similarly climatic countries far in the south latitude such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
The months for harvesting olives are
From March to June every year, it is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for fruit picking (freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also expressed his plan to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun-chung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democracy Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening remarks on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must cooperate.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Commissioner Tang Feng delivered a video statement of the "National Declaration", emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the pandemic, nor do we have to take down fake news to win the battle.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant keeps delaying the delivery time for some reason.
Originally it was #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I'm not calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to deliver to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
We waited for a meal for half an hour.
Delivery has not been made by #PRS_ORG#.
I want to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hi, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a price that is similar to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level shots" are actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold up, and it's difficult for experts to control.
The logic and underlying message behind them is - tennis is so hard, they know you won't be able to learn it, and they know you won't want to buy an expensive one, so they give you a cheap one to fool you. You'll play it twice and then you won't play it again, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to me to buy the expensive ones then, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly used racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not well-known, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one for 500 or 600 yuan is good enough, and a used one for 200 yuan. Isn't it great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket?
It is friendly to newbies, but it becomes useless after the novice stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Do I need to ignore the previous one?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing from the delivered food, and the saliva chicken was also raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I should take it for no reason, please cancel it.
My order requires delivery, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with slightly plump bodies when it comes to dressing and matching.
Girls with a bigger body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal any fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you divide your outfit into three parts - top, skirt, and long socks - you will naturally appear taller. Using different colors for each part will create a slimming effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover your body fat, and elegant black skirts are the first choice for slightly plump girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Avoid giving people the impression of obesity when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should never wear tight mini skirts. Additionally, tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, black tights or mesh tights (the kind with thin grids) should be worn. Choose a soft-textured printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the flaws of a plus-size girl.
Of course, girls with a bit of extra weight also have to be careful when wearing short skirts.
For plus-size girls wearing a short skirt, it is recommended to choose a top in the same color as the skirt, which will make your plump figure look taller.
Pairing a mini skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN fashion combination for summer!
If you are top-heavy but have slim legs, we recommend choosing a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your belly, but it can also show off your best features.
An A-line skirt will be slimming, and is more suitable for chubby girls. For the top, choose something more fitted to create a layered look that will be more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can be tried by plus-sized women.
Girls with a bit of extra weight can also look fashionable.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of "slightly fat girl" one day earlier 😄

The girl, who was the target of arrows for her sister's charity, said "It's still better than flesh wounds." - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a "target" to raise money for her sister went viral on social media.
Photos show that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a slightly higher wooden board, which reads "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow", indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows after payment.
The behavior has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls warned for street "arrow target" fundraising
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. On the other board in front of her, her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc. are written.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens sympathize with it.
We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers.
When the police from the nearby Tianshui police station were interviewed by local media, they said that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising donations for her elder sister Jijiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 in treatment costs, they could not think of a good way to raise funds, so they resorted to this behavior.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were involved, one as the target and one as the assistant, but neither of them actually shot the arrows. No one was found shooting arrows during the process, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police investigation, the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The responsible person stated, "This type of fundraising for attention is not encouraged."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the station.

This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with good workmanship and materials, so you can rest assured of the brand!
The price of Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is still not expensive.
I personally think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. The game effect is smooth, and I can play most games with a high frame rate. It's very smooth, and LOL is no problem. CSGO is also easy to handle, and most AAA games can be played.

The red on the back is a very nice wine color, not too flashy. Overall, it exceeded my expectations and was worth the purchase. It's also suitable for girls.
I started using Acer Nitro Knight two years ago and it has been a great value for money with its excellent quality.
I also recommend this product to my friends around me!
I have already purchased three machines from this series!
It has a beautiful appearance and good configuration.
I wanted to wait for the 418 bank promotion to buy something for my nephew, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
The price-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back to review after a period of time.
A brand new, cost-effective gaming laptop with a great design, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a computer for a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can do 3D design work performance.
He said it was great for what I bought for my son.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand, I recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
No doubt it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a very popular article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for the Gold Medal in the Olympics". It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
Seemingly a joke article, it also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, which behind represents the powerlessness of current project management work.
Meanwhile, personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional certification) registrations every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified personnel has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing working environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does obtaining a PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on and on; unclear member division of labor, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to deal with it, cross-departmental assistance communication not smooth, and the project difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting brings the online course of "R&D Project Manager Training Camp".
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" Online Course. This is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D-type enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to the enterprise.
Words are not enough, let's take a look at what other students say about the course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtianhua experts team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

Jiexin advocated rational consumption to consumers on the eve of Double Twelve - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" carnival nationwide network payment business transaction amount reached 17.7 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The various discounts and red envelopes, as well as the eye-catching live broadcast of goods, have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumer boom makes people marvel at the increasing consumer power of the people, on the other hand, we have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Elderly and young people have relatively low financial literacy, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their happy life with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, CreditEase has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young groups, help them establish rational consumption concepts, plan reasonable consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumption and borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When spending, it is important to plan ahead and be mindful of your budget, and make sure to pay back on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies, to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis triggered by the embargo imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
Tensions in diplomacy have severely affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar first.
Gulf Arab states resolving differences to restore relations with Qatar is a requirement of unity for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' enterprises have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the Gulf Union, while proposing measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said to have the loudest exhaust sound of all supercars in New Town!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, and the road tax for a year is around thirteen thousand Malaysian Ringgit. It has four-wheel drive, so why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it can go?
I don't know either. Data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That means when myvi just reaches 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it and the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, it's really uncomfortable (but kind of cool)!
Fuel cost per kilometer is around RM1 (Car owners don't really care).
Practice getting on and off the vehicle, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deafened after getting off (but it's still awesome).
The body of the car is too big, so it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, and I'm afraid it will be knocked when the car next to it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road.
Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just a few minutes before that day, a million dollar 911 and a ten million dollar Chiron supercar were crashed overseas!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Resonating the spirit of the university with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and value pursuits that have been accumulated over the long-term development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious. Global educational competition, technological competition and talent competition are intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines, not only does it demonstrate the confidence and determination of our country in transitioning from a higher education power to a higher education strong country, but it also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we quickly build a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, and achieve "overtaking" in a relatively short period of time, while still having a certain gap?
In addition to having a firm goal, self-confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catch-up with the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to be aware that it is impossible for all universities to be the same in building a world-class university. Each school must show its own characteristics and features while playing to its strengths.
The characteristics of education should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, educational traditions and resource endowments of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we emphasize three characteristics in our education: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science and education, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of the educational system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a wide Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Cultivation, Discernment, and Practicality", and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit of "Incorporating rivers and seas, opening up true and profound virtue, leading the people to the future, and building our nation" constitute the core of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", expressing the quality concept of learning from world-renowned universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and development, and breaking the old and establishing the new; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the Chinese socialist cause, deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the current era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Iranian President: If Sanctions on Iran are Lifted, Nuclear Negotiations May Reach an Agreement - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency reported from Tehran on December 11th (Reporters Gao Wencheng and Wang Shoubao) that Iranian President Rouhani said on the 11th in the Iranian capital Tehran that if the United States lifts sanctions against Iran, a "good agreement" can be reached in the negotiations on the comprehensive Iranian nuclear issue.
According to a statement released on the website of the Iranian President, Lehi said at a meeting with the Iranian ambassadors to neighboring countries that Iran has demonstrated its negotiating sincerity by submitting proposals to the other parties involved in the Iranian nuclear agreement.
If the US side is determined, the path to an agreement will be clear.

At the same time when NFTs were quickly gaining popularity, the cryptocurrency community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asian region, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a transaction volume of over 3 billion US dollars to date.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, almost catching up to "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single characters. In addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about my friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway was the choice of industry for investment, namely the selection of investment targets. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good future growth potential, considering the industry's optimal growth state in the next 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the track being flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on for the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Strategy is about "doing the things right", which means doing things correctly.
Strategy is about "doing the right thing", which is doing the correct thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is room for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in terms of increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of increasing the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been recognized as a legal currency by a nation or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in eight years, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market, further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.

On May 23, Xinhua News Agency reported from Washington (reporter Xu Jianmei) that more than 130 Asian American groups submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu-Kong introduced that according to the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014, among the three universities, the admission rate of Asian-Americans was the lowest relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu told Xinhua reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.
Currently, the three universities complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was established in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups participating in the appeal, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups are also included.

That's the ordering hotline, they don't know anything.
Is there a phone number I can contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the family of the house owner, Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the delay of signing the real estate contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally finding a house he liked and paying the deposit, Mr. Lu had the money ready to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell, leaving him feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
After the court's examination, it was found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and the failure could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the breach of contract liability.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind us to exercise necessary caution and attention in the course of transactions.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement on Saturday (December 11th) expressing that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, acting against democracy in the name of democracy, stirring up division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, pursued "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale lethal weapon' for the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, Brazil and other countries. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden government is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes to organize the summit.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democratic summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is showing its pathology, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth differentiation becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, U.S. President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and buffer and resist the forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "at a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has promised to launch a year-long action after the summit on democracy, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.
Rich Chang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Ambience: Average [Service Bell] Service: Food served quickly. My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Cake". The Mala Cake is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the cuttlefish is very chewy.
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the service is warm.
It's been a while since I last came to Richeng, and the fruit lao is still so delicious & the ingredients are plentiful. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time and it was just the kind of soft flour texture I love from the south!
The braised rice was cooked to the perfect degree of dryness and the portion was very generous. The signature wax paper chicken wings were as good as ever, the soup was also good, and the kale was also handled well.
Delicious taste, warm service, good meat.
The Rochang Old Store has been a popular presence on the internet for many years, with its small building and wooden floor in Dongdan.
We always have to wait a long time to get the claypot rice at the entrance, and the claypot is cracked...
It has been several years since I last visited Richeng. The rise of various small shops has dispersed the customer flow of Cantonese cuisine.
It's rare to have a seat available when you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the staple food is great.
RICHANG Delivery.
The food served this time was a bit disappointing.
Three-Cup Chicken: There are a lot of side dishes, and the chicken is a bit scarce.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the underlying salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness. Everyone can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label Whiskey drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would be a waste of its rich flavor.
So how do you drink Red Label Whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction from the editor.
The Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
Upon tasting, it is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This beverage can be enjoyed either on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label Whiskey has entered the Chinese market, and in order to suit the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label Whiskey mixed with Coca-Cola, Sprite, or Fanta has become a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sour taste, can bring visual pleasure and add to the drink to dilute the taste and change the taste.
Red whiskey + sliced lemon + rock sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Hong Fang has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. You can try them as a reference. Hopefully, this introduction can help everyone.
Education Thinking: How to Make University Exams Fair for Both "Academic Elite" and "Academic Underachievers" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In college campuses, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who do not put in effort may be able to pass the exam with a last-minute cram session. If they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "underachievers" can pass the exams without much effort and even get high scores; "overachievers" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores in exams, create a "strange situation".
From this point of view, it is not without reason that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect the problems in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have been to university are well aware that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try various ways to get exam questions from teachers, strive to get the scope of the exam, and even sneak in cheat sheets during the exam and ask the teacher for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the qualification of a university exam depends more on the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be divided into more specific areas, and many major courses focus mainly on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams examine.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is basically composed of subject basic theories and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned in college 20 years ago is still being studied and is still the focus."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the exam is usually composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate to compose the test paper. The exam marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that it can overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But to draw up a set of questions that meet the actual needs of teaching and learning, the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and the teaching situation should be comprehensively mastered to comprehensively analyze the students' learning level, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of the exam, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time innovate the design of the type.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exams, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will eventually affect the effectiveness of university education.
The school of Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values the student's suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require teaching units to organize teachers to carry out research and course final examination comparison self-examination, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine the score evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an issue that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will also be more in line with reality, so that both "academic elites" and "laggards" can get what they need.
If you cannot change the location of the branch for me, can you change it to delivery?

Mrs. Jin's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) currently has no branches.
Before taking the photos, because we didn't plan our time well, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
The staff of Queen, whether it be advisors, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first time doing makeup formally, wow~ I can't believe it, I can look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with makeup and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor shoot was taken at Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel cold. During the shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and if there was something slightly wrong, they would immediately help us fix it.
Photographers are also very humorous, and they feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw a lot of cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, directly from the 24 photos in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at that time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't quite right, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
I flipped out the photos my sister took before and compared them. I'm really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin's studio for wedding photography!
Suite Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you all happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, the bureau director, Kalu Amunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will receive their certificates when the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the 10-month-long coverage of a web media's alleged paper printing issue in Sabah.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the pandemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah Paper is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Kalamunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then return to Sabah to immediately start the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20th) to deliver it to the applicant.
We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to pick up the birth registration forms.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 copies of the birth certificate so far this year.
Waiting from more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost here?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Good, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Junior High School in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Middle School Admission Examination for Special Talents was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, the districts of Beijing have compressed the proportion of special talent students admissions, making the competition for special talent students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students in the district this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students who have physical education, art, and science specialties and register online are eligible to participate in the special enrollment examination.
To facilitate students to take the tests nearby, Dongcheng District continues the arrangement of last year's tests, setting 1-2 test sites in each school district, for a total of 13 test sites.
Examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and time periods are divided by hours. Students will enter the examination points in different examination areas and take the examination according to the time period.
On May 23rd, the District Education Enrollment and Examination Center announced the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes?

The key is that I haven't had dinner tonight.

The President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina: firmly believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics in a special period - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency reported from Sarajevo on December 11th that the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic Kvesic, recently expressed that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics successfully in this special period.
Recently, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina Ji Ping met with the President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kvesic Kvesic, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Krzysztof Czwojdzinski positively evaluated the Poland-China relations and said that he had visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and was deeply impressed by the excellent organization of the Chinese side. He firmly believed that China had the ability to host the Winter Olympics in special times. The Polish side is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Polish Olympic Committee is actively organizing the participation. The Polish side hopes to use this as an opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese side in the field of sports.
Ji Ping stated that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here, and in two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open, presenting the world with a simple, safe, and exciting event.
It is expected that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events, athlete training, etc. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can "move forward together", and wish the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina achieve good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the 10th Annual Best Athlete Awards Ceremony, with Ji Ping as a special guest to present the award for the Best Young Athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Beijing Winter Olympics promotional video is playing on a loop at the event venue.
Such a disappointment.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and the establishment of a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border ports (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people arriving at land border ports to undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities can study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides of the border are frequent.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, transforming from one line of defense against the spread of the pandemic to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the control points forward and compress the risk of pandemic spread, achieving the maximum effect of pandemic control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate timely monitoring and warning of the local epidemic situation, failure to implement the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, routine nucleic acid testing being merely formal, inadequate disinfection of cold-chain items in each link, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic situation.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without relaxation and with scientific precision, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that cities at all ports should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, cities (districts, states, leagues) where they are located, and directly-administered cities, with the specific scope to be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Xinhua News uncovers the truth of the US military's bloody slaughter over the past 20 years through YouTube videos.
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube titled "Killing Machines" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American democracy through war. For 20 years, they have been fighting fiercely, bloodthirsty, and killing innocents, committing various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to launch airstrikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and forming killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects".
One after another atrocity committed against humanity has aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war has become "more terrorizing than terrorizing".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this customer wants to use a logistics company in the bonded area to do canning, even though canning is a deep processing and does not belong to the scope of business of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many factories of dairy products and have been exposed to many production lines of dairy products.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are the same, without any difference.
So everyone must be wondering: why is the shelf life of bagged food one year, while the shelf life of canned food is two years or longer?
Or you may ask, why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged products?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, with this mentality, say that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different after eating it!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reasons for the expensive hearing aids. Where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the bagged pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even no profits, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in the pricing of their products to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer packaging in boxes rather than bags.
Moreover, you think so many manufacturers' annual advertising expenses are tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
So with the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as promotional personnel in the mall, display expenses, product gifts expenses, advertising expenses, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, especially audio equipment, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, use any means necessary to connect with doctors in hospitals and have them help with product promotion, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is to defraud consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and store it in a can at home, which can save money while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Don't assume that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to preserve and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food delivery was late and the food was cold, which made it dry and hard, so it was completely inedible.
And the soup was also poured out.
Cancel it immediately, the things #PRS_ORG# sent must have gone cold.

Don't let people be intimidated at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of books on success education.
Many of the success books today promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it has skipped the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it" all at once.
Therefore, these books all have one common characteristic - either give it your all and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100% or 0%; either climb Mount Tai or stay put.
This "best principle" is universally recognized as "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you need to change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, adheres to the rules, and resists change.
Most people are timid in the face of the word "change", reluctant to take the first step, and unable to make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "change" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid performance of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, leaving most people "sighing at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that can lead more ordinary people to the path of relative success.
The core of the "Second Best Principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
All in all, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it has become possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will increase.
The path to success following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, although the "best principle" appears to be a banner for everyone to be successful, it actually only motivates a few in the end; while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency reported from Xining on December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) that according to the latest monitoring results from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the amount at the beginning of the protection in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Kangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the environment in the spawning areas of the naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the resource reserve of Qinghai Lake naked carp is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, as the weather was cold.
Is the takeout packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was lost in transit or if someone took it, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about menstruation and it was too long.
Here's a bit of education for the uninformed males.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly one day between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of physical health, it will come once a month regularly.
But it's not regular enough to make accurate predictions. Generally, there is a tolerance of about one week, so preparation is needed in advance. Sometimes, bad luck can cause a sudden change several days ahead.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of cramps vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; cramps can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
When menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding for 24 hours from start to finish, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton strips to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. If you take ibuprofen before the pain starts at the beginning of the menstrual cycle, it can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking ibuprofen after the pain starts will not be of much help.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release, diarrhea is likely to occur.
If it's around the time of your period, and you have an unexplained stomachache, your period will usually come within two days.
Sanitary napkins should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day. That's 42 pieces a week. If you add the extra ones you prepared, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Health cotton swabs do not need to be changed frequently, about every five or six hours, and at most eight hours.
During the menstrual period, hormones may make you more irritable, and during the ovulation period, hormonal changes may also make your mood unstable, which is really unfortunate, as your body trips itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Fluid is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrium.
After menstruation ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood as the uterus is a house, building a house (endometrium thickening) every month to prepare for guests, but if the guests don't come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, it involves bleeding for a few days and 24 hours a month, as well as abdominal and back pain. Who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother has had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a female body for bearing life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending the wrong gifts is quite disappointing.
Order additional food for the children.
Hoping that the store will check the products even in the midst of a hundred busy tasks.
Is the numbness caused by electric leakage when taking a foot bath?
Choosing the right foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic and health care effect. Today, Gome's small editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health and wellness, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan. This gives consumers a great deal of choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-care home appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up unexpectedly. To his surprise, Mr. Li found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
He found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the long-standing foot bath basin in terms of the highest temperature setting, which population it is suitable for, and what materials guarantee safety.
Generally, there is no electric shock issue with foot baths, but there is no guarantee that all products have been strictly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when shopping, choose a split-type foot bath basin.
Separating water and electricity eliminates any safety risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test it.
The 13th Provincial Tea Exhibition Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
On the morning of December 10th, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician Liu Zhonghua of the Chinese Academy of Engineering solemnly introduced: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum for the "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Xiang tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen their efforts. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving increased income for the majority of tea farmers.
Fortune turns in cycles, and luck is on the rise again.
Tea industry experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Newhua celebrated the "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Xinghua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General Wang of the Provincial Tea Association said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
Newhua Red Tea adds a touch of red, infusing it with the connotations of tea culture, with its popularity and trading booming, the Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, as there is no place to park below, he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the words "The above is called Tao, and the below is called instrument" in the "Book of Changes•Commentary on the Appended Phrases", which was translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue in the Meiji era.
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology and its related issues.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any assumptions about the existence of God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and researches human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior people should abide by, applies ethics (the academic field of applying ethical theories to practical situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theories, but by investigating the actual moral agents' real choices that have been made and observed, and all the moral factors that have led to these choices. It studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic ethical thought, represented by people such as Valery and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvinism.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian aid they have given us over the past 30 years since our relatives passed away, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It was your acts of charity that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the novel coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease humanitarian donations to our suffering group - the Tiananmen Mothers. This humanitarian aid activity should have been concluded long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere greetings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Fraternity Council of the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.
(Apple Daily Picture: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often cannot reach the hands of the vulnerable 64ers smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund" and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Household Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
These projects are mainly funded by donations from campuses and society in 1989, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Democracy Foundation of Brother University.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Research Foundation for Reformation through Labor.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims of the Tiananmen Square Massacre finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th incident.
During this period, China Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donation was for the consideration of the donors, who are mostly retired people with incomes not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to his friends.
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate the project within two years, and resume it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generous and brave enough to risk delivering humanitarian aid for years.

Thank you very much for choosing our product. Before using our chip, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
After opening the box, please check if the goods are complete.
If there is any missing item, please contact customer service promptly.
The cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that will cause chemical reactions with PC.
Do not use a syringe pump to directly inject samples into the chip, otherwise leakage may occur.
Commonly, microfluidic chips are tested with pure water under 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure before shipment.
Chips with glass substrates are tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) inlet pressure before delivery. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using glass substrate chips, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution during use and do not exceed this range, otherwise leakage may occur.
For the conventional substrate-based microfluidic chip, we suggest that the flow rate be set below 150ul/min when using a syringe pump to inject pure water, and the flow rate for the oil phase should be set below 50ul/min.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample liquid comprehensively, and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channels in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.

[Result] Photo effect: Took two sets of clothes, overall it's not bad, I like this set of pictures~
[Service] Service details: Because I felt a bit uncomfortable when doing makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and they kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Suite Price: 1000 Yuan
Thank you for the feedback, Rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep going. We will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, it is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and can match the makeup suitable for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also top-brand ones.
Teacher Tian Liang needs no introduction, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing together.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague took some photos in Beijing, and after looking at the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I specially looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, which is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a well-crafted team.
We and the people around us all praised it without end.
I have already recommended my best friend, and she was equally delighted after seeing the photos.
I hope such studios won't be buried, more people can discover it and take photos with their own style, instead of being all the same.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customers like us, we will do our best to complete it. Grateful to meet each other.
Sweet and caring assistants, and lively and cheerful photography teachers, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting and an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for your comment, Xiao Yu. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust between us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to know you all. I'll come back to Qinhuangdao to play if I have the chance.
How do I finance it?

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose self-learning, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution. It is best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students from the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hi, I'm not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation. Learning this subject is closely related to one's own situation.
For example, profession, age, language to be learned, and even in which city, all these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-learning, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one is expensive to learn, and two, it takes a lot of time to invest, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the case I'm talking about, self-learning is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be used in combination with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can afford to pay certain learning costs and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it also helps in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my views. As I don't know your situation, I can only give a brief introduction. If you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it all on the app.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) wall-mounted stove hot water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, installation of lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, and home services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me thumbs up. Work hard for life, life is tiring but we must continue.
Life won't let down those who work hard. Follow me if you like it. Thank you to those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, while we have to endure the process alone. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back.
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue is worth it at that moment, and there will be a return for the effort!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services can do it for you to "clean" the best I can, and serve your home.
Keep every family clean, set a benchmark for housekeeping services, and provide cleanliness to the home.
Cleaning indoors and outdoors, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and lose their luster. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. The same is true for life.
Success comes from doing things with care, and craftsmanship is achieved through meticulousness. We take our sewing seriously.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is trustworthy. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to make a living in any industry right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance and effort, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day starts with the morning, and all the beauty begins from the dawn. I hope you start the new day with joy, luck, health and all the best. Have a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something that we had when we possessed it; when we grew up, happiness became a goal that we achieved when we reached it; when we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and we were happy when we understood it.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: good physical health and good mental health, live life to the fullest until old age!
Every stage of life comes with its own set of challenges.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since avoidance is not an option, it is better to face it with acceptance.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face the challenge head-on, the problem will eventually be solved.
The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, jointly organized by Chinese curators, was held.
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Fei Yu, Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, serving as Art Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibition items, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly concerned, some of which use recycled materials in a novel way, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain Series" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Daryl Yeo, CEO of the Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this Biennial could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia that is rapidly developing, and to strengthen the interaction between them.
Fei Yu Tian said, "The goal of the biennial is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
It is understood that during the period of the biennial opening, a series of lectures will be held. Artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continuously help the impoverished population with employment and to consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of rural public welfare posts to promote rural revitalization and to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the poor to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly unified the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for rural public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that positions should be set according to the principles of "position setting according to demand, personnel assignment according to position, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one position per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement for on-the-job.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts. The regulations also stipulate that the development departments of each rural public welfare post should purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel of the rural public welfare post.

Hello.
Can I cancel my order?
I'm placing a new order.
Has it been cancelled?
Although the right-wingers had their successful times in history, they were not long-lasting. Therefore, they were short-lived because they flourished with a little sunshine and perspired with a little boiled water; they could reach the horizon of Longxi when they were successful, but they could be defeated and scattered when they were attacked.
But realistically speaking, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of politics and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his words and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and the social issues in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, a mixture of political groups, and foreign powers taking advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunities are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Leftists are actually a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with each other while refuting each other's opinions, and they were quite passionate. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both unreasonable and there is no point in trying to argue.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the opposition and the left-wingers to admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the traitors insult you for five cents, when the left-wingers call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or they become obsessed with pursuing them.
As the ideal gradually fades away, even the dragon-slaying youth eventually becomes an evil dragon.
In my opinion, left and right usually refer to constraint and freedom. Due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese history and culture, China as a whole should be more left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing domestically emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, focusing more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole hopes for more fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is leaning left, which is certain, and is estimated to last for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
No more words, that's just how loyal and righteous Flower is.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to US-affiliated companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to blockade China's chip industry at the same time, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chain globally.
Nowadays, the shortage of chips has affected all major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are severely affected.
In order to gain control over the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have been taking frequent actions recently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish the Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing to support US tech giants. For example, the old US tech giant Intel, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Intel's decision was dismissed by TSMC founder Morris Chang.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the wafer field was because he still remembered the grudges between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world, and is the overlord of the world semiconductor field.
Up until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful entities.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured and tested by one factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of strain on small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to afford the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that if there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became reality and Taiwan Integrated Circuit (TSMC) was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business to the single link of "wafer processing", providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
It is unexpected that the giants who looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services in the past now have to start doing semiconductor contract manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was ironic.
Now the market value of TSMC has surpassed Intel.
Faced with the strong offensive from TSMC, Intel naturally cannot remain stagnant.
Now, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to overtake the competition.
Don't wait.
It's been two hours since I placed the order at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some weird trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Good Friends Price Increase, and Huo La La Incident. Public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then [index declines] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look no different from the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China has previously displayed.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of "solitary peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff".
【Peak-shaped】 refers to artificially heating up quickly to rush into the hot search list and attract public attention; 【Sawtooth-shaped】 refers to periodic heating up to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff-shaped】 refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to take on new tasks and rush to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which manipulate decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuned operations, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Public relations is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black PR will also be helpless.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12th. According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron Rong strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain on the 10th.
According to Minister of Health Kailesh Jugutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the nucleic acid test on November 30th after contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons have turned negative and they have returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they all have mild symptoms, they did not need to be hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health also announced that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister, Kumbuzo Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had identified its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
The health department of the country conducted genome sequencing on 12 positive samples of the novel coronavirus collected from November 9 to December 2, and found 3 cases of infection.

At first, it was introduced by a friend, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of frauds.
I went to the store for the first time and just showed them my house plan. They didn't measure the house on site, but they were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000. They showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you get to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this money can never be refunded unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated. In a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, didn't include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything.
When I went to get my money back, they showed a lot of experience, with a special team to deal with me.
No matter what, we will bite the bullet and take responsibility for the customer's issue, even if they are not at fault.
They shift the blame around and there are many details that I don't want to talk about, all in all, don't choose them because my friend's house that they renovated was of poor quality and they will charge you for various fees later.
Damn it, they are the same scammers who used to be the leader in decoration, now they changed their name to Da Mei, and it seems like they closed down again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a lousy home improvement company.
When choosing in the future, everyone should do more Baidu searches and consult these because home improvement is not a small expense.

The night sky has an appointment | The Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Anjiu, an astronomy enthusiast from Beijing, photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Shi Xiu-li, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical popularization, said that just like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower will appear at the end of the year, with the "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the Geminids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move at a slower speed, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors seen per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
Recommended index chart for the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower, also known as the "Luyinbinfen" meteor shower, left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the excitement will be discounted a bit.
On the 14th of the lunar calendar, the moon phase is full and bright, which will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later half of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast. Then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots. Use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter release cables are also essential for stability and continuity.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the topic should refer to the LCD television, and the difference in market positioning between laser television and LCD television mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD television sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, the sales of laser TVs will grow more than 140% in 2020, continuing its high-speed growth.
The reason for its success in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Sae-Xi Laboratory of China Electronic Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
In the current era of increasing emphasis on visual health, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the television market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small and compact host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat generation, less equipment loss, and longer TV life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, biomimetic screen and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some ambient light, using a microstructured Fieller screen is expensive; the price of an 80-inch screen is basically enough to exchange for a 65-inch LCD.
Furthermore, I particularly despise projection manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. Even if you take LCD TVs seriously, it is also diffuse "direct" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it can't form an image at all.
What was overlooked was the hot spot (light spot) effect of high gain screens, when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that's when it really becomes uncomfortable.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, specializing in quality retail, currently has no branches.
After adding her on WeChat, the lady sent me the available time slots and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's photography works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and there were many styles of photography involved.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the salesperson about my ideas. She was very patient and helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with the makeup and styling~ The photographer will arrange some props before shooting and guide the action. He is also very meticulous about the details.
But maybe because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should still look nice 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style, which feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the piece, just wait and see the result.
I won the photography-themed feast for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting is the younger brother of the 95-year-old. It feels a bit immature. I hope to give more suggestions in terms of customer shooting action guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process is quite pleasant.
The Visual Arts Photography Gallery selects quality stores for photography aesthetics.
Let's check out Queenie too now that we're on the homepage!
First fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store, then choose the clothes, wedding dresses are also available. They were quite patient when I tried on three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I spent a long time on makeup and the service attitude was also good. Later, they will teach you how to pose for the photography. The only downside is that the photos look like my face is too big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received it in three or four days, and it didn't seem to be much different from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside of which is a photography studio.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
Fashion designers are very patient.
Photographers will also take the time to teach you poses.
If unsatisfied, the photographer will proactively suggest a reshoot.
【Experience】The styling may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows was also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily no-eyebrow makeup.
The photos were delivered ten days ago, but the photoshopped effect was not satisfactory. It still looks obvious that the double eyelids were pasted.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried on two sets. After looking back and forth, I still chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After doing my hair and makeup, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites to be edited. The guy said he would finish the job within 15 minutes and the result was very satisfactory.
I haven't received a reply for 3 days... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay for shipping costs every time now.
Can I be exempted first and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, initiators have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million yuan to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, they require strength, approval from the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Little Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Little Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, with both the claimant and the insurer being Hetai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode, the products of Internet platforms have a higher cost-effectiveness than those of traditional offline channels, due to the absence of operating expenses and salaries of business personnel. Moreover, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, which can reduce the burden of policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the insurance agent, this is especially important because insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insured, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance phone sales on "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyusan, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but people are not. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers do not know what they have bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
It's like getting 600 million from an insurance company for just one dollar (like a dream come true).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - free coverage of 60,000 for critical illness is short-term. If there is no other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 won't be enough to solve the problem and life will start to become bare.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the mis-selling of internet insurance.
Therefore, overall, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have more products and more opportunities for customers to choose from. Some products also have better cost-effectiveness than internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers with offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast three companies for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody for customers, so that customers can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance procedures by clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there is no "ceremony" feeling when purchasing internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" assembly line work, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, should we think carefully about the "intermediary" we choose, whether it is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery service?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider left the delivery at the door and then left.
Still sent wrong

No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have already bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and cursing, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we put aside political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me a friend request on Facebook, then posting sarcastic posts, to when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only kept tagging me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to talk about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, some of which were subtle and humiliating, such as comments about my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed. I...just let it go.
Later, I received messages from many friends about your Facebook account, with a photo of you and comments containing sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a female, I can no longer remain silent.
After my report of the crime was uploaded to the news, you didn't show any restraint, instead you became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
Yes, you can continue this kind of teasing, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are just caring and paying attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your chart or continue to make all offensive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you either. My looks and figure don't need your judgment.
I don't even think any female would be willing to be humiliated in exchange for fame.
A friend asked me, "How are you doing?"
I said it, but you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl who has been bullied can still say she is okay.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of people.
I have cut out some of the messages for everyone to evaluate.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the posts you have made yourself.
I can only say that you are a civilized public enemy.

Vietnam People's Network - Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that despite the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10% in 2021.
In 2021, Vietnam has cultivated a large number of digital products, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform, and taking on the task of developing these national digital platforms is taking on the mission of the country.

The surroundings are not great, there are only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the restaurants is average.
This elevator is also very frustrating, just like a big illness. It goes back and forth between the negative second floor and the negative first floor, no matter how many times I press the button for this floor. It's also very frustrating that it goes directly to a furniture store, and the furniture store is closed, so I can't get out of the safety passage!
Home improvement is still necessary, as there are many areas that have yet to be developed.
The address is No. 555, Gaotie North Road, Shayibake District. It is convenient for transportation and the parking lot is large. It is free during the day.

The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service zone is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the marine green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services to ships and sailors, helping them solve the "urgent distress" problem.
This time, two water green comprehensive service areas were built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It integrates life service, production service and government service, taking green environmental protection as the theme, and taking ship repair and ship emergency rescue service as the characteristic, realizing the "one-time berthing and multiple services" of ships in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal, rarely visiting Guam, is sending important signals to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, on January 9th, a satellite detected the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform is expected to deploy the USS Carl Vinson to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-borne transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Lincoln also carried its first F-35C squadron, which is part of the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region also has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The strongest weapon is rarely visited in Guam.

According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness)
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Guam Naval Base last Saturday (January 15).
The US has assembled three aircraft carriers around China, with the rare visit of the most powerful weapon to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon has rarely visited Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture is Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Raging Thunder" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomer" the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad, which also includes launch silos for ballistic missiles on US soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop of Meta and the evaporation of 251 billion US dollars in market value, why did Mark Zuckerberg respond that they are facing unprecedented competition?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform to realize monetization.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google takes another stab, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies in China doing overseas business.
Meta has about hundreds of employees in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, with most of the money spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, yet Meta has made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise at Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decrease in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but more importantly, on expectations for the future.
Clearly, the expectations for Meta are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The origin universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the origin universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current popularity and its annual revenue of 10 to 20 billion US dollars, Facebook is actually feeling a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies, it does not have any good security walls.
Although his several social apps have a relatively high daily active users and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Attempting to reach the unattainable concept of the universe in a short period of time is completely hopeless, which is why Facebook is so dangerous. This is also why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new paths. However, I think his choice of paths was wrong and it was a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.
