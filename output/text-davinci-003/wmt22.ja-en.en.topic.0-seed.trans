When I tried to buy an entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What is the difference?
I couldn't find out by researching, so please tell me.
There should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
Although they look different, they are the same.

With that kind of entertainment available, I don't even feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was too much? Television is all about entertainers anyway.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
It's creepy when a comedian who obviously isn't funny says "You have to laugh at everything I say because I'm popular", like they're trying to force a laugh.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the entertainer's mood, and it won't be pleasant in terms of working together.
It's like the old black companies, that industry is like a sports club, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a bad attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work and say "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but I don't like to be told that being an entertainer is a difficult job and that I have to reach the top of the peak.
It sounds like a justification for one's own career beautification and for comedians taking too high a position in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the entertainment industry is becoming increasingly unreasonable.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from Tsutaya Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
In summary, I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale, but the wired version arrived instead. I was told that if I wanted a refund, I would have to return it.
Rather than talking about custom PCs, it's an online shopping trouble, and I can't accept it no matter how I think about it, so I'll write it here since it's a well-known place.
The trigger was discovering that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen (Linked to Fish Taku) at the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Takutaku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order email normally and the shipping email arrived the next day.
In both of these emails and my page purchase history, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the lack of communication or cancellation notifications from the order to the shipment, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
Here's the problem: a few hours after shipping, we got an email saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email
They were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse for a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your response.
It seems that the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, and although the purchase history, email, and delivery note were all written as wireless versions, it was sent as wired version without permission.
Isn't it unfair that they sent a different product than what was purchased without any understanding and then demand that it be returned for a refund?
In the end, I want to make a counterattack of some kind to accept the refund, so please lend me your wisdom.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside was washed away by the typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara District in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a big impact on the lives of the 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"It was such a sudden collapse, I wonder if it was washed away," I felt. The only road connecting the Takachi Plain district, the Takachi Plain Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not open to the public, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Matsumoto: "Normally I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry it or carry it and cross the iron bridge on foot, so I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge was completed a month later, and within three months it was washed away by heavy rain and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was installed.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I think we should try to secure enough supplies for two to three days," We have stocked up about three times more food that can be used for emergency rations, such as canned food and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "Since you never know when a disaster might strike, I felt again that it's better for everyone to have some supplies prepared. On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with the bridge being washed away."
To not forget the lesson, the town started its own initiatives from 2021.
Mr. Ryuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Department of Yatsumi Town: "We have announced that we would like to designate October 12th as "Yatsumi Town Disaster Prevention Day" and use it as a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo hosted an event where participants could run a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital technology.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and people who visited the venue wore special equipment to run on a simulated Paralympic marathon course in the virtual space.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing participants from both inside and outside the country to experience a marathon-like competition while running together, and they can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough while running but it's really fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure people can enjoy it in sports gyms and other places too," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
The pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The new "Building Condition Survey" system has been established to revitalize the used housing market, and used housing transactions are doing well.
Both the prices of detached houses and condominiums are increasing, and the renovation market is also expanding.
With the coronavirus pandemic increasing the preference for owning a home, there is a concentration of popularity on properties represented by words such as "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale", and "tower", which have been rising in price. This has also likely been affected by the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing circulation in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a building condition survey, called an inspection, for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate Business Act (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
It can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for conducting building condition surveys is usually the seller.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system was made obligatory.
In other words, real estate agents in charge of intermediation have the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking abroad, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In these systems, the seller leads the inspection, and the risks are taken into consideration.
Before a real estate purchase, buyers can request a building inspection from experts known as inspectors or building surveyors.
For example, in the United States, depending on the state, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of the transactions for existing homes.
In that the buyer is in the lead to conduct the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly for the seller, is significantly different in nature.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, and to sell it as high and as quickly as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey contents and thinking of carrying out appropriate repairs so that they can live in peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the objectives and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection mandated by the government is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed inspection, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, intermediaries (sellers) who introduce the assigned project can also be considered customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections may be conducted with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

Was Ginza an island?
Five trivia topics you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula back in the day.
As evidence of that ... ..., it's only in Ginza that you can show off your trivia knowledge.
Let's introduce you to some interesting facts about Ginza that you'll want to share with someone after you learn them.
Let's go up Ginza!
First dive into the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can find many traces of its history, such as unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As we were walking around Ginza, the sudden silence was broken by her saying, "You know, this used to be a peninsula back in the day."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The synonym of the bustling shopping district that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint where silver coins were made. In 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawachō," but when it moved to Ginza it became known by its nickname, "Ginza."
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
From before the Edo period, the Inari-gawa River flowed into the Marunouchi area from Hibiya, and a peninsula called "Edo-mae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
Then, the soil that was dug out of the moat and the Kanda mountain were cut down and used to fill in the inlet.
If you are interested, why not try looking for the monument of "Ginza's Origin Place" which indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Ginza Tiffany Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku)?
A "pilgrimage" to Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "pilgrimage" known to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibei Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, the "Ryuko Fudo-son" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and the "Ginza Desse Jizo-son" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi Ginza Terrace.
The "Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back alleys and are not very noticeable. The "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located on the 1F entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In places where there are many farmers, the "Inari Shrine" where a fox greets you in front of the shrine was built enthusiastically, believing that it would bring the benefit of "abundant harvest of five grains" where the rice grows well.
This eventually led to the belief that having a thriving business would bring good fortune, and even in the bustling Ginza district, the most prosperous area in Japan, faith began to spread.

Two days ago, I experienced a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, so I went to the dentist.

Since it's the coronavirus, it was fun to stay at home and drink a lot of alcohol without meeting anyone.
I made a retro game Super Play video at the end of the year and uploaded it on New Year's Day, and it was played five times (which is considered good progress in the industry).
While jogging on the first day of the new year, I was fiddling with the settings of a smartphone app in the park in the middle of the night when a security guard approached me (first conversation of the new year).

South Korea's Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
On the 12th, Posco International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, pending the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the local corporation.
This acquisition will be the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy 49.9%.
Posco International explained that even in the energy transition era, the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing, and in the hydrogen market, blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the market with green hydrogen, and this is why they decided to make the acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operation personnel in Australia.

Could the pain in your knee be osteoarthritis?
Treatment methods vary depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor's Note: I have been having persistent knee pain recently.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common one for Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial team: Does that mean the joint has become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can become worn down or distorted.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial team: Does osteoarthritis occur in joints other than the knee?
Yes, Mr. Maruyama.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the base, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the foot, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is in the knee, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial: So, what is the structure of a joint?
Professor Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
Furthermore, the part where these two bones face each other is covered by the articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by the joint capsule.
The editing department: It has a complex structure, doesn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making knee movement smoother, which is why.
Editorial: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Professor Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, playing a role.
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause deformity of the joint and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
Although I usually wear pajamas, when my pajamas are in the wash I wear a tracksuit or something to sleep in!
Are there people who can quit smoking even if they are heavy smokers, and people who cannot quit?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he felt like he should try stopping, so he ended up stopping without making a definite decision.

"Kaiji Series Gambling & Game 3 Selections (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News" - Experience it for real.
The KAJI series of gambling manga, boasting explosive popularity among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where life is at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tingle... ... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
Therefore, this time I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a planning video.
The pachinko "swamp" featured in the gambling abstinence record Kaiji is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaiji was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This swamp was filled with large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono" and "3-Step Curl", making it almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end, he resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The "Iron Crossing" of the "Human Horse Race" was conducted on the debtors, including Kaiji, as an entertainment at the "Star Side Party" hosted by the wealthy.
The debtor must proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people participate, and the top two can win a prize, but there are only four steel beams, and safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, it can be experienced very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge is a single iron bridge that rises to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and beyond it are the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge", which can be reached on foot.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Corera Kōarashi released a video on his own YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming it was an experience that could be had in Japan, and it became a topic of conversation.
"E Card" is a two-player card game.
Play with 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, divided into Emperor and Slave sides.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the story, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
After a long and difficult battle, Kaiji eventually realized that his opponent was reading his mind through a device attached to his ear, like an earphone, which sensed and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature. In order to confuse Rinkai-gawa and win the battle, Kaiji shaved his ears to the extreme and altered his body to abnormal values.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, uploaded a video of him playing against actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji, with an E-card, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the New Year, the Yamagata Shimbun gently encourages people to visit the prefectural guardian shrine and offer a large votive horse of the year of the Tiger.
At the prefectural shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive horse of the zodiac sign of the coming year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared.
On the 11th, a group of Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine, and a ceremony of offering to the gods was held.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from the National University of Arts to create the original drawings for the ema since two years ago.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese painting course instructed by Professor Suehara Toshimitsu, the work of 22-year-old Tsuchiya Yui was selected.
The O-ema is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya-san said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping in place, the sight of the tiger looking at the cherry blossom flowers was filled with the wish that "even in a world of drastic change, one can still have the luxury of appreciating the beauty of nature".
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the ema generally distributed.
Gonnegi Kenichi (44) said, "I think I can be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano that wants to continue living" - A workshop for four high school students in the city to propose ideas: San-Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy recommendation project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the voices of young people are collected and proposed to the mayor.
What makes you happy?
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer out loud, such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
18 high school students and local people discussed "an interesting town", "a livable town", and "a town where you can feel a sense of purpose" while moving around an "island" with each person assigned a theme, using the "World Cafe" method.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting that there are many young people in the town." "Transportation such as trains and buses are indispensable for living convenience."
Are there any common points? Let's discuss further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the coast is attractive," said Tamano Commercial High School third-year student (18).
Binnan High School third-year students (18) noticed not only the local issues but also the charm of the area by talking with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to be surrounded by nature."
The second meeting in December will be attended only by high school students to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the education director in February next year and make an announcement.
The president of the center, Higashi-e, said, "We hope to foster a sense of local pride among high school students and provide them with an opportunity to actively participate in community development."

How to Find New Ways to Wear a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Don't you sometimes feel that the scarf gets in the way when you wear it around your neck in winter?
After styling, it is good to check the balance by looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the trick.
I was hoping to find a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and that I could wrap around quickly, and then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wound up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, the fabric is tailored into one piece by weaving it like a narrow and long cut cloth, and the whole is in a net-like pattern.
The mesh of the net is designed so that the edges of the sturgeon can pass through.
Therefore, you can wind it and secure it without connecting the ends.
It is very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be convenient to have a scarf like this.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super entertaining.
Get Buck is a movie directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like the Beatles in their rawest form, and it's all so fresh...
Even though it's right before the breakup, it's not the dramatic tension I was imagining.
While trying his best to keep things in order, he had to deal with Paul, who was annoying with his "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" attitude, George, who was grumbling with a "But still~" attitude, John, who was always late and didn't seem to have much motivation, and Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a "Oh, this is troublesome" face.
We weren't so much in love that we would fight, but there was a very familiar atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had the same feeling. It's like a legendary breakdown or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase and gradually building it up to a famous song while asking each other "How about this?" is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
The scene where a subtle hum gradually turns into a cheerful "Zucha♪ Zucha♪" and lyrics come in is recorded perfectly, it's amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, as it doesn't happen very often.
Of course, everyone is sweating profusely, so just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
So far I've only seen one episode out of three, but it seems like the biggest cause of the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves, right?
Although the four of them would start making music while complaining about this and that, when it comes to the topic of where to hold their live performance, people like producers and promoters would start talking in a Beatles-like manner, saying something like "You guys are the world's number one!", and it was easy to see that the four of them had no control over the situation.
Well, since a documentary also involves the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that might be because Paul is supervising, so there are a lot of scenes where Paul is kind of the villain.

Do not call out the technique name before executing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you have been feeling a sense of responsibility and it has been taking away your peace of mind.
I think it's hard to live a little bit now, isn't it?
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I found that I'm really suited for sales activities that customers need, so I switched to a different industry and it's been much easier to work.
Even though I was reminded of what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do in myself, my life will become a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and relax before considering this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there is a union of the company or an industrial doctor or a consultation window, it may be better to consult there because there may be some system.
It would be great if we could live a little more comfortably in the future.

In the United States, there have been many tornadoes causing significant damage, due to the unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold air influences (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred frequently in the southern United States.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this season caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature is expected to reach close to 30°C on Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air below -30℃ near 5500m in the sky, a vigorous frontal system was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States is an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, which was a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes, gusts of wind, and other severe weather events on Friday alone.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that an EF3 tornado, which is the third strongest on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached with winds of around 70 m/s in a moment.
According to future surveys, there is a possibility that it will be classified as an EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, to suit the conditions of Japanese buildings.
This JEF3 tornado, which is equivalent to the one in the US, has a high possibility of occurring in Japan as well, and it is at a level where wooden houses collapse.

According to the Nikkan Sports, voices calling for help were broadcast live from under the "historic largest" debris of the U.S. tornado (Yahoo! News).
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
It was reported by U.S. CNN television and other media.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the death toll will exceed 100.
【Photo】Residents carrying furniture and other household items from damaged houses in Kentucky, which was affected by a tornado. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
The record of the damage range of the tornado is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) which caused damage to Missouri in 1925, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the maximum scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered great damage, the candle factory, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas season, also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remained.
Trapped under a pile of rubble about 1.5 meters thick in the darkness, the woman felt the weight of the rescuers searching above her and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the live broadcast that was released, the sound of "Happy Birthday To You" sung by another woman, seemingly in an attempt to mask her fear, was also heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store employee living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people likened it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumbling from the earth," he recalled.
The police officers of the Meadfield City Police will continue their search operations until they are no longer necessary.
He continued his desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, part of an Amazon warehouse collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of the cars being separated, and the highway has been blocked off due to the effects of vehicle overturns.
According to US media, approximately 400,000 households in Tennessee, including 130,000, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to increase it?

Avoid rough-cut raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

It's tough to be on social welfare...
Praying that something can be done
It would be nice if there were "live-in work" options like inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.
I did a quick search and it looks like there are sites like this ↓,
Live-in Part-time/Full-time Job - Live-in Job Navi (Suminavi)
There are "bargain, live-in, job" related searches, so it seems like there are a lot of people like that among my colleagues.

What does it mean to be a specialist in gynecology?
A specialist doctor is a physician in the 3-5 years after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Advanced Trainee Doctor".
The so-called "resident" refers to a "first-year resident," which is a doctor in their first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, when I reach 4-5 years of experience, I will be able to do certain medical treatments, so I will be entrusted with various tasks.

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries base their points on a five-star system, Japan's claim is that three stars should be considered neutral and points should be added or subtracted from there.
At the baseline, there is already a two-star difference, and four stars mean completely different meanings, "there are elements that need to be deducted" and "it is not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we use a 5-star rating system as the standard, then both "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest level in all aspects" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a defect in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used and such operations are being carried out, I understand why you would not want to give 3 stars (bad review).
Therefore, when trying to refute those who advocate this kind of rhetoric with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity that can be taken from USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
Submersible pumps vary in power consumption, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.
The numbers differ greatly.

DIY Radio Coil
I made an AM radio with my own capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio sound, but I heard a different radio than the one I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too sweet and not heard clearly, but it was different from what was expected.
Here's the main point, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
Why do you think so? Is such a thing possible?
Is it okay to delete the Esp of SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a loose file in the appropriate location, then it doesn't need ESP.
I remember seeing something about that somewhere, but I can't remember where.
I understand the risks, so I don't plan on actually doing it, but I'm so anxious that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is possible to do it technologically.
If there is someone who remembers, I would like to be told if it is okay to do.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" Fried Fish and Shrimp from the Near Sea and Homemade Tartar Sauce | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box with freshly-caught seasonal fish and shrimp fries, homemade tartar sauce.
"Hakobune," a takeout specialty store with colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes that use plenty of vegetables.
Last August, Kousuke Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple opened [their restaurant] with the aim of providing customers with a restaurant-like experience even at home.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Fried fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
At the market, choose the best fish available at the time.
As Mr. Kiyoshi said, "Fry it so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients, making the batter as thin as possible," the texture of the shrimp fry is directly understood as crispy.
Bento boxes come with four kinds of side dishes, portioned Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the nearby fields' homegrown produce or from local direct sales outlets.
The side dish may vary depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyo has studied French cuisine, adding color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, the Japanese-Western fusion cuisine offers a familiar and comforting taste, such as rolled omelette, that can be enjoyed by people of all ages (Yumi-san).
The bento box "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
The ride is not too bad, but it does occasionally shake (not enough to make you feel sick).
Of course, it is slow in terms of speed.
I think it's safe because I slowed down and even stopped completely when there were people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It's painful to feel the gaze of those around me; even though it's good to be seen, it feels like I'm being a nuisance and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be more convenient if there were fewer people or if they could move to the side.
Specifically, I think it would be good to create dedicated lanes so that they don't interfere with people walking.
I thought it would be better if there were fewer people because you can relax and take in the scenery while riding it.
It was a vehicle that gave a feeling of anticipation for the near future, such as whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and it was difficult to ride unless you had a strong heart that could endure the pain of the gaze of those around you.
It was so embarrassing.

Although it may look like it, there is not a single eel used in this bowl.
The answer is "Nasu"! (Tap to reveal the correct answer)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone just eats it with sauce and that the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly...but I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually quite important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.

On the 12th, a man was slashed and a man escaped on a motorcycle in the Ozai area of Saga City, resulting in an attempted murder incident.
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him as a attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, 110 was called by a passerby who reported that there was a fight.
The man sustained an injury to his left cheek, approximately 10 centimeters in length and 1 centimeter in depth, but he is conscious.
The man who escaped was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man walking and the man on the bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities at the Borders of China (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Find Asia Corporate Consultant in Hong Kong) China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities by the local government, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan Province's Xishuangbanna (also known as Sipsongpanna) is also one of these regions located in Southwest China.
My sister Li Wenda is currently active as an actress. Si Sa Phan Na is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is inhabited by many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group, which shares its roots with the Thai Kingdom.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various countries in Southeast Asia, is flowing.
The autonomous state of Xishuangbanna (Dai) in Yunnan Province, China, covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Li Min-guo at the Sea Sanctuary and hear about his conservation activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Ms. Li, our environmental protection activism "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The catalyst for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he has come to Caspian Sea for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China, boasting a wealth of biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest was carried out.
He was dispatched from Germany to here for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here, I, who had been a journalist, got to know someone and got married.
Before that, did Li not have any interest in environmental conservation?
Mr. Lee, I am from Seychelles, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I had to proceed with the project with my husband.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or an especially tall stature, I sometimes see people who have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out the moment you have self-confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of self-confidence within them.

It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's very detailed.
I haven't been told to praise in detail, so I'm not sure what it means.
What about praising in detail?
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"My heart is blooming with joy after Sakura-san's confession. I accept your offer," I replied, and we began our relationship.
And, in order to be in a relationship, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.

【Omakan / Personal Notes】It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
By March, there were multiple CTDs due to multiple factors, and since I couldn't play much around the GW period, it took a long time to identify them, mainly on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
The main timing of CTD (Computer-Based Training and Development)
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins.
When accumulating kills/attacks on some NPCs: Activation with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement. * Is there a possibility of wet clothes for this?
For some NPCs, camera work when activating kill moves → PC-based kill move settings OFF via .ini to improve the basics: Competition between DAR + Nemesis settings? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoor) Field movement + partial magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting NPC: Use Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application setting (top right of MCM) all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could it be caused by additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although there are formatting mistakes in the 2.0 SPID default.ini, it should result in the intended outcome and the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
At first, I focused on checking motion/combat mods (.dlls) related to body part attacks and OnHit, and this was the result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French level.
If there happened to be someone in a Japanese environment with the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it.
Most of us are barely managing our mental health.
Nobody around notices it, not even colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person looks like they're having a hard time, but they're still working hard."
He is probably on the brink of mental health as well.
Although I haven't officially retired due to mental health reasons, I think I was at my limit right before I retired.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits - After today's visit is over
I have been suffering from bipolar disorder for a long time, so I have been receiving home visits from a nurse (female) at the home visit nursing station I am currently using. I think I have built a very good relationship with her.
We have conversations about different topics every week.
Of course, they also do the necessary things for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply impressed by how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication through today's home visit nursing.
Today we had a discussion, or rather a debate, about gender differences and gender equality.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, or why she got divorced, and so on - is that okay to do in home visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations operated by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that when an occupational therapist comes for visiting nursing, they are given orders from above with an attitude of "This is a medical facility, after all".
The small visiting nursing station I use is managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses are really good because they face me on an equal footing and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There are those who are receiving mental health home visits from nurses, and those who are considering receiving them.
Visiting nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, please take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there were times when I couldn't agree and I had to cancel the contract from my side.
I apologize for my poor writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was startled when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.
Malfunction in language detection

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patents, One-Fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced its Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
By 2022, it was planned to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulative) and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The target for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 places), and the price per kilo of hydrogen is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target.
On the 12th, the National Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
Carbon fibers, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane electrodes by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has been increasing by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations reported that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, meaning that the other countries are at a disadvantage in terms of competition."
The ranking of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one economy in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of China (4721).
The Japan Business Federation proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax deduction for investment and research and development costs.
It has been a month and a half since the surgery to cut the muscle of the finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is slightly swollen and it hurts when I move my hand in the affected area.

I think it's going to be tough if you don't have an address other than for cash on delivery.
And I feel like it would be difficult to do a day payment without a contact (phone number).
Additionally, an address is required for the line contract.
So make sure you don't forget to get a mobile phone line contract...
For the time being, even if it is somehow managed with leisurely reading and daily payments
Address security should be the top priority, so don't forget.
It is important to get a good night's sleep on a futon, and simply having a bank account or debit card, or receiving government services, requires an address.
Social welfare should be available even without a fixed address, but it's probably a rare case.

Is it a crime to sell items at a higher price than the regular price in a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at the store for 70,000.
It is lawful.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the original price.

A parliament on Sunday?
As the reform of the Diet is progressing in Takasu, the "communication book" of the Diet members is also being created in the form of a TV program-like flyer: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Takaesu Town Council is undertaking unique council reforms, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council election is a consecutive three-term no-vote, aiming to get the townspeople to take an interest.
To inform people of the Sunday Council to be held on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"From Morning Giroon," "Tetsuko's Room," "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had catchy wording that reminded people of popular TV shows.
Hyoe Katayama (43), the lawmaker created, said "I want you to come to the Diet with a smile on your face."

The US has arrived in Ukraine with weapons and ammunition to provide assistance, and will also be involved in training troops (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that, by December 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid is equivalent to a total of 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, etc., will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the increase in forces carried out by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is increasing its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate a response in the event that Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the provision of weapons assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st this year.
US military support to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 25 billion dollars.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine, state troops from the US state of Florida were dispatched.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also indicated that it will impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand", directly hitting former Tax Commission Chairman Akira Amari of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking with your family during the end of the year and New Year holidays!"
It is called "Advance Gift and Rush Inheritance".
While the discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year that was a concern, but there is a high possibility that the pre-death gift, which is the orthodox measure for inheritance tax countermeasures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, together with a direct hit to the House of Representatives Member Kanemi, will impart everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance for a timely and advantageous rush gift by the end of the year, to tax-saving techniques.
(Edited by the Diamond Editorial Department, Keiaki Miyahara)
From the wealthy to the urban employees, "forbidden hands" are used for pre-death gifts. "From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer."
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because what is being said is that by changing the rules of inheritance and prohibiting the "gift before death" which is the orthodox way of dealing with inheritance tax, it is intended to increase inheritance tax significantly.
The iron rule for tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is to reduce the taxable property.
The strongest trump card of lifetime gifts has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although the fastest introduction was not included in the outline of the tax system reform announced on December 10th for the fiscal year of 2022, the policy towards integration was once again declared with more detailed wording such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
In response to the main editorial department's interview, former Tax System Research Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and former Secretary General, Aoki Akira, said.
It is most important to ensure that the advantages and disadvantages of asset transfer are eliminated regardless of the timing, and that the tax burden remains the same.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from integration. If we make the fastest amendment, there will be three chances left for lifetime gifts.
Even without that, it seems certain that in the near future, a large step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how do the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa says, "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】Kaname Yamaya as the heroine. Based on the manga of the same name by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the burden of the past.
Koki Furukawa plays the protagonist, Kairi, and Kanon Yamaya plays the heroine, Rise.
Riso, a college student, meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kei, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but could Kairi be a murderer due to some kind of trigger?
Furukawa Yudai commented, "The drama 'My Righteous Older Brother' will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!"
For those who were unable to watch it on FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already watched it, I think you can get to know the work more deeply by seeing the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Risae, their conflicts, and how they change.
I am happy if the original fans can also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

After winning a game with only three passes in the NFL, what were the players feeling and how did they experience it? (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News)
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2000 yards in the previous season for the first time in history.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the runs of Simpson and another RB, Jim Brownston.
The biggest reason why the Patriots deployed such extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s, and it was snowing before the game.
The Bucks, being from the local area, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
There were 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen's shot was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not a poor performance.
The offense had four red zone entries in ten series and had scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced three times in a row to the red zone.
However, they only managed to score 3 points with one field goal in those three attempts.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the match.
The Bills, trailing by 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
It is 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd&14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
Then, he threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, Ace WR Stephen Diggs was running a shallow cross and was open in the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in failure.
Brian was man-to-man covering Bill's WR Call Beasley, but midway he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen threw two passes targeting the end zone, both of which he missed the two receivers.
The fourth down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown on the third down.
You need to get two first downs in the play.
With two minutes left, Allen's ability to run the ball should have been utilized by going for a 4th and short.

According to Harper's BAZAAR, here are three items that you should replace or discard from your kitchen after a long period of time.
Sponge
Even if you replace it frequently, it is probably not as often as recommended for a sponge.
Research in 2017 has shown that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (although it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend changing the sponge once a week to maintain cleanliness.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when a cutting board starts to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria multiply.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Clean the surface with clean water and either let it air dry or lightly pat it dry with a clean paper towel.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cuts on the lips or spills of drinks.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Community markets and trade are two different things.
At the community market, we use Steam's payment system.

Trading is a function that allows items to be exchanged or given as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Are occupation and employment type a different conversation?

Help, FlashBIOS won't finish.
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed without blinking.
I tried to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS, thinking that it might be corrupted, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to take about 5 minutes to finish, but it won't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be an outdated USB memory or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you overslept and become tired?
Are there any other possible causes that are similar?

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to have brand-name items.
I can carry something that is not eye-catching, but I cannot carry something like Louis Vuitton with its iconic monogram and the letters "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your length.
By the way, I think Japan is great.
In Japan, it is .
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why are you talking to me so rudely/in a condescending way?"
If they start to say that it doesn't matter because they are foreigners, it's best to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I even dream of having an unpleasant feeling with a moderate probability.
I had been living abroad for a while, and the Japanese people who went out there, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette. There were quite a few people there, and I think the tension was relieved. I had misunderstandings with the locals, thinking that I could say anything.
If it looks like something a Westerner would do, I don't think there's any malicious intent behind it; it's more like a kind of affection or a friendly gesture.
Even with my friends who are from Europe and America, I usually call them by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, there are moments when I'm a bit unsure which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's a friend.
It's probably just normal behavior, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say something now.
Can you talk to me according to Japanese rules because this is Japan?
Incidentally, my white friend who naturalized always raises his glass higher than the others when we toast at drinking parties.
Without a doubt, I'm conscious of it, but if I do it that way, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
Regardless of personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details in Japanese culture.

Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
I opened Reddit today and saw that this new sub I created had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy!
Thank you all for subscribing!
Actually, as of yesterday, there were only 25 subscribers, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
For those of you who subscribed to this sub today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let us know in the comments section where you heard about this sub! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Currently, there is only one person creating threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.
Even if you don't start a thread, it would be encouraging if you could leave comments, etc.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
If you use Twitter, please start a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The sub-league I created before didn't gather people as I had hoped and I gave up quickly, but this time, thanks to everyone, I feel like I can continue without giving up.
We will do our best to maintain the wiki and rules, and make the sub-reddit easy to use, so please look forward to it in the future!

I only have a limited ability to understand English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of the wording, but I can understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I'm just saying this based on how I feel, so it might be a good idea to ask other people as well).
When it comes to games produced overseas, translations of this level are often seen, and if it's a small company, it feels like they are well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it may take a long time of study to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

An analysis of "Kimetsu no Yaiba" reveals that training is the battle.
"Equal Exchange of Effort" is a human praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemoration Start> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the abundance of training.
Generally speaking, battle-free training arcs, where the characters train day and night, are not popular among readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE" only touched upon the two years of training that the Straw Hat Pirates underwent when they separated, and the rest was glossed over in a grandiose manner.
Well, one of the attractions of traveling is the eccentricity of the places you visit, but sometimes it's not compatible with "staying in the same place and training".
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began with him kneeling to Togako Yagyu, who had saved his life, and begging for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, to which Yagyu said, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are only forced down by the powerful...
While saying that, it was Giin's kindness to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps (even though he is a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rin Takahashi was when Rin asked Tanjiro, "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" Tanjiro was at a loss for words, so Rin gave him a quick retort of "You're slow to judge."
Among fans, it's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that has become a popular topic of conversation.
However, walking with a sister who has become a demon carries the potential that a moment may come when such a decision is forced upon them.
It can be said that initiation into practice begins with a spiritual attitude.
Rin Tazakura, an inexperienced novice, was told to take him to the narrow fog mountain and to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls, pitfalls, and traps, and it is so thin that it seems to die before entering the training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he can detect the faint scent of a trap set by a person, and somehow manage to avoid it, which is barely enough to be called the "protagonist correction".
Even so, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba that makes Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so powerful that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is only being able to use the "power and skills that have been honed up to that point" with their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", which rewards those who put in effort and does not reward those who do not, is a human hymn that does not have a supernatural power like a demon, and is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping on the floor directly with a mattress, futon, and quilt, instead of a bed.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room more widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Shall we have a conversation?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle between different stores?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "stubbornness".
I think of it as "strategy" to try to get more benefit than effort with the least effort.
Are there any smoking cessation clinics available nationwide?

South Korean Samsung Electronics has established a new "DX Division" integrating home appliances and mobile, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into the Set Division, the company announced on the 12th that the name of the division will be changed to DX (Device eXperience) and this will be reflected in the year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the intention is to enhance user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division is composed of business units such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network from the integrated CE and IM divisions.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects the company's mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, it emphasized the intention to make it possible for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, not only for products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities.
With the establishment of an integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to create synergies on a company-wide scale, transcending organizational boundaries, and to build a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Is 1500BCE the same as before the Common Era?
What would it be like to say it in Japanese?
It was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of BCE in recent years, based on the idea that it should be written this way.
BCE stands for Before Common Era (BCE).

Is this Empire of the Undergrowth?
I remember it because I supported it on Kickstarter and I was even in the process of localizing it into Japanese.
Although there are matters of preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I'd like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait, their sharp jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible above the sand... anything that happens to stumble into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The larvae of the damselfly always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch their prey, exposing only their circular head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand, so they can catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about is
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Seeing it from an ant's perspective?
I wonder.
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular head" would make the part about "a giant beast wearing a helmet in the scale of an ant" disappear, wouldn't it...?
24 vehicles collided in Aichi, and the truck driver had no pre-existing condition; was it due to carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident involving 24 cars in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, had no chronic illness and that the accident was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing an initial collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of the Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, it was found that Nomura suspect had no illness and that some kind of carelessness was likely the cause.
The police are searching the premises of the related parties and investigating the situation in detail at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous installment which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this movie focuses on only one battle, packed with new gimmicks!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●The Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a word, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first of all, it should be noted that it is not a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, the competition between us, such as the tug-of-war and the special training scenes, is quite different from before and we can't go to the match, but it's not boring at all.
As the tension of the start of the century's war gradually increases in the work, it certainly leads to the excitement of the readers, and I can't help but marvel at the calculated production of this period.
And before the important finals, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxuriousness of the card as a match, what I like is that before the match, Ramenman is facing the poster of Kinnikuman and saying "Now it's my turn to aim!!"
He tried to hit her with a chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, caught the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with them silently glaring at each other before they parted ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a passionate debate about Kinnikuman.
Seeing this makes me unable to help but think of the far future and the great things I can do!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now, that this is what it means!
Although the fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, the highlight of the scene was the appeal of the Ramen Man's tears after the match.
Don't underestimate the power of fate only for Kinnikuman!
It's a line of dialogue.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers have been feeling a kind of subtle understanding that Kinnikuman will ultimately win because he is the protagonist, even if he doesn't have the power to do so.
But by making Ramenman say this, Yudetamago-sensei had already taken away the option of using that hand, as if to drive a stake into it.
With this one phrase, readers are thinking, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman will defeat Robin with his own strength?"
How?
It will stimulate our imagination with an unpredictable development, and from the perspective of a writer, this is like a self-imposed restriction on the teacher who creates the work.
Wow, you did an amazing thing!
I definitely think this volume's big point is one of them.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Takahama Town Aoba Mountain (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At the Aoba Mountain Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture were surprised to find such a place when they came to Fukui after a long time.
She said it was very beautiful and it made her feel relieved.
Illumination was first planned to avoid crowds and to make people feel healed, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event with button pot serving and movie screenings.
I think that there are only a few people who can read documents in order.
My friend who can read really well told me that he was able to do it, but he was slowly solidifying the basics of Linux and rather than reading documents, he was reading from the table of contents of reference books and reading the parts that interested him.
It is easier to understand and apply if you learn from Linux rather than starting with something abstract like Docker.
It's quite difficult to suddenly understand everything by skipping over it.
It would be nice if I knew, but...
You don't have to do it in order.
Instead of memorizing the content, just vaguely remember the parts you skimmed through before and read them when necessary.
I had no prior reading experience, so I kept breaking things and then reading up on them, and gradually I started to read more.

This morning, an unfortunate event occurred...
The power of the PC for NAS has stopped working.
What happened
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
The PC was powered on at this time.
2.) After a while, I noticed a pink rotor-like sound coming from the PC, so I shut it down first.
At this point, I thought that the fan movement was only getting worse due to the room temperature drop (6℃).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) It won't start.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp will light up for a moment and the fan will start to move but will soon stop.
After that, he said nothing.
Even after unplugging the power cord and trying again, it still only turns on for a moment.
4.) I tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, and removing all other parts, but it still won't boot.
5.) I have heard a buzzing sound coming from the PSU fan before, so I am suspicious that it might be the cause of the issue.
I'll try to find an ATX power supply that's left over and give it a try later.
Maybe.
I wonder what I should do if it doesn't work out.
Should I change the case and the motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?

The crying-laughing emojis at 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are really easy to use, aren't they?
Of course when it's funny and happy, I did it!
Wouldn't it be true that even in times when one feels like nothing can be done, there are still few people who use self-deprecation?
On the contrary, those who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are rare of the rare.
I want you to stay true to that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripherals?
Computer farm
I have brought it in once, but it is located in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, but Saitama Prefecture does not collect it for free.
Relatively newer technologies are available for free.
Inverse Net
I haven't used it before, but it seems that Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear the reviews.
Coarse waste (paid) and additional information> Collection boxes of the local government (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it secondhand.
Update: Mercari and Hard Off
Have you ever sold anything on flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It might be a wise choice to sell while it is still worth money.

Everywhere refuses to take away the broken printer, old UPS, etc. which have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's being put off for now.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much value this coin has?
Coins circulating in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, paper money can be exchanged, but coins cannot be exchanged.
With commemorative coins, there is value because they contain gold.
Even if they haven't done anything wrong, there are times when you can dislike them, right?
Yes, it is natural for humans to have likes and dislikes.
People who don't like something (for no reason) are like that.

She can't do it, is she being discriminated against because of her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that things can be judged by appearance.
It can't be seen on the surface because it's an emotion.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, we were roommates, haha.
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
All desires and youthfulness will be lost with age.
If you are healthy.
The men's volleyball team has advanced to the championship tournament for the first time in 29 years! / The men's fencing team's Freel placed 4th and did not win a medal.
The Japanese men's volleyball team, Ryūjin Nippon, has advanced to the final 8 for the first time in 29 years! Coach Nakagaki: "It was a big goal."
When I lost the third set with a double referee challenge, I thought it was all over, but I won the full set.
The men's foil team in fencing failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
I think our opponent in the semi-finals was in a different league, so why is that opponent in the third-place decider?
I would like to plant a tree that will provide a screen in the garden. Could you please recommend a tree for this purpose?
As a hope, it would be nice to have a low-maintenance evergreen tree that produces fruit.
Nice to meet you.
To get fruit from a fig tree, it is best to plant other fruit-bearing trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby, as this will help the fig tree to bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to have between us in order to live together without any financial difficulty?
Everyone is different.
Where you live and how the relationship works out depends on the situation.
It would be better to end the cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is best to have a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal services, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation has no benefits.
I think it would be best to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-recorded legendary rare (^_^;)
Is there any kind of card game like Gambling that can be used as a hobby?
I think it's an ant.
