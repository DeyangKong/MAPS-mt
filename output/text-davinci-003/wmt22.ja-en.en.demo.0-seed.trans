Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation by Durandal against Thalia?

With that kind of thing available, I don't really feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the comedians couldn't do it? Television only has comedians.
Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing and giggling in the background even when nothing particularly funny was being said.
Clearly, when something isn't funny but people laugh because "it's a popular comedian so you have to laugh at everything they say," it's creepy and inexcusable.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it would be awkward in terms of work relationship if the comedian's mood gets ruined.
It's like the old black companies, and the industry is like a sports club, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a normal unpleasant attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work by constantly talking about not belittling comedians.
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but even if I'm told that being a comedian is a difficult job and that I have to reach the top of the peak, it's still okay.
It sounds like justification for one's own career beautification and comedians having too high a standing in the media and society.
Honestly, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel that it's becoming increasingly difficult to be involved in the entertainment industry.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product ordered from the Tsutomu Net Shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse but received the wired version instead, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
Although the topic is more about online shopping troubles than building a PC, I can't agree with it no matter how I think about it, so I will write about it here since it is a well-known place.
The starting point was when I discovered that during the Tsutaya Net Shop Tsutaya Day Sale that started from the previous Friday, MSI wireless gaming mice were being sold for 3,280 yen (Linked to Fish Tank).
Since the wired version was the same price in the store, I checked the page for the wired version to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Tako), so I ordered it considering that it was not a mistake.
The order email was received successfully and the shipping email arrived the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in both of these emails and in the purchase history of my page.
From the lack of miscommunication or cancellation notifications from the time of ordering to shipping, I assumed that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
The problem started when an email came a few hours after shipping saying that there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email.
We were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
Since we have already shipped wired mice,
Refuse delivery and cancel in full.
2. Return only the mouse for a refund.
You can use the wired mouse as it is.
You can choose the compatibility.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note all stated wireless version.
Isn't it cruel to expect us to pay for return shipping if we receive a product that is different from the one we purchased without our knowledge and want a refund?
In the end, I want to fight back and refuse to accept a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for a partner or marriage, would you not want to be with someone who has a bad relationship with their family?
Is that unrelated?
Why would you care if so?
For example, there are people who have cut ties with their parents or siblings.
I don't particularly care.
Bad relationships can also exist between parents and siblings when there are people with different personalities and unreasonable behavior.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the area to the outside has been washed away due to typhoons and heavy rains. Residents have tripled their stockpiles of food in Yamaki-machi, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Matsumoto from the Takagi Hara district of Yabuki-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.
Typhoon 19 in Eastern Japan in 2019 had a big impact on the lives of three households of eight people.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first, it was like 'Seriously?'
"I felt like it was all gone so quickly, like it was swept away," Takahigahara Bridge, the only road connecting Takahigahara district, was swept away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 30 people from 11 households in the district isolated.
The residents forced to endure the water cut continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not open to traffic, to transport the necessary supplies.
Mr. Matsumoto: "Normally I can drive to the garden, but this time I had to get off the car and carry or carry my luggage to cross the bridge and come here, so I felt the convenience of the means of transportation, the car. "The emergency bridge completed a month later was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was installed due to a heavy rain in less than three months.
Even though recovery has progressed more than two years after the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about ten cases.
For now, I think we should try to secure enough supplies for two to three days. We have tripled the amount of food such as canned goods and cup noodles that can be used for emergency rations compared to before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto: "I felt again that it's better to prepare a little, because you never know when a disaster might strike you personally, not someone else's. Meanwhile, Yatsushiro Town experienced an 'unexpected disaster' with the bridge being washed away."
To not forget the lesson, the town started its own initiatives from 2021.
Yamagi Town Education Department, Takahashi Ryuichi Section Chief: "We have announced that we would like October 12th to be a day to think about disaster prevention in the form of 'Yamagi Town Disaster Prevention Day', and we hope to continue this in the future."
I think awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has been increasing even more recently.

I'm sorry. It seems like there might be support groups out there, but I don't know anything about them... I'm sorry.
As far as I can remember, in Hiro Yuki's videos, people who had trouble getting along with their parents were told to go to organizations that could provide them with food, clothing, and shelter, and that if they went, something could be done for them (I can't remember exactly). So I guess there must be such organizations.
Experience para-marathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated course of the Paralympic marathon.
This event was held to allow people to experience the new fun of sports and the appeal of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were available, and visitors could put on the special equipment and run the virtual Paralympic marathon course reproduced in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, participants' avatars appear and they can experience a marathon-like competition with participants from both inside and outside the country, while also enjoying sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said... "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun."
"It's tough running through the streets of Tokyo, but it's really fun to be able to run and enjoy it, and I'm glad I was able to compete with everyone and make it to the end," said the Tokyo official, who also said they want to make it possible for people to have fun at sports gyms and plan to set them up after the New Year.

Be careful when buying a used home!
"What are the Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System?" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system has been successful in promoting used housing transactions.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of owning a house has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large scale", and "tower" have become popular, and this has also affected the sharp decrease in the relatively cheaper newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing circulation in Japan still remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, aimed at ensuring the safe and secure transaction of used homes (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is knowledgeable about housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that introducing inspections can bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property inspection prior to the transaction, which can give the buyer peace of mind.
This can also lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase, and it is said to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for leading the building condition survey is mainly the seller.
In addition, it is important to note that only the announcement of the inspection system is mandatory.
In other words, real estate agents who are in charge of mediation have the obligation to explain whether they can or cannot introduce an architect to carry out a building condition survey when mediating a property, but the actual implementation is not mandatory.
Turning our eyes overseas, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used car market is thriving, a similar system has already been established, eliminating the risk of seller-led inspections.
Before purchasing a home, there is a system in place where buyers can request an inspection of the building from professionals such as inspectors and building surveyors.
For example, in the US, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of cases involving the sale of a used home, depending on the state.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its characteristics differ greatly from the seller-oriented one.
The sellers will try to show the condition of the building as favorably as possible, and to sell it at the highest price and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyers are carefully examining the survey results and thinking of making the necessary repairs to ensure a safe and comfortable living.
Even with the same inspection, there can be a discrepancy between the objectives and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks to be concerned about regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection prescribed by the country shall be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, intermediaries (sellers) who introduce them to the projects they are responsible for can also be referred to as customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility of inspections being conducted with "leniency" such as not reporting unfavorable inspection results to the seller.

Was Ginza an island?
Five pieces of trivia to talk about while silver-blading (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula.
As proof of that, only in Ginza can you show off your trivia knowledge with phrases like "Did you know...?"
Here is an interesting fact about Ginza that you may want to share with someone after learning it.
Let's go up Ginza! ?
Infiltration of the Golden Throne
As you walk around Ginza, you can find traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As they were walking through Ginza, the sudden silence was broken by her saying, "This used to be a peninsula back in the day."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The symbol of bustling areas that have created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, Ginza in Tokyo's Chuo Ward.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a silver mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawamachi", but when it moved to Ginza it became known by its nickname "Ginza".
Incidentally, it is said that the area near Ginza was once a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a peninsula called Edo-mae-shima stretched from Hibiya to Ginza, and a bay extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the canals and improved the districts to promote boat transportation.
Then, the soil from the moat was cut away and Kanda Mountain was cut down and used to fill in the inlet.
Why not take a look around if you're interested, as there is a monument of "The Birthplace of Ginza" in front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), which indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office.
The "pilgrimage" of Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, Ginza hosts the "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Tour", a pilgrimage known only to those in the know.
Among the more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki-cho Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za.
At the shrine standing at the right end of the Kabuki-za theater, there are also few people who pray before and after watching the play.
On the other hand, the "Ryūkō Fudōson" is located on the roof of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and the "Ginza Shusse Jizōson" is located on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi's Ginza Terrace.
The Toyoiwai Inari Shrine, Azuma Inari Shrine, and Hōgan Inari Shrine are located in the back alleys and are not very noticeable, but the Toyoiwai Inari Shrine is known for being worshipped by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon. The Success Inari Shrine located on the 1F entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachō Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most of the shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
Inari shrines, which have a fox statue at the entrance, were built enthusiastically in many farming areas to pray for the benefits of a stable rice harvest and abundant harvests, known as "Gokoku Horyo".
This in turn led to the belief that it was beneficial for business to flourish in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, Japan's most bustling city, faith spread.

I went through all the tutorials on CKWiki, but there's only information on how to make a completely original mod.

A man's body was found near the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS - Yahoo! News).
On the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Sono River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to police, a passerby spotted a man collapsed face down in the Sho-nai River on the west side of Nakashidami in Moriyama at around 11:30 a.m. on the 12th and reported it to the police.
The man was rescued from the river, but his death was confirmed at the scene.
The police are urgently confirming the identity and investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the Sunagawa River in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disarray in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are quickly confirming identities and investigating the situation at the time.

Posco International of South Korea has acquired Senex Energy of Australia and plans to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News).
Poseidon International announced on the 12th that it had concluded agreements for the acquisition of shares in Senex Energy, an Australian company, and for investments towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the remaining procedures such as the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Senex Energy and the approval of the local corporation, the acquisition procedures are scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Postcon International was integrated into the Postcon Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount was set at 770.9 billion won, with Posco International investing 50.1% and Hanhock Energy investing 49.9%.
Poseco International explained that it decided to make the acquisition this time, seeing that the demand for natural gas is increasing sustainably even in the energy transition era, and blue hydrogen based on natural gas is dividing the market with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Poseidon International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for onshore gas field operations in Australia.

Could the knee pain be osteoarthritis?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor: Recently, I've been having persistent knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is osteoarthritis.
Editor: Does that mean the joints will deform?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to cushion shocks and make the movement of the joint smooth.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become misaligned.
As a result, it can cause deformities and inflammation of the joints.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis also affect joints other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Arthritis can also occur in other joints such as the fingers, base of the thumb, neck, lower back, big toe, and hip.
However, the most common case affecting the knee is called "osteoarthritis of the knee joint".
Editor: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by two bones fitting together in a concave and convex shape.
The part where the two bones meet is covered with articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editor: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called synovium, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid also serves as a lubricant, composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making knee movement smoother, which is why.
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: The articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushioning role, isn't it?
However, if this is worn down or distorted, it can deform the joint and cause inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
Although I usually sleep in pajamas, when my pajamas are in the wash I sleep in a tracksuit or something!
Are there some heavy smokers who can quit smoking, and some who cannot?
Yes, there are two types.

You can actually experience the "Kaiji" series of gambling & game 3 selections (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The "Kaiji" series of gambling manga, boasting explosive popularity among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where life is at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tremble... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to try verifying the game of Kaiji that can be played in reality or implemented in planning videos.
The "Numa" pachinko, which appeared in "Kaiji: Tobaku Mokushiroku", is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaiji was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-Step Curtain" set up, and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaizi resorted to all sorts of measures, eventually placing a vinyl tank in the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, and succeeded in conquering it brilliantly.
The "swamp" featured in Kaiji has been released as a pachinko game and is played by many people.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
■Crossing the Iron Beam At the Star Side Party, which was held as entertainment for the wealthy, debtors including Kaiji were made to participate in a human horse racing, which was a crossing of the iron beam.
The debtors must proceed carefully on the narrow steel frame installed ten meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win the prize, but there are only four iron bars and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this steel bridge walk is highly dangerous, it can be experienced very closely at the Eagle Bridge installed at the home ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
The Eagle Bridge rises to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to seven floors of a building), and from there a steel bridge leads to the SkyBungee and the Victory Bridge, which can be reached by foot.
Of course, safety measures have been taken.
Comedian Koara Korin released a video on his YouTube channel walking across the Eagle Bridge as "the experience of steel girder crossing in Japan" and it became a topic of conversation.
"E-Card" is a two-player card game.
Using 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, the players are divided into two teams: Emperor and Slave.
This game is very well made, with the emperor being strong to the citizens, the citizens being strong to the slaves, and the slaves being strong to the emperor.
In the movie, Kaiji battles against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ear shaved off.
After a long and difficult battle, Kaiji realized that his opponent was reading his mind through a device attached to his ear like an earphone, which detected and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature. He then succeeded in disrupting the Rindo-gawa by shaving his ear to its extreme limits and altering his body to abnormal values.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which gained a lot of attention.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to experience the world view through the game?
Gently pushing forward the first step into the new year, a large "Tora no E-ma" was placed in Yamagata Prefecture's Gokoku Shrine. | Yamagata Shimbun
At Yamagata City's Gokoku Shrine, where preparations for the new year are underway, a large votive horse for the coming year's zodiac sign, the Tiger, has appeared.
On the 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from the University of Arts to create the original artwork for the ema since the year before last.
This time, the work of Yuichi Doi (22), one of the nine students of the Japanese painting course supervised by Professor Sue naga Toshiaki, was selected.
The large votive tablet has a width of 3.3 meters and a height of approximately 1.8 meters at its center.
Tsuchiya said he painted an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing people forward as they step into the new year.
Stopping in its tracks, the tiger gazing at the cherry blossoms held a wish that even in a rapidly changing world, it could still find the time to appreciate the beauty of nature.
Tsuchiya's designs have also been featured on the ema generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonenki said, "I think we can be a helping hand for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

"Let's Think About Tamano We Want to Keep Living In" - Proposals from Four High School Students in the City at the Workshop: San-Deji Digital, Yamaguchi Shimbun
What will Tamano look like in 2030?
The student representatives from the four high schools in Tamano City are working on a workshop to think about "a Tamano to live in" together.
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center", we will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor.
"What makes you feel joyful?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answered in unison, such as when they were getting excited with many people or when they were drumming.
The first event held at the Hinode Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed topics such as "interesting town", "livable town", and "town with a sense of purpose" using the World Cafe method, where each person moves to a different "island" with a predetermined theme.
We wrote down each idea on sticky notes and organized them on a mock-up paper.
"Cities with a lot of young people seem interesting," "Public transportation such as trains and buses are essential for livability."
Let's talk further to see if there are any common points.
"I thought Tamao was boring, but being able to go cycling by the sea is attractive," said an 18-year-old third-year student at Tamao Commercial High School.
The 18-year-old student from Binnan High School seemed to have noticed not only the issues in the area but also its charm by talking with adults about how there are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it is a nature-rich place.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor, education director, etc. to announce in February next year.
Touriei's president of the same center has stated that "by providing opportunities for high school students to foster a sense of local pride and for young people to actively participate in community development".

Finding New Ways to Wrap a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
In winter, don't you sometimes find that the scarf slips off your neck?
I sometimes hear people say that they don't quite understand the technique of balancing the hairstyle after winding it, so it is best to look in the mirror while doing it.
When I was hoping for a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, I found something innovative.
The COTORI brand of scarves have a compact size with a length of approximately one meter, shorter than the average size.
I was amazed at how short it could be rolled up when I saw it for the first time.
Upon closer inspection, it is made from narrow strips of cloth woven together into one piece, and the whole fabric is in a net-like pattern.
The mesh is designed to allow the ends of the yarn to pass through.
Therefore, you can secure it without tying the ends together by winding it.
It is very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, vests without sleeves are popular, but many people will combine them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think having this kind of stole will be very convenient.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting!
Get Buck is the one directed by Peter Jackson.
The Beatles feel so real and life-sized, and it's all so fresh...
Even though there's some tension right before disbanding, it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying his best to keep things in order, there was Paul, who was a bit of a pain with his "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" and George, who was grumbling with his "But still~" and John, who was relatively calm with his opinions and jokes but was always late and lacked motivation. And then there was Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat there with a "Oh, this is troublesome" face.
They didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very common feeling of "It's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had that same feeling. It's like a legendary dismantling or something.
And in that atmosphere, when the performance began, everyone was overflowing with talent.
It's amazing how we can start with a small phrase and exchange "how about this?" to eventually come up with a great song.
In particular, the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is completed is amazing.
The scene where a casual hum-hum-huhn gradually changed into the zucha♪zucha♪ and lyrics were added was recorded perfectly, which was amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this so rarely.
Of course, everyone is so passionate when they play, so just watching the performance can make you feel happy.
Although it's only one episode out of three, so far my impression is that the main cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.
Although the four of them grumbled about it, they seemed to enjoy writing songs, but when it came to finding a place for the live performance, people like producers and promoters started talking in a Beatles-like manner, saying "Let's make them the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that they had taken the reins from the band members.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it could be that what Peter Jackson felt is coming out...
I thought that maybe the reason why there were so many scenes where Paul seemed like the villain was because he was supervising it.

In the US, there have been large-scale damages due to the frequent occurrence of tornadoes, influenced by unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From Friday night to Saturday, tornadoes occurred frequently in the southern United States.
It is believed that due to the strong cold air moving south, which was unusually warm for this time of year, the atmosphere became very unstable and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest is flowing into the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, temperatures are expected to reach near 30°C on Thursday and Friday local time.
Due to the strong cold air flowing south at around 5500m above the ground, which was unusually warm, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes were occurring one after another in the area.
The southern United States is generally an area prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
During the winter season, the tornado warnings issued in one day reached nearly 150, which was a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 cases of tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday, 10th local time.
According to this, it can be seen that there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side including Illinois.
In Kentucky, an EF3 tornado was reported on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with gusts of wind up to 70 m/s at its peak.
Further investigations may also reveal the possibility of typhoons with an intensity of EF4 to EF5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is adapted to the condition of Japanese buildings based on the Modified Fujita Scale.
The JEF3 tornado equivalent to the one in the US could also occur in Japan with a high probability, with the potential to collapse wooden houses.

Voices from the "greatest disaster in history" in Kure are also asking for help through live broadcasts (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression, describing it as "one of the worst tornadoes in American history".
It was reported by outlets such as CNN in the US.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can."
They explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of fatalities will exceed 100.
[Photo] In Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado, residents were seen carrying furniture and other items from damaged homes. At least 30 tornadoes occurred in six states, including Kentucky, from the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th.
The record of 219 miles (350 kilometers) of damage to Missouri and other states in 1925 remains as the range of damage caused by the tornado, but CNN meteorologists also estimated that this time it was the largest scale of about 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Mayfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that had been operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season also suffered tremendous damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remains.
In the darkness, the woman who had become immobile under the rubble of about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of the rescuers searching above the rubble, and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
The live broadcast also featured the sound of a woman singing "Happy Birthday To You" while crying, seemingly to distract from the fear, in addition to the cries for help from another woman.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when the tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people likened it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumbling from the ground," he said, looking back.
The police officers of Meifield City Police stated that they will continue their search operations until it is no longer necessary.
Despite not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take, they kept up their dedicated rescue efforts.
In Illinois, part of an Amazon warehouse collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The shock of the earthquake was so strong that trains derailed, and highways were blocked due to overturned vehicles.
According to US media, around 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, have been affected by power outages.
I have a low number of platelets.
What should I do to do more?
Consume high-protein foods and drinks.

It would be good to do things like that.

There has been an old saying that there are different opinions about the star-based rating system.
In contrast to other countries which use a five-star system and deduct points from there, Japan has the claim that three stars are considered neutral and points are added or deducted from there.
At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean "there are points to be deducted" and "not a masterpiece but a good work", which is completely different.
If we use five stars as the basis, then "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest standard" are placed on the same level, so if that is the tendency, then it would be a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since it is actually being used in such a system, it is understandable that you would not want to give three stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, trying to refute people who make such claims with Steam's binary rating system will not work.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fits a standard hose size?
The power capacity from USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
Submersible pumps vary depending on the type, but at least 500W is consumed, so it's impossible.

The Homemade Radio Reel
I made an AM radio using my own capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but I could also hear a different radio station than the one I was tuned to.
The tuning might have been too loose so it didn't sound clear, but it was different from the expected station, right?
Here's the main point, I made an AM radio but it seems like I can hear FM radio.
What do you think the reason is? Is something like that even possible?

I understand the risks and don't plan to do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.

Thank you for your contribution.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" "Fried Fish and Shrimp from the Nearby Sea with Homemade Tartar Sauce" | Living and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunchbox "Fried seasonal fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
"Hakobune", a take-out specialty store offering colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) made with plenty of vegetables.
Kazuyuki and Yumi Kogetsu, a married couple in their late thirties, opened the restaurant in August last year with the aim of allowing customers to experience the feeling of a restaurant even at home.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly Caught Seasonal Fish and Shrimp Fry with Homemade Tartar Sauce" (1000 yen).
When buying fish at the market, choose the best of the moment.
"We make the batter with as little breadcrumbs as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be felt directly," says Takayuki, and with shrimp tempura, the light and fluffy texture is immediately recognizable.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side vegetables, portioned Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and soup.
Vegetables were purchased either from the nearby fields or from the local direct sales outlets.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Kiyoshi-san, who has studied French cuisine, adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, they provide a fusion of Japanese and Western flavors that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, such as the "comforting taste of rolled omelette" (Yumi-san).
The bento box "Japanese minced meat hamburger steak" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
We will also launch a "Charcuterie Set" of processed meat to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages next year.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but there may be occasional shaking (not to the point of feeling dizzy).
Of course, it is slow.
I think it's safe because it slows down or even stops completely when there are people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It hurts to feel the gaze of those around me; it's not bad to be seen, but it feels like I'm in the way and it hurts my heart.
Overall verdict: Not bad, but still room for improvement.
It is unfortunate that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could be asked to move to the side.
Specifically, we thought it would be best to create dedicated lanes so that cyclists don't interfere with pedestrians.
I thought it would be a great ride if there were fewer people, since it was relaxed and I could take my time to enjoy the scenery.
It was a difficult ride, as it was a combination of excitement from the near-future feeling of autonomous driving becoming mainstream, and the pleasantness of the pain from the stares of those around me, and one had to have a strong heart to endure it.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you might understand a little bit, but this is an Ese Una Don that doesn't use any eel at all.
Actually, it's "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the answer)!
I like eel, but I thought everyone just ate it with sauce and that it didn't really matter how it was cooked other than the doneness. But then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I didn't want eels to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
Recipe Used: Eggplant “Unagi” - Woks of Life (Sprinkled with Japanese pepper instead of scallions.)
I just fried the steamed one in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.

On the 12th, a man was slashed and escaped on a motorcycle in an attempted murder in Saga City Daizai | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed in the face with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, suffering injuries.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and Saga Minami Police Station is trying to trace his whereabouts as a attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, a 110 call was made by passersby who reported a fight.

The man who ran away was medium-built with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.

Families in China's border regions have a long journey ahead of them to establish environmental protection activities (JBpress - Yahoo! News).
(Yuki Kato: Find Asia Corporate Consultant in Hong Kong) China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
There are also areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection by local governments but also the activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan-Tibet-Yunnan (Xishuangbanna) in Southwest China is also one of these regions.
My sister, Li Wenda, is currently active as an actress. Sisaket is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group, which shares its roots with the Thai people of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture covers only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Mr. Li Min-guo in Sisaket, who is engaged in environmental protection activities, and to hear about the content of his activities.
She and her German husband started environmental protection activities 20 years ago.
What was the cause of it?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activities "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The impetus for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
Her husband is from Germany and came to Si Sa Phan Na for a joint UN-China scientific project.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts a number of biological diversities.
However, economic development was still lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests took place in order to root industries in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
He was sent here from Germany to work on the recovery of natural resources and research on biological resources.
And here I met someone I knew through being a journalist, and we got married.
― ― Did Mr. Li have any interest in conservation before that?
Mr. Li, I am from Cispanana, but I was not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, she had to push the project forward with her husband without the knowledge.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or a tall stature, why do you think there are people who have an aura about them that you sometimes see?

Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.

That person surely has a strong confidence within themselves.

I don't think it's too detailed.
I've never been told to be specific with praise, so I'm not sure what that means.
Maybe something like praising in detail?
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"My heart is in full bloom after being confessed to by Sakura-san. I'm the one who should be thanking you," he replied, continuing the relationship.

【Omakan / Personal Note】 Something that caused a CTD in the MOD self-environment and took about one and a half months to identify.
Until March, due to the lack of playtime and multiple causes of CTD occurring around GW, we had to investigate mainly on holidays, which made it very difficult to identify the cause in a timely manner.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes do not remain in the crash logs.
Main timing of the CTD
All Papyrus and .Net Script Framework logs, as well as logs from .dll plug-ins that leave a trace, will not leave a footprint.
For some NPC killing/attacking accumulation: Activates even with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement. Is there a possibility of script overload for this?
For some NPCs, camera work for kill moves can be improved by turning off kill move settings via .ini files, avoiding setting conflicts between DAR and Nemesis. However, the upper limit is not even close to 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoors) Field movement + some magic (e.g. Ice Bind Rune) activation, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID usage NPC application setting (MCM upper right) all OFF, 5 consecutive attempts to improve everything.
Could this be due to additional armor or body mesh shader settings misconfigured for some actors/NPCs? Also, although there may be formatting errors in the 2.0 SPID usage default.ini, the result should be as intended and the pre-requisite Perks should be applied to NPCs.
At first, we focused on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MODs (.dlls) by wearing wet clothes, and this was the result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
In case there are people who have the same CTD problem in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be useful to post it as a reference in case it is helpful.
Everyone was doing it with a tight mental state.
Not even their colleagues or family noticed it.
When looking around, there are times when one can think optimistically that someone is struggling yet still working hard with enthusiasm.
However, he is probably pushing himself to the limit mentally as well.
I haven't officially resigned due to mental health reasons, but I think I was at my limit right before resigning.
Thinking about the importance of psychiatric visiting nursing-after today's visiting nursing is finished
Because I have bipolar disorder, I have been receiving home care for a long time, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home care station I am currently using.
Every week, we have various conversations.
Of course, they also provide necessary things for medication management (such as one-package system), but more than anything, today's home visit made me realize how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illness.
Today we also had a discussion or a chat about gender differences and gender theories.
In home nursing, we also discuss topics such as gender desire and why she got divorced, etc.
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard stories from acquaintances about visiting nursing stations in psychiatric hospitals where elderly nurses who can no longer work in wards come and provide only administrative support, and where occupational therapists who come for visiting nursing are given orders in a condescending manner, such as "We are providing medical care here".
The visiting nursing station I use is run by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses are really good because they face me, who has a mental illness, on an equal footing and frankly.
By the way, she is a beauty, haha.
There are those who are already receiving psychiatric home visits, and those who are considering it.
Visiting nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, definitely get it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I was unable to come to an agreement no matter what, and there were even times when I had to terminate the contract from my side.
I'm sorry for the poor writing.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Edition) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced its hydrogen economy roadmap.
The content was that by 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles would be spread (cumulatively) and 310 hydrogen stations would be operated nationwide.
The target price for hydrogen was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles had not exceeded the target of 27% (about 17,000 units).
The target for the adoption of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the cost of hydrogen per kilogram is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's performance of the hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target value.
The Japan Association of Economic and Social Research (Zenkeiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on December 12.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the US and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of patents related to hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative), South Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, Keidanren conveyed that "in effect, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are actually in a lower position among the competing countries."
The patent rankings by country are China, USA, EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
Although South Korea registered 1,033 patents in 2020, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to rank fourth, it only accounted for 22% of China's total of 4,721 patents.
The Keidanren proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large investment and research and development tax deduction.
It has been a month and a half since I had surgery to cut the muscles in my finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is slightly swollen and when I move my hand, the affected area feels a stinging pain.
Will this heal on its own?
It can heal naturally, but it takes quite a bit of time.
Even though it may be painful, if we don't do rehabilitation, we won't be able to move, so let's do rehabilitation.

Compared to now, were women in the workplace from the Meiji to the Showa period a minority?
I think the sister had many fiancés.
It has become so common to say the term "sister-in-law wife".
And, in those days, it was said that you should "even if you have to wear golden sandals, look for her" when looking for a wife who was one year older, so I think that in the Meiji and Showa eras there were more wives who were older than now.

Today, the PS5 was being sold for 70,000 yen at the store.
It is legal.
In a free market, for example, if the scarcity value of a branded item increases compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered lawful for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its scarcity value and not just an increase in value from the original retail price.

As part of the council reform in Takasu, council members' "communication books" are also being created in the style of a TV program: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
Takasu Town Council is undertaking unique council reforms such as creating an eye-catching flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "Communication Book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council elections are aiming for three consecutive terms without voting in order to get the citizens interested.
To spread awareness of the Sunday Assembly on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Live Giron from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had phrases that evoked popular television shows.

The US has arrived in Ukraine with aid weapons and ammunition, and is also involved in training troops (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) US State Department officials reported that by 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine based on the security assistance package approved by President Biden.
The military aid package is worth a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to a Pentagon spokesman, the aid also included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile Javelin.
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's reinforcement of forces around the Ukrainian border.
The US is on high alert for Russian military movements, consulting with NATO member countries and preparing for a response in case Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden had approved military aid when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House on September 1st this year.
The US military aid to Ukraine has reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, US National Guard personnel from Florida were sent in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to the statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe are playing a major role in training and advising Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is kept secret as a matter of operational security.
On the 7th of this month, President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin, and there was a tense exchange regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The US has also shown a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

We directly question Amano, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission, on the fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that would make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand"!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with Family During the New Year's Holidays"!
It is called "Advance Gift and Last-Minute Inheritance Technique".
While the discussion on the integration of inheritance and gift taxes progresses, the proposed tax reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year was not included, but there is a high possibility that the pre-death gift, which is the main measure for inheritance tax, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In a direct interview with former Tax Commission Chairman, Kanemaru Shigeru, he will teach everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques, in order to make it in time for the end of the year and get the most out of your last-minute gifts.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Keiaki Miyahara)
From wealthy people to urban company employees, "prohibition of pre-death gifts" is used, and "from the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer" ― ―.
In the 2021 Tax Reform Outline announced by the ruling party last year, a great disturbance spread not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because what it implies is to change the rules of inheritance and to increase inheritance tax by prohibiting the "gift before death" which is the orthodox measure for inheritance tax countermeasures.
The golden rule for reducing the highly progressive inheritance tax is to reduce the taxable assets.
The strongest trump card of lifetime gifts has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of integrating the inheritance and gift taxes has arisen.
Although it was not included in the Tax System Reform Outline for Fiscal Year 2022 announced on December 10th, which had been feared to be introduced at the fastest speed, more detailed phrases such as "review the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-tax measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted)... continuous review" were again proposed as a policy towards integration.
In an interview with the editorial staff, former chairman of the Tax System Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party, Masaaki Kanemaru, said.
It is most important to avoid any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing of asset transfer and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration. If the amendment is made at the fastest speed, the remaining chances for lifetime gifts will be reduced to three.
Even without that, it seems certain that in the near future, a major step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how will the rules for inheritance and gift taxes specifically change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
Starring Kana Yamaya as the heroine, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story of a man and a woman carrying the past, based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Satoshi, serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018.
Furukawa plays the protagonist Kairi, and Yamatani Kajun plays the heroine Rise.
Rise, a college student, met her senior Kaori at her part-time job.
Kairi, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder.
Rise is drawn to Haru, who has similar features to her brother whom she was separated from due to her parents' divorce, but could Haru be a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yudai Furukawa Comment The drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
We hope that those who have not yet seen it on FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex psychological portrayal of Kairi and Risae, their conflicts and changes, as they watch it.
I am delighted if even fans of the original can enjoy it.
Look forward to it!

What were the feelings of the players on the team that won with only three passes in one game (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones of the Patriots only threw three passes during the game.
This was only a few attempts since the two passes the Bills recorded in their 1974 Week 3 game against the New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bills had the once-in-a-lifetime genius RB O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in NFL history.
Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another RB, Jim Brockston.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada and has the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with winds of 18 m/s blowing and snow falling before the game.
Bills, being from the local area, didn't change his play selection much.
The passes were 30 times, while the runs were 25 times.
Allen's shot was 15/30, 145 yards.
There were no interceptions and they were far from incompetent.
There were four red zone entries and scoring opportunities in the ten offensive series.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced three times in a row to the red zone.
However, they were only able to get three points from one of the three field goals.
Defending in front of the goal in the final stages of the game.
The Bills, attempting to close the gap to 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
On 3rd&14, QB Allen escaped the pocket to the right, surrounded by the Patriots' rush.
He then threw a pass towards tight end Dorson Knox in the endzone, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, Ace WR Stephen Diggs was running a slant route and was free in the end zone on the right side, but it seems Allen didn't catch it in his sights.
On 4th & 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis on the left side, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in a failed attempt.
Bryant was covering the Bills' WR Call Beasley man-to-man, but he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen threw two passes aiming for the end zone, having missed two receivers.
The pass on 4th down may have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on 3rd down.
They should be able to get a first down in two plays.
Before it was still two minutes, Allen's ability to run with the ball should have been alive if he had chosen 4th & Short.

It's time to choose three items that are often kept in the kitchen for a long time and need to be replaced or thrown away (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
Even if you replace it frequently, it is probably not as often as recommended for sponges.
Research from 2017 has shown that even if kitchen sponges are disinfected in a microwave every day, bacteria can still proliferate (although it is still recommended to disinfect them in a microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing sponges once a week to maintain cleanliness.
Cutting board
The US Department of Agriculture also recommends replacing cutting boards when they become scratched or grooved.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, as bacteria can multiply.
In case it is still safe, do not forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Wipe the water off with clean paper towels or let it dry naturally after washing it with clean water.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked.
Disposing of your favorite mug may be heartbreaking, but the broken surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
Additionally, it can also be the cause of cuts on the lips or spilling of drinks.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Guan Yu, the submerged righteous general, shouted "Oi, Yu Jin!"

"So can we take on the underwater bridge and hold out underwater for three quarters of an hour?"
"Wuss-wuss!"
"So make sure to practice so you can endure until the next battle at the castle!"
"Woo-hoo!"
Is that a promise?
"Got it!"
"You won't know until you are killed by Cao Cao!"
Saying that, the righteous general went back.
Of course, there's no way we're doing underwater bridge three-minute drills! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and submerge them in a cage.

The Community Market and trading are two different things.
The Community Market allows you to use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers in Red, so there are people who have been scammed by having items taken without payment.
That will not happen.
Trading is a feature that allows players to exchange items or give them as gifts, but does not allow for buying and selling.
Is occupation and employment type a separate topic?
I can't even understand why I would think it's the same story.
Even for simple labor, there are cases of regular employees, and for intellectual labor, there are also cases of non-regular employees.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish.
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I replaced the B550 and RAM I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, a black screen with a white cursor-like dot stayed without blinking.
Even if you try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS is damaged, it won't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end even after an hour.
The possible causes could be that the USB memory tested is too old, or using an SD card with an adapter.
Are you feeling tired from oversleeping?
Are there any other similar causes?

Having branded items is embarrassing for some reason.
You can carry something inconspicuous, but you can't carry something like Louis Vuitton with its monogrammed LV.
Why?
I think it's best to choose something that fits your size.
I think it would be great if it were in Japan.
In Japan, it is important.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
You should say it sooner, "Why am I the only one using informal language?"
If it comes to the point where they say "But doesn't it matter because they're a foreigner?", it's best to simply say that it's unpleasant.
I don't think I even dream of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly good probability.
I lived abroad for a while, and the Japanese people who went out there, including me, disliked the Confucian hierarchical customs. There were quite a few people there, and I think they misunderstood that we could say whatever we wanted to the locals.
If it looks like Westerners, I think it's done without any malice, as if it's a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling.
Even among my friends who are from the West, there are moments when I'm a bit unsure whether to use their first name or honorifics when speaking in Japanese.
Well, it's still okay with friends.
It's just something that you normally do, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say it now.
Could you please speak according to the rules of Japan, since this is Japan?
Heuristic: Even though it's unrelated, my white friend who is naturalized always raises his glass higher than the others when making a toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if I do it that way, I won't be treated strangely by people younger or older than me, like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, tend to be people who pay attention to such small details (including myself), so there are a lot of them.

Thank you to the 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created subreddit had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy!
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, yesterday the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
For those who subscribed to this sub-reddit today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could tell us in the comments section where you found out about this sub-reddit! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Since there is currently only one person creating threads, it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.
It would be encouraging if you could leave comments even without creating a thread.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than Reddit, even though some may be using Reddit.
People who use Twitter, please start a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The previous sub-event didn't gather as many people as I had hoped and I was about to give up, but thanks to everyone this time, I think I can keep going without giving up.
We will also be working hard to maintain the wiki and rules, etc. to make the subreddit more user-friendly, so please look forward to it in the future!
As expected, there was no snow accumulation.
It's just cold rain.
I think if they keep making such exaggerated forecasts, viewers won't believe them.
Did it accumulate in the metropolitan area?
Please pour some water!
Since I only have a limited understanding of English, I rely solely on the translated text.
The translated text may feel a bit off, but I understand the message and think it is at a level where it won't be a hindrance to playing (I think it's best to hear the opinion of others as well as my own).
I often see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like they are usually well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it is a matter of whether they can reach the point of understanding the subtle nuances of the Japanese language even after studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, it might be better to look for someone else.

Also, please tell me why it would be meaningless to move near my parents' house.
I think there are various reasons why people want to live alone, regardless of where they are, so it depends on the individual how they think about it.

In "Kimetsu no Yaiba," it can be concluded that training is essential for battles.
"Equal exchange of effort" is a human praise <Anime "Yukaku-hen" Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes Kimetsu no Yaiba particularly unique among recent shounen manga is the abundance of training.
Generally speaking, it has become a conventional wisdom that stories in which the protagonist trains without any battles, day or night, are not popular among readers.
Even in the same Jump manga ONE PIECE, when the Straw Hat Pirates separated, there was two years of training, but it should be inferred from the fact that it was only touched upon and the rest was glossed over.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is the eccentricity of the places it visits, but staying in the same place and training doesn't always go well together.
It can be said that Tanjiro's training began when he kneeled before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged him to take Nezuko's life, to which Giyu replied, "Do not entrust the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are only forced to submit to the strong by power...
While saying that, Yushiro introduced Rin Takanashi, the "mentor" who trains the Demon Slayer Corps' applicants, as a sign of his kindness (though he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
During their first encounter, Rin asked Tanjiro, "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" Tanjiro was at a loss for words, so Rin quickly judged him as being slow to decide.
Among fans, it is a seemingly unreasonable exchange that has become a topic of conversation.
However, taking one's sister who has become a demon out for a walk carries the possibility that one may be forced to make such a judgement.
It can be said that this is an initiation into practice, starting from the right attitude.
RinTaki, who said to take Tanjiro, an inexperienced novice, to Mt. Sagiri and have him descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain was full of pitfalls, slingshots, and traps, making it seem like death was imminent before even beginning the training.
Even so, their sharp sense of smell allows them to detect the faint scent of traps set by humans, and barely manage to avoid them with their "protagonist correction".
Even so, it's the essence of Kimetsu to make Tanjiro say that "we can't suddenly become able to avoid all of it, even though our physical abilities don't suddenly become higher!"
Ordinary people do not suddenly become strong without any backing, and awakening is only to be able to use the "power and skills honed up to that point" with its original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", where those who put in effort are rewarded accordingly and those who do not put in effort are not rewarded, is a humanistic praise that is different from the supernatural power of a demon with no basis, and is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work.
Is this old?
There is still a sleeping style where you sleep directly on the floor with a mattress and futon spread out.
Because the house is not a condominium.
I'm doing that too.
If you want to make the most of the room, it's better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of those people.
Is it difficult?
Working part-time and juggling multiple jobs at other stores to work full-time, isn't it tough?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such cases, it wouldn't fit with my idea of "harsh", would it?
I also consider taking measures to get more benefit than effort with minimal effort to be "resourceful".
Are there any smoking cessation outpatients available nationwide?

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Division" integrating home appliances and mobile, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of its CE and IM divisions into the DX division, Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it will reflect this in its organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be seen that the intention is to enhance user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division, which was formed by integrating the CE and IM divisions, consists of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects a mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and the strengthening of global leadership.
They also emphasized their intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also formulated to create synergies on a company-wide scale, transcending organizational boundaries, and to build a foundation for differentiated products and services, as reflected in its name.
Already, Samsung Electronics is conceptualizing a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to enable users to freely use content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Although it is a matter of preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I would like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.

Hannemou larvae lie in wait in the sand, exposing only their disc-shaped heads, in order to catch prey at any time.
This place feels a bit unnatural.

I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about is
Did you take any other documentaries into consideration?
Viewing it from an ant's perspective?
Should we?
If we translate armoured heads as "disc-shaped heads", I think the part about "a giant monster wearing a helmet on an ant's scale" will disappear...
24-vehicle collision in Aichi, truck driver has no chronic illness, carelessness suspected (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, where 24 cars collided, it was found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution had no chronic illness and it is believed that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, a collision between 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, on National Route 41 in Komaki City resulted in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
Police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect had temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura was not suffering from any illness and it appears that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are conducting searches of the premises and investigating the situation at the time in detail.
I would like to change the circuit so that when it is connected to the outlet, the electricity will turn on when the metal button is touched.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to its focus on only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started even before the match!
In a nutshell, this four-volume series is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but it is important to note that it is not just a volume that only depicts the matches in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have various activities such as tug-of-war and special training scenes that are quite different from before, but it's not at all boring.
The feeling of the story as the tension of the century-long war gradually increases is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly amazing how this period was so precisely calculated and produced.
And before the important final match, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the third-place match between Teri-man and Ramen-man.
In addition to the luxuriousness of the card as a match, what I like is that before the match, Ramenman shouted "From now on, I'm the one to aim for!!" towards the Kinnikuman poster backstage.
He tried to hit the chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, caught the knife and stopped it, and the scene ended with both of them staring at each other in silence before parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there are also people who are passionate about Kinnikuman.
Seeing this makes me unable to help but think of their far-off future successes!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that still makes me feel as a manga artist that this is what it means!
The fight between the two ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.
Don't give up to the strength of fate alone for Kinnikuman!
That is the line.
This could be seen as a grand statement about the work itself. I think readers of Kinnikuman have been feeling that the protagonist will never lose, and somehow manages to win even without relying on his own strength.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago Sensei had already driven home the point that this option was no longer available.
With this one sentence, the readers thought, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman can defeat Robin with just his strength?"
How do we do it?
From another writer's perspective, this is like a self-imposed limitation on the part of the creator, which further stimulates the imagination with its unpredictable development.
Wow, you did an amazing thing.
Without a doubt, I think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aobayama in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
On December 12th, the winter illumination that began on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter cedar tree, along with pathways and lawns.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "We were surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find out that there was such a place here."
She said it was very beautiful and it made her feel relieved.
The illuminations, which were first planned to provide a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, are lit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there will also be a Christmas event with activities such as serving a hot pot and screening a movie.

The Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association is broadcasting from Yonezawa and relaying information about agricultural and livestock products online.
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns and JA in the Okitama area, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce", which distributes videos and sells products over the internet.
The Yamagata Aien Bujotai group made a remote appearance in the first "Nationwide Collaborative Minato (Minaato) Market TV" event planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, delivering the area's attractions along with local specialties.
The "Okitama x Minato Kaikou Project" collaboration between the Okitama region and the Port District enabled a store to be set up, which was broadcast from the Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranomachi, Yonezawa City.
Kokuda Mikai, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier", wore a stole from the Yonezawa weaving brand "Nitorto (Nitorito)" and introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
We also delivered a report on the Imoni Party with the Love Warriors.
At the Tokyo studio, comedian Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and over 300,000 registered YouTubers sampled local sake, wine, Oki beef, and Tsuyahime, among other things.
In order to convey the deliciousness to the viewers, comments such as "You can smell it even though it's a live broadcast" and "It's great with alcohol, so many delicious things" flew around in praise.

Misfortune this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out!
What happened 〜
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
The computer is powered on at this time.
2.) When I returned to the room a little while later, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan's movement had only worsened due to the decrease in room temperature (6℃).
So we decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) It won't start.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will come on for a moment and the fan will move, but it will soon stop.
After that, he said nothing.
Even when unplugging the power plug and trying again, the light only blinks for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and the ATX 20-pin and 4-pin connectors and removing all other parts, the system still won't boot.
5.) Since there has been a buzzing sound like something is hitting the fan of the PSU before, I am suspicious that the PSU might be the cause.
Later, try finding an extra ATX power supply and give it a try.
Probably.
What should I do if it doesn't work?
Should I change the case and motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last four to five years?

The 2021 Most Used Emoji Ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News
My most used emoji is the crying face emoji.
I believe emojis are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, many messaging apps and chat tools have enabled users to use emoji reactions instead of stamps.

So, what kind of emojis are everyone using?
[View all images] 2021 Most Used Emoji Ranking 2021 Top 10 Most Used Emojis Around the World!
Generally, positive and bright emojis are ranked in.
According to the source Unicode, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
The first place is occupied by emoji, which account for 5% of the total!
The first, third, and fifth "crying-laughing" emojis are really easy to use, aren't they?
Of course, let's enjoy the fun and happy times, but also the times when we mess up!
Wouldn't it be true that there are not a few people who use self-deprecating expressions even when they feel like nothing can be done and they are at a loss?
On the contrary, those who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are rare of the rare.
I want to stay true to that style.

I haven't used it before, but it seems like Sagawa Express offers free cash on delivery shipping.
If anyone is familiar with it, I would like to hear the reviews as I am thinking of trying it out.
Bulky Waste (Fee-based), Addendum> Local Collection Boxes (Small Appliances Free)
Sell it used.
Additionally, you can use Mercari and Hard Off.
Are there people who sell used PCs at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
Selling while it is still worth money may also be a wise choice.
Addendum: Rinet Japan, Information provided by /u/CheetahPresent8059.
Broken printers and old UPSs that no one will take have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's somehow being put off.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, paper money can be exchanged, but coins may not be exchanged.
Commemorative coins contain gold, so they have value.
Even though they haven't done anything wrong, there are times when you can't help but dislike them, right?
Yes, it is natural for humans to have likes and dislikes.
"There are people who dislike (someone for no reason)," that's what it's like to dislike someone.

Don't you feel discriminated against because you don't have a girlfriend?
It's not about the face, it's about the heart.
But it's sad that people are judged by their appearance.
Because you can't show your inner self.
What happened to your school sports uniform after you graduated?
I wear it as my everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before Yome started cohabiting, she was still in her pajamas, haha.
Is it possible to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even after 90 or 100 years old?
However, all desires and youthfulness will be lost.
If you are healthy.
The men's volleyball team advanced to the finals for the first time in 29 years! / Men's fencing's Freel finished in 4th place and did not win a medal.
Dragon Japan, 29 years later, 8th place! The Japanese men's volleyball team has advanced to the final tournament. Coach Nakaguchi: "It was a big goal."
When he lost the third set in the Referee Challenge x2, he thought it was over, but he won the full set.
The men's foil team from Japan was unable to win a medal, losing to the United States.
I think they were a cut above the opponents we faced in the semi-finals, so why are they in the third-place game?
I would like to plant a tree in the garden that will act as a screen, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
Ideally, I would like a evergreen tree that is easy to care for and preferably produces fruit.
I look forward to working with you.
Planting other fruiting trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby will help Fayjoua bear fruit.
How much savings would each person need to comfortably cohabit?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and how you manage the relationship.
It is better to stop cohabitating.
There is a high possibility of separation.
It is better to hire a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal shops, and have a wedding and reception.
There are no benefits to living together.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played the arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-released legendary rare (^_^;)
Would you be interested in hobbies such as card games like Ganbarizing?
I think it's an ant.
