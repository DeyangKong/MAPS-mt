When I tried to buy an entry package, a blue and orange package came out.
The price is more than double for the orange one.
What's different?
I couldn't find it out by researching, so please tell me.
There should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They are the same, except for the appearance.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who is stronger if they fight with the same height and weight?
Jiu-Jitsu
Generally, karate only practices sparring with each other.
Because Jiu-Jitsu, especially Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, involves practicing dealing with strikes and more.

Since there are things like that, I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was too much? Television is all about entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
Clearly it's not funny, but it's creepy how people say "you have to laugh at everything the comedian says because they're popular".
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be ruined, and it would be unpleasant in terms of working together.
It's like a black company from the past, that industry is like a physical education club, and some entertainers' egos are too big, so they seem to have a bad attitude, and if they don't do that, they won't be able to survive.
On the other hand, many comedians emphasize the difficulty of their work by saying "Don't belittle comedians" in a way that exaggerates it.
I know that the income is quite low until it becomes popular, but it's like a comedian is standing at the top of the difficult job category even if it's said every time.
It only sounds like a justification for the fact that one's own career beautification and comedians have too high a standing in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough aspects to the industry I'm working in, but it seems like the entertainment industry is becoming increasingly unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The item I ordered from the Tsutaya Net Shop was changed without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper, and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I should return it.
Rather than talking about self-made PCs, it's an online shopping trouble, but I can't accept it no matter how I think about it, so I'll let you write it here since it's a famous place.
The trigger was that I discovered that the MSI wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen in the Tukumo Net Shop's Tukumo Day Sale, which started on the previous Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the page for the wired version to consider the possibility of a price mistake, and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Taku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order email was received normally and the shipping email was received the next day.
In both of these emails and in my page's purchase history, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the order to the shipment, since there was no contact or cancellation notification of a mistake, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
Here's the problem, a few hours after shipping we got an email saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the response
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page is divided between the wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, emails, and delivery notes all say wireless version.
Isn't it terrible that they sent something different from what I bought without my consent and want me to return it for a refund without paying for the return shipping?
In the end, I want to counterattack and accept the refund, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for a marriage partner or a partner, would you not want to associate with someone whose relationship with their family is bad?

Even with parents and siblings, there can be various personalities and unreasonable people, so the relationship can be bad.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside world was washed away due to a typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies (Yamaki Town, Fukushima Prefecture) (Fukushima Television) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho-Garahigashi district in Yamamori-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a big impact on living with 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was going to be broken so quickly, like it was going to be washed away," The only road connecting the Takachi Plain District, "Takachi Plain Bridge," was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which was usually not allowed, to transport the necessary supplies.
Mr. Kōro Matsumoto: "Usually I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry it or carry it across the iron bridge and walk here, so I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge completed one month later was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and the isolated state was restored in a few days until the temporary bridge was set up.
It has been two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I think we should at least secure two to three days' worth of food," We have stocked up on canned food and cup noodles, which can also be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, but since you don't know when a disaster will come to you, I felt again that it's better to prepare a little bit. On the other hand, Yagi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" of a bridge being washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Yatsuri Town Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryuichi: "We have determined it as 'Yatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards. We have also made an announcement about it.
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course of the Paralympic Games.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of sightseeing in Tokyo through digital means.
In the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and the people who visited the venue put on the dedicated equipment and ran on the reproduced Paralympic marathon course in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, their own avatar appears and they can experience a competition running a marathon course with participants from inside and outside the country. Furthermore, they can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
"Running while seeing the scenery of Tokyo like this is tough, but it's really fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure that people can enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The new "Building Condition Survey" system established to revitalize the used housing market is doing well in used housing transactions.
Both the prices of detached houses and condominiums have been increasing, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of staying at home has been increasing due to the corona disaster, demand has been concentrated on properties represented by words such as "in front of the station", "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale", and "tower", and the number of newly built properties at relatively low prices has decreased, which may be due to the influence of this.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a survey called "inspection" for the purpose of secure and safe transactions of used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate Transaction Business Law (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including the deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, giving the buyer a sense of security.
It also contributes to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer side, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase, and they can purchase with satisfaction, and it is a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party with the authority to conduct a building condition survey is mainly the seller.
In addition, it is important to note that only the announcement of the inspection system was made mandatory.
In other words, the real estate business in charge of the mediation has the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking abroad, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom. There is a risk of concern with the seller-led inspection.
Before the sale of a house, the buyer can request a building inspection from a specialist called an inspector or building surveyor.
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, 70-90% of the transactions for existing homes are inspected.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the "seller" main inspection.
The seller's side will try to show the condition of the building as good as possible, sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey content and thinking that they want to live with peace of mind by making appropriate repairs.
Even though it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy in the objectives and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection survey based on the seller-led type prescribed by the country is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking important defects ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned project can also be called a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted with "consideration" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

It was quite hard.
However, I had mentally recovered, so I was full of motivation.
Because I was a researcher and my body wasn't keeping up, I would sometimes fall asleep while working.
Since it was the second time in a year, I thought about taking a break for a month and parting ways with the crappy company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it dragged on for a long time.
In any case, it is important to go to a psychiatry and get proper treatment, as well as to keep a record of your visits.
If you have a medical history, even if you resign for personal reasons, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the judgment of a doctor at the Hello Work, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance and so on will be drastically lowered.

Five pieces of trivia you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula in the past.
As evidence of that ... ..., it is only in Ginza that you can show off a bit of trivia.
Let me introduce you to some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to share with someone after you learn it.
Go up Ginza!?
First infiltration into the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can find traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines scattered around.
While walking around Ginza with her, the sudden silence was broken with "You know, this used to be a peninsula back in the day.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The epitome of a bustling shopping district that has given birth to "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, "Ginza" in Tokyo's Chuo Ward.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint where silver coins were made, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year) the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was moved to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawachō", but when it moved to Ginza it became known by the nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
From before the Edo period, a peninsula called "Edomae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza, with a bay entering from Hibiya to Marunouchi.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
And they cut down the soil and Kanda-yama that had been dug out, and filled in the inlet.
Why not try looking for the stone monument of "Ginza's Place of Origin" which indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Ginza Tiffany Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) if you are interested?
A pilgrimage to the Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibyōjin Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabukiza Theatre.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who come to worship before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryukou Fudou Son" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Deseche Jizou Son" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi Ginza Terrace.
The "Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" are located in the back alleys and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" is known for being respected by Ichimura Uzaemon, a Kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" where the fox welcomes you is built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, so that the benefits of the "Five Grains Abundance" where the rice is well harvested can be obtained.
This eventually led to the benefit of business prosperity being said to be in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, and even in Japan's most bustling street, Ginza, faith began to spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve has been cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to get rid of the pain quickly.
Before the treatment, when I touch my teeth, I get a sharp pain, will it get better in a few days...?
The painkiller doesn't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.
Take care.

Recruiting Script Compilation Method & Existing MOD Script Modification Method
I tried really hard to look at various things, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that purpose because I want to start from MO2 (I don't want to run the script source or Resources), but I don't know how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorial, but there's only information on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...

During the Greater East Asia War, were most of the military personnel civil servants of the state?
Almost all of them are not, but all of them are now called civil servants.
Since the military itself is an organization of the state, those who are said to be conscripted are considered to be government officials in terms of organization.

A male body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shounai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoinagawa River in Moriyama-ku and reported it to the 110th.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he had died at the scene.
The police are quickly verifying the identity and investigating the cause of death.
Meanwhile, in the Sunagawa in Okazaki-shi, Fukuoka-machi, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river and his death was confirmed.
Although there was no disorder in the men's clothing, it is said that there was a bicycle fallen nearby.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity and investigate the situation at the time.
Regarding the payment of the non-taxable household allowance in the middle of February, if there is one non-taxable person in the household, will it be paid?
It looks like the confirmation documents will be sent out from today...

Korean Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, POSCO International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the procedures such as the approval at the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the approval of the local corporation still remaining, the acquisition procedures are scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition will be the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, and it was decided that Posco International would invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy would invest 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the energy transition era, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the market with green hydrogen, leading to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Originally, February 11 was the only national holiday, but now it is a holiday because the current emperor was born in February on the 23rd.

Could the pain in your knee be "osteoarthritis" ?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: I have been having knee pain recently.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial Department: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to soften impacts and make joint movement smoother.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in joints other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the base, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the foot, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial: So, what kind of structure does a joint have?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and depressions.
And the part where these two bones face each other is covered with articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editorial Department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Within the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the knee movement smoother, which is why.
Editorial Department: What symptoms occur when you have osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion role, isn't it?
However, if this wears away or becomes distorted, it can cause deformity of the joint and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basically pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the wash I wear something like a tracksuit to sleep in!
Even for heavy smokers, are there people who can quit smoking and people who can't quit?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he just felt like stopping and ended up actually stopping.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series that You Can Experience for Real (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Gambling Manga Series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where lives are at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my feet tingle ... ... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a planning video.
■Swamp The pachinko machine "Swamp" featured in the gambling abstinence record Kaiji is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaiji was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was equipped with large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono" and "3-Step Cruun", and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of means and finally resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to cause the ground to sink and tilt, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen for one ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The Iron Crossing that was imposed on debtors, including Kaiji, as a pastime at the "Star Side Party" hosted by the wealthy was an Iron Crossing of "Human Horse Racing".
The debtor advances, taking care not to fall off the thin iron frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win a prize, but there are only four steel beams, and the safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this iron girder crossing is highly dangerous, in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is possible to experience something very similar at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
This Eagle Bridge is a single iron bridge extending to a point 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building) high, and beyond it are prepared the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge", which you can reach on foot.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Core Ara Kojiro released a video on his YouTube of himself walking on the Eagle Bridge, saying "Iron girder crossing can be experienced in Japan", and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Divide into Emperor's side and Slave's side and play with a total of 10 cards, 1 Emperor's card and 8 Citizen's cards and 1 Slave's card.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have to shave off his own ears.
After a long and difficult battle, Kaiji realized that his ears, like the attached earphones, were being read by a device that sensed changes in pulse and body temperature and sent them, so he shaved his ears to the extreme and made his body abnormal to confuse Rindō-gawa and won.
The E-Card is commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon, etc.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing against actor Ryūya Fujii, who played Kaiji in the movie, using E-cards, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the new year, the Yamagata Shimbun gently pushes forward with an Inari Great Picture Horse at the prefectural shrine.
The large votive horse of the zodiac sign "Tora" (Boar) for the coming year appeared at the Kenkokushinjya Shrine (Yamagata City) as preparations for the New Year continue.
On the 11th, design students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to create the original drawings for the ema since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese Painting Course in the Fine Arts Department, which is led by Professor Sueeaki Matsunaga, Yuichi Tsuchiya (22) was selected for adoption.
The great picture horse is 3.3 meters wide and the center height is about 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya said he painted an image of the cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping in place, the figure of the tiger looking at the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, they may have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature".
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the ema generally distributed.
Gonnegi Kenichi (44) from Chiba said, "I think I can be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

"Let's think about Tamano, where we want to continue living" - Proposal from a 4-high school student workshop: San Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the raw voices of young people will be compiled and proposed to the mayor.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison, such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns with a sense of purpose" while moving around "islands" with predetermined themes using the "World Cafe" method.
Write each idea on a sticky note and organize them by sticking them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting that there are many young people in this town." "Public transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
Are there any common points? Let's discuss further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is attractive," said Tamano Shokko High School third-year student (18).
Binnan High School third-year students (18) talked with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have a lot of nature," and they seemed to have noticed not only the regional issues but also the charm.
The second meeting in December will be attended by high school students only, to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the superintendent of education and make an announcement in February next year.
The president of the same center said, "In addition to fostering a sense of attachment to one's hometown among high school students, it could be a trigger for young people to take an active role in town development."
In Kanto, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake with a seismic intensity of 4 was recorded in the southern part of Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News
At around 12:31 PM on the 12th, an earthquake of magnitude 4 occurred in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures.
According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, with a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude (M) of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0.
There is no concern about the tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake is as follows in each area.
Shindo 4 = Kuki, Kasama Ishii (Ibaraki), Ashikaga Taisho, Tochigi Nishi-kata (Tochigi), Kiryu Motoyu, Ota Nishi-machi (Gunma), Saitama Iwatsuki-ku, Kazo (Saitama), etc. ▽ Shindo 3 = Mito (Ibaraki), Utsunomiya (Tochigi), Maebashi Horikoshi (Gunma), Kawagoe Shinjuku (Saitama), Chiba Hanamigawa (Chiba), Otemachi (Tokyo), Tsurumi Suehiro (Kanagawa), etc. ▽ Shindo 2 = Koriyama Konan (Fukushima), Hitachi (Ibaraki), Kanuma (Tochigi), Takasaki (Gunma), etc.

Finding a New Way to Wind a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding it, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices saying that they don't quite understand the trick.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be easily wrapped around, but then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves has a long side of approximately one meter, giving it a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it I thought, "Can it really be wrapped up this short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if weaving a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is in a net pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edges of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, it can be wound and secured without joining the ends together.
It's very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people will combine them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
Get Buck is a Peter Jackson directed one.
It feels like the Beatles in their full size, fresh in various ways...
We're on the brink of disbandment, so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying hard to keep the group together, there were Pauls who were annoying with lines like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!", George who would hesitate and say "But...", John who was always late and didn't seem motivated, and Ringo who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a troubled expression...
We didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very familiar atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles had the same feeling. What is it called, a legendary dismantling?
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
It's amazing how a simple phrase can turn into an iconic song as we go back and forth asking "how about this?"
Especially the moment when the title track Get Buck is finished is amazing.
A subtle hum-hum-hum like a nose song gradually turned into a Zucha♪ Zucha♪ and the scene where the lyrics came in was recorded properly, it's amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, it doesn't happen very often.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is sweating it out, so just by watching the performance scene you can be happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three has been released so far, but my impression is that the main cause of the Beatles' breakup was more the environment around them than the Beatles themselves.
Despite all the complaints, when they started making music, they seemed to be having fun, but when it came to the topic of where to have their live performance, the producer and the people in charge of promotion started talking in a Beatles-like manner, and it was easy to see that the members had no say in the matter.
Well, since a documentary involves the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe it's because Paul is supervising, so there are a lot of scenes where Paul looks like a villain.

How strong is Berserk's Guts compared to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't do it
Don't call out the move name before performing the move.
I thought that since you have a serious personality, you feel a sense of responsibility and your heart has become strained without any room for leisure.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to change jobs. I'm not good at sales activities that I initiate myself, but I thought I was really suited for sales activities that customers need, so I changed jobs to a different industry and it was much easier to work.
Even though I was asked about what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, my life will be a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest before considering this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there is a union of the company, an industrial doctor or a consultation window, it may be better to consult there, as there may be some system.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have occurred frequently in the United States causing great damage, due to the unseasonably warm weather and strong cold weather influences (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday 10th local time to Saturday 11th, tornadoes have been occurring frequently in the southern United States.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this time of year caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, resulting in the rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest to the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on both Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air flowing southward below -30°C near 5500m in the upper atmosphere, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, which was a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday alone, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (modified Fujita Scale) reached, which is the third strongest out of the six levels, with gusts of wind up to 70 m/s.
There is also a possibility that it will be classified as EF4-5 with future surveys.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita scale) is used, based on the Fujita scale, adapted to the condition of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, has a sufficient possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

Voices calling for help from under the "historic largest" rice-dragon roll were broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, on the 11th (Japan time 12th), President Biden expressed his opinion with a solemn expression, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
Reported by US CNN TV and others.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
In Kentucky, which was affected by the tornado, residents carry household goods and furniture from the broken house. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As for the range of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that caused damage to Missouri and other states in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the maximum scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Meadfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory which was operating 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas season also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
Trapped under a thick pile of rubble about 1.5 meters in the dark, the woman felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the broadcasted live stream, it is believed that the song "Happy Birthday To You" was heard, with another woman crying and singing in an attempt to disguise her fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store employee living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and they were safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumble from the ground," he reflected.
The police officers of the Mayfield City Police will continue the search activities until they are no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue efforts without knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, a warehouse of the major online retailer Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the impact of being separated from the carriages, and the highway is also being blocked consecutively due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to increase it?
Take high-protein foods and drinks.
Avoid coarsely chopped raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

It's tough to get on welfare...
I'm praying that something can be done
It would be nice if there were "live-in work" options like ryokan and resort jobs that would provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there aren't many options given the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.
I looked it up and it seems like there is this site ↓,
Live-in part-time job / full-time job - Live-in recruitment Navi (SumiNavi)
There are "bargain, live-in, job" in the related search, so it seems that there are many colleagues like that.
For bank accounts and line contracts, it seems that it can be done somehow if there is an address only for the first time, but for credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't update it without an address (because a new card is sent to the registered address).
What does a specialist in gynecology mean as a doctor?
A "senior specialist" is a doctor in the 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Late-Term Trainee Doctor".
The so-called "resident doctor" refers to a "first-year resident doctor", which is a doctor in the first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, when it comes to four to five years, I am able to do a certain level of medical care, so I am entrusted with various tasks.

It is an old saying that there are different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries use a five-star system as a basis for subtracting points, the claim is that Japan uses a three-star system as a neutral point for adding or subtracting points.
At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings, "there are demerit elements" and "it is not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we set the standard at five stars, then both "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level" are on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a system defect not to present the meaning of stars, but since it is actually operated in such a system, I understand why you want three stars (bad reviews) not to be given.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and can fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity that can be taken from the USB is up to about 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump varies depending on the model, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.
The numbers are vastly different.

The Making of a Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio sound, but I heard a different radio than the frequency I tuned into.
The tuning may have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right..
So, getting to the point, I was supposed to make an AM radio but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
Why do you think so? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the Esp of SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a loose file in the appropriate location, then it doesn't need an ESP.
I remember seeing a story somewhere about that, but I can't remember where I saw it...
I understand the risks so I don't plan to actually do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If there is someone who remembers, please tell me if it is okay to do.
Thank you for your submission.

<Saga Eating Record> "Hakobune" "Freshly-caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living・Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento "Freshly caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce".
"Hakobune," a takeout specialty shop with a colorful and abundant bento box and deli (souzai).
Koyuki Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple opened last August to give people the feeling of a restaurant even at home.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fried with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available at the market at the time.
According to Mr. Kiyoshi, the texture of the fried food can be directly understood because the flour is thinly coated so that the texture of the ingredients can be understood.
The bento box includes four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Saga Prefecture-grown Hinohikari rice with mixed grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are sourced from the self-grown field next to the house, or from direct sales shops in the prefecture.
The side dish varies depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has trained in French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that provides a "familiar and comfortable taste" (Yumi-san) that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, like rolled omelette.
The bento "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to come across something interesting at Haneda Airport, so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not to the point of getting dizzy).
Naturally slow in speed
I think it was safe because the speed was reduced when there were people around and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The stares of the people around me hurt. It's good to be seen, but it feels like they're saying "you're in the way," and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people and if there were more considerations such as having them move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with people walking around.
I thought it was a great vehicle because you could take your time and enjoy the scenery while relaxing a bit, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a vehicle that was difficult to ride unless you had a strong heart, with a sense of anticipation due to the near future feeling of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pleasantness of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you might understand a little bit, but this is an eel bowl with no eel used at all.
The answer is "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the answer)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone just eats it with sauce and that anything other than the grilling would be fine. But then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I didn't want the eel to go extinct, but I just felt like eating eel.
Recipe Used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (Substituted Sansho pepper for the scallion.)
I just fried the steamed one in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.

The work isn't going well.
Around October, I was considering taking a break, and with my half-hearted sense of responsibility, I finally reached my limit.
I'm quitting my job and I'm thinking of giving up on IT.
But I don't know how to live from now on.

One man was cut off and escaped on a motorcycle on the 12th in Saga City, Otsu, attempted murder incident | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, on the street of Daizai 1-chōme in Saga City, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s, and suffered injuries to his face.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities on the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong enterprise Find Asia corporate consultant) China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the number of mammal species being the highest in the world and the number of plant species being the third highest in the world.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection by local governments but also the activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan Province, located in southwest China, is also one of such regions.
Ms. Li Wanda, my younger sister, is currently active as an actress. Si Sa Phan Na is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group, which shares its roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The autonomous state of Xishuangbanna Dai (Xishuangbanna Dai) occupies only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Ms. Li Minhua at the scene in Xisha Islands and heard about her environmental protection activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Lee, we started our environmental protection activities "Tianzhu" in 2000.
The trigger was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seychelles for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and it was proud of its numerous biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to root industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests was carried out in the past.
He was dispatched from Germany to here for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here I met a journalist I knew and got married.
Before that, did Mr. Lee not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li, I am from Cispanana, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I had to push the project forward with my husband without any knowledge.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or a particularly tall stature, I sometimes see people with an aura. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out when you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of self-confidence inside.

I suddenly thought, is it too detailed to comment on someone's outfit or say something like "that color looks nice"?
It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I haven't been told to praise in detail, so I'm not sure what it means.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yokomine Sakura?
"My heart is blooming with joy after your confession, I would be honored to go out with you," I replied and we began our relationship.
And, in order to date, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at a later time?
Opening them at the same time will make the procedure faster to complete.
It will be completed in about a week.
We recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to, as there are no fees involved.

【Omakan / Personal Note】It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of CTD in the MOD self-environment.
Due to lack of time to play around the GW period and the multiple causes of CTD since March, it took a long time to identify it, mainly during holidays and with little by little investigation.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have been known in a few minutes)? Some errors related to the .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
Main timing of CTD
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins that log.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activation with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement * Is there a possibility of wet clothes for this?
For some NPCs, camera work when activating kill moves is improved by setting kill moves to OFF via .ini for PCs. Is there a conflict in settings related to DAR+Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 for DAR animations.
(Basic outdoors) During field movement + partial magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID NPC application settings (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could this be caused by additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Note that the SPID usage default.ini in 2.0 has a formatting mistake, but as a result, the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
Initially, we focused heavily on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MOD (.dll) and the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there were any people who have the same CTD problem in a Japanese language environment, I thought it might be useful as a reference and allowed myself to post it.
Everyone is doing it with a barely mental state.
Nobody around me notices it, not even my colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person looks like they're having a hard time, but they're working hard and staying energetic."
He is probably on the brink of a mental breakdown.
Although I haven't officially retired in name of mental health, I think I was at my limit right before I retired.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits - After today's visit nursing is finished
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have built a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also do the necessary things for medication management (such as one-packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply moved by the importance of enjoyable communication for people with mental illness during today's home visit nursing.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and we even laughed about it.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, or why she got divorced, and so on - is that okay in home nursing?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations operated by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or when an occupational therapist comes to the visiting nursing station, they are given orders in a condescending manner, such as "This is a medical facility, after all".
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses are really good because they face me on an equal footing and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits, and there may be people who are considering receiving them.
Visiting nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had cases where I couldn't agree and had to cancel the contract from my side.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was still startled when it came up in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what it will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.
Language detection malfunction

Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One Fifth of China's... "Delayed in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
The content was to spread 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, by November this year, fuel cell vehicles will not exceed the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (approximately 117 locations) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilo is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's performance of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap was far below the target value.
The Japan Association of National Economy (Zenkeiren) released a report on "Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem Status and Policy Directions" on the 12th.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The carbon fiber, which is the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Industry Organizations conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that the competitive countries are at the lower end."
The country-specific patent ranking is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since China overtook the United States to become number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of China (4721).
The Zenkyoren proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large tax deduction for equipment investment and research and development expenses."

We recommend the set menu at 290 yen (excluding tax), 490 yen (excluding tax), and 790 yen (excluding tax).
Except for cash on delivery, I think it would be tough if there's no address.
And I feel like daily payments will be difficult if there is no contact information (phone number).
Furthermore, an address is required for the line contract.
So don't forget to keep your smartphone line contract...
For the time being, even if we manage to get by with manga cafes and day labor
Securing an address is the top priority, so don't forget.
It is important to sleep on a futon, and simply to open a bank account or use a debit card or receive government services, an address is necessary.
Although it should be possible to receive welfare benefits without an address, it's probably a rare case.

It is legal.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the original price.

The Town Council of Taka-su is undertaking unique council reforms, such as creating an eye-catching flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate their council members.
The town council election is a consecutive three-term no-vote, with the aim of getting the townspeople to take an interest.
To inform about the Sunday Council to be held on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Live Giron from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Sawaguchi Hito Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th had wording that evoked popular television program names.

US Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engage in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) US State Department officials reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12th.
The military assistance is equivalent to a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, etc., will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the reinforcement of Russian forces around the Ukrainian border.
The US is strengthening its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, and is also discussing with the NATO member countries and developing countermeasures in case Russia launches an attack on Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House in September this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine by force, the total amount of aid has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, in accordance with a multilateral joint training program to support Ukraine, state troops from the US state of Florida were dispatched.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a secret matter for the purpose of carrying out operations.
President Biden held an online meeting with President Putin of Russia on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hands" for pre-mortem gifts, directly attacking Masaru Amano, former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the end of the year and New Year!"
Pre-mortem gift and rush succession technique.
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, the outline of the tax system reform for the 2022 fiscal year, which was a concern, was not included, but there is a high possibility that pre-death gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become "forbidden hands" in the near future.
How will the rules of succession change?
Along with a direct hit to former LDP Tax Commission Chairman, Akimi Amari, Member of the House of Representatives, I will impart everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques in order to make it in time for the end of the year with a beneficial rush gift.
(Diamond Editing Department, Kei Miyahara)
From asset holders to urban company employees, "forbidden hands" are used for pre-death gifts, and "from the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer"
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because the implication of what is being said is to change the rules of succession and to increase inheritance taxes by making "gifts before death" a forbidden act, which is the mainstream inheritance tax countermeasure.
The iron rule for tax reduction measures for inheritance tax with a high degree of progressivity is "reducing the assets subject to taxation".
The pre-mortem gift, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees in the three major metropolitan areas who have a small amount of inheritance tax generated from their homes.
In the midst of this, the discussion of "Integration of Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax" emerged.
Although it was not included in the Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, "Review the current inheritance tax settlement taxation system and calendar year gift system", "The non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted) ... "etc., a policy towards integration was once again proposed with more in-depth wording.
Former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party and former Chairman of the Tax System Research Council, Kanemaru, said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of asset transfer and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration. If the amendment is made at the fastest speed, there are only three chances left for pre-mortem gifts.
Even without that, it seems certain that in the near future, a large step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how do the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】The heroine, Kanon Yamaya, stars in this heart-wrenchingly pure love story, based on the manga of the same name by Morie Satoshi, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018. It follows a man and woman carrying the burden of the past.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Rise, is played by Yamayagi Kanjū.
Riso, a university student, meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kaori, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is attracted to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents by divorce, but is Kairi a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yuudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
Those who were unable to watch FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already watched it should be able to gain a deeper understanding of the work by seeing the complex psychological depiction of Karie and Riseto, as well as their conflicting and changing relationship.
I'm happy if even the fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

After the team won with only three passes in the NFL game, what did the players feel and how did they feel it (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had exceeded 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in history.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with their run game of Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The main reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s, and before the game it was snowing.
Since the Bulls were from the local area, they didn't change their play selection much.
Passes 30 times versus runs 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not bad.
There were four red zone penetrations in the 10 offensive series and scoring opportunities.
In particular, from the end of the third quarter onwards, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to score 3 points in one FG in those three times.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bulls, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty at 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
Then he threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stephon Diggs was running a slant route and was open in front of the endzone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th & 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant and ended in failure.
Bryant was covering Bill's WR Call Beadley man-to-man, but midway he saw Allen's movement and released Beadley, reacting to the pass.
Allen, who had overlooked two receivers, threw two passes aiming for the end zone.
The 4th down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on the 3rd down.
You should get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if he had made it to 4th and short, Allen's ability to make his own run should have come to life.

It's time to replace the three items that have been in your kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it is probably not recommended to change the sponge as often as you would.
Research from 2017 has shown that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (although it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when the cutting board begins to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria multiply.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or lightly pat with a clean paper towel to cut off the water and dry.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked
It may be painful to dispose of your favorite mug, but the broken surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of chapped lips and spilled drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged Righteous General Guan Yu, Submitted by Builder Yu Jin
Submerged General Guan Yu "Oi, Yujin!"
No smoking.
"Yukin won't die even if 30,000 arrows come raining down on him."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die, right?"
"Ussu"
"You won't die even if you get swallowed up by the muddy stream of the Han River."
"Ussu"
"So can we hold out for three quarters of an hour in the underwater bridge attack?"
"Ussu Ussu"
"Now, practice so you can endure until the next battle of Sekigahara!"
"Ussu!"
Is it a promise?
"Got it!"
"Someday you might be killed by Cao Cao and I wouldn't even know!"
Saying that, the righteous general returned.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water attack, water bridge three quarters practice! We absolutely can't do it without putting handcuffs and shackles on and locking them in a cage and sinking them.
Did you read the article at the link I quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community market and trade are two different things.
At the community market, we use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been victims of scams where they are left with only the item and no money paid.
That won't happen
Trade is a function that allows items to be exchanged or presented as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different topic?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even for simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even for intellectual labor.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that kept blinking without stopping.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be an old USB memory or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you overslept and become drowsy?
Is there any other similar cause?
Do you dislike men who always have a straight face?
Oh! I saw an acquaintance.
He always had a bag-a-bond face.
I wasn't particularly disliked.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
If it's something inconspicuous, I can carry it, but I can't carry something like Louis Vuitton with a monogram with "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one you call by my last name/talk to in a rude way?"
If they say that it doesn't matter because they are a foreigner, it's best to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I'm dreaming of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly good probability.
I was living overseas halfway, but the Japanese who went out, including me, hated the Confucian etiquette from top to bottom, and there were quite a few people who came, and I felt like the tag was off, and I misunderstood that I could say anything to the locals.
If it looks like an European or American, I don't think there's any malicious intent, it's more like a kind of spoiled behavior or a friendly attitude.
Even though my friend is from Europe or the Americas, I usually call them by their first name, but when speaking in Japanese, I sometimes hesitate for a moment about which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's a friend.
It's probably just doing things normally and purely at the beginning, but if you overlook it, it may be impossible to stop the exceptional treatment of being called a gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Can you talk to me according to the rules of Japan because it is Japan?
Study: My white friend who naturalized has a habit of always raising his glass higher than the others at drinking parties, even though it's unrelated.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but if I do it like that, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
No matter what kind of personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details, so it's annoying.

Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created sub had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm really happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to get to 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
For those of you who subscribed to this sub-reddit today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let us know in the comments section where you found out about this sub-reddit! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Currently, there is only one person making threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could make threads as well.
Even if you don't start a thread, it will be encouraging if you comment.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those who use Reddit.
People who use Twitter, please be sure to start a thread!
Finally, thank you very much! The sub-rule I made before didn't gather people as I thought, and I gave up soon, but this time I seem to be able to continue without giving up thanks to everyone.

Since I only have the ability to understand a little English, I will only judge based on the translated text.
The translated text may feel a bit off in terms of its wording, but I can understand the message it is trying to convey and I think it is at a level where it won't be a hindrance to playing (I'm only saying this from my own perspective, so it might be best to ask others as well).
You often see translations of this level in games made overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like it's usually well translated.
I think for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it may take a long time of studying to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

Consideration: Training is the battle in "Demon Slayer".
"Equal Exchange of Effort" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Start Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the abundance of training.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles day or night and only training, is not popular with readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that only the touching parts were drawn and the rest was skipped over grandly, that there was a two-year training period when the Straw Hat Pirates separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE".
Well, one-piece is one of the attractions of the wandering land, but there are times when "staying in the same place and practicing" is not compatible.
So, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled before the life-saving Togata Giyu and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, and was told by Giyu, "Don't let anyone else hold the power of life and death!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they are all forced to submit to the powerful by force... ...
While saying that, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness (though he was also a bad communicator who didn't explain his intentions) to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps.
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate people?" Tanjiro was at a loss for words, to which Rengoku replied with a single shot, "You're slow to judge."
Among the fans, it's an unreasonable exchange that looks like a rumor.
Taking my sister, who has become a demon, for a walk, there is a possibility that I may be forced to make such a judgment at any moment.
I suppose it can be called an initiation to enter the training from the mental attitude.
Rin Takadaki tells Tanjiro to take him to the Mt. Hagiri, even though he is an amateur who has not yet trained, and to make it down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls such as pits, catapults, and traps, and it seems like you will die before you even start your training.
Still, with his sharp sense of smell, he can detect the faint scent of a trap set by a person, and somehow manages to avoid it, which is what is called the "protagonist correction".
Nonetheless, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba that allows Tanjiro to say "But I can't suddenly become more physically capable to avoid all of that!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become strong without any proof, and awakening is only being able to use the "power and techniques polished up until then" with its original potential.
"The equivalent exchange of effort" is a human anthem that is different from a demon with the power of an unfounded supernatural force, and it is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work; those who make an effort will be rewarded accordingly, and those who do not make an effort will not be rewarded at all.
Is this old?
Sleeping without a bed, directly on the floor with a futon, a quilt, and a comforter is a way of sleeping.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will it be difficult?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle between different stores?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such cases, it doesn't fit with my "stubborn" thinking.
I think of it as "gumption" to devise a plan to get more benefit than effort with the least effort possible.

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Department" integrating home appliances and mobile, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into a single Set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name the new division DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division is composed of business units such as VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Network, which have been integrated from the CE and IM divisions.
Samsung Electronics personnel explained that the name change this time reflects the mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, it was also emphasized that the products, such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs, should enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience with ease.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to build a foundation for differentiated products and services that create synergies on a company-wide scale and transcend organizational boundaries.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through the interconnection of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500BCE mean before the Common Era?
What would it be like to say it in Japanese?
It was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for non-Christians, it has become more common to write BCE in recent years based on the idea that it should be thought of.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

Although there are matters of preference, I don't think that the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator who has a low voice.
I would like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait with their mouths open, only their armored heads visible above the sand... anything that falls into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch their prey, exposing only their disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand, ready to capture prey, with only their circular heads protruding from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Seeing it from an ant's perspective?
I wonder.
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular head" would make the part "a giant monster wearing an armor" disappear, right...?
24 vehicles collided in Aichi, the trailer driver had no pre-existing illness, was it carelessness? (Television Asahi Network (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
It has been found that the driver of the trailer, who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in which 24 cars collided, had no chronic illness and that the accident was likely caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people suffered minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the initial collision accident and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to be prosecuted on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, Nomura suspect had no illness and it was found that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises and investigating the situation in detail.

"Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News"
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from volume 3, will be concluded in this fourth volume!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted everything from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to the focus being narrowed down to only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
In one word, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first of all, it should be noted that it is not a volume that only depicts the matches on the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes that are quite different from before, but that doesn't mean it's boring at all.
As the tension of the century-long war gradually intensifies in the story, this feeling is certainly connected to the reader's increasing tension, and it is truly amazing that even this period has been calculated as a production.
And before the important final, there is one more mountain that cannot be missed, the 3rd place deciding match between Teri-man and Ramen-man.
In addition to the luxuriousness as a battle card, what I like is the scene behind the scenes before the match, where Ramen Man is pointing to the poster of Kinnikuman and saying "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!"
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, received the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with a silent stare and the two parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a heated debate about Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply!
The fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was the appeal of Ramenman's tears after the match.
"Do not underestimate the strength of God's luck towards Kinnikuman!"
It's a line of dialogue.
This is what I would call a grand meta-statement about the work itself. I think readers have always had a feeling that Kinnikuman will ultimately win because he is the protagonist, and he has been winning in some way, even if it's not through strength.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei had already stabbed the dagger, saying that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one phrase, the reader wonders, "Wait, does Kinnikuman defeat Robin with his own strength?"
How?
It will also stimulate imagination for the unpredictable development ahead, and from another perspective of the writer, this is like a line of dialogue that the teacher who makes the work has imposed on himself.
Wow, you did an amazing thing!
I definitely think this volume's big point is one of them.

Winter Illumination Weekend held in Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba Mountain Herb Village in Takahama-chō Nakayama, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "I was surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find a place like this."
She said it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healed while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, the 25th, a Christmas event is planned with activities such as button pot and movie screenings.

The Yamagata Shimbun reports on the Yonezawa Agricultural Promotion Association's online delivery of agricultural and livestock products PR from Yonezawa.
On the 11th, the Okishima Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities and towns in the Okishima region and JA, etc., launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce", which distributes videos on the Internet while selling products.
The Tokyo Minato Market TV, which was the first project planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, featured the Yamagata Aisen Bujotai remotely, delivering the appeal of the region along with its special products.
The "Okitama x Minato Opening Port Project", a collaboration between the Oki-tama area and the Minato Ward, was decided to set up a store through the connection, and was broadcast from Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Harunomachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier", wears a "Nitorto (Nitorto)" brand from Yonezawa Weaving and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I immediately shut it down.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not starting up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp will light up for a moment and the fan will start to move but will soon stop.
After that, he said nothing.
Even if I unplug the power plug and try again, it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pin and removing all other parts, the computer still does not start up.
5.) Since there had been a sound like "bubbubububu" as if something was hitting the PSU, I suspect that it might be the cause.
I'll try to find and test an ATX power supply that's left over from another day.
Maybe.
What should I do if it doesn't work?
Change the case and the mother together...?

The crying-laughing type emoji for 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are really easy to use, aren't they?
Of course, when it's fun and happy, I did it!
Even in times when nothing can be done, and when one feels helpless, wouldn't there be few people who use it in a self-deprecating way?
On the contrary, people who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are very rare.
I want you to keep that style.

I haven't used it, but it seems like Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.

Large-sized garbage (fee-based), additional note> Collection box of the local government (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it second-hand.
Update > Mercari, Hard Off
Do people also sell things at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It may be a wise choice to sell while it's still worth money.

The broken printer that no one will take, the old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky trash, probably no money will be spent, but it's being put off for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated abroad have no value...
In Japan, bills can be exchanged but coins cannot be exchanged.
As commemorative coins contain gold, they have value.
Even if they haven't done anything wrong, there are still people you don't like, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes since we are human.
"Hate something for no reason," that's what it's like to hate someone.

She can't do it, is she being discriminated against by her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that you can be judged by your looks.
It can't be seen on the surface.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduating?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, we were roommates, haha.
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
All lust and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.
Men's Volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's Fencing, Freer finishes in 4th place without a medal.
Dragon God Japan, 8th place after 29 years! The men's volleyball Japanese representative advances to the final T. Coach Nakagaki: "It was a big goal."
I thought it was over when I lost the third set in the referee challenge x2, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
It seems like the opponent until the semi-finals was in a different class, so why is that opponent in the 3rd place deciding match?
I would like to plant trees that serve as a blind in the garden, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As a hope, it is better to have evergreen trees that are easy to take care of and, if possible, bear fruit.
Thank you in advance.

How much savings do we need to live comfortably together without any difficulty?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of separation.
It is better to make a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation has no benefits.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-recorded legendary rare (^_^;)
Is there any game that uses cards like Ganbaraging as a hobby?
I think it's an ant.
