The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
It costs 179€ today.
Honestly, I find that very frustrating.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of getting a credit?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also beneficial for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just take a quick look, just help out for a bit, just bring the bottle, etc.
Through this, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it is okay for him, that is good.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he should change K2's diapers and stay with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is of course up to your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about anxiety and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken up by a female detective who, after a brief investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain to suppress an anxiety center and the patients ultimately have to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumped out of the window while another deliberately drove herself to her death.
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with a fire.
That is the general plot and I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is familiar to someone or even if someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That can take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
The child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outside).
We tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

What should I do with this number then?
Regarding Omikron, Johnson will push for a booster vaccination.
New cases of Omikron are causing concern for both politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, by New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - In light of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the deadline has been at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency with the Omikron variant, so it is essential to increase vaccination protection.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let yourselves be boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation came via email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Could someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How else can such a upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since about.
Not for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not seek help or think that we cannot help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my career that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series "League of Legends" worth?
Filled with fantasy, complex names, and an awe-inspiring presentation, "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg suffered a derby debacle against the Merlins Crailsheim in the Basketball Bundesliga.
At least Johannes Patrick the youngster could be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But that didn't settle after the game - it increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Wherein more than the bare result disappointed the manner of performance.
As an example, one statistic expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the win at Teneriffa, and we did not implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like performing in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least also due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While even the star players on Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
In the last quarter (22:15) the Giants prevented a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already contacted a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally contacted each other half a year ago.
Always perfectly dressed: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthrall his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and with enthusiasm as a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of popular songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was recognized with numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair combed back strictly and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hi #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and thus we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through it.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No new housing will be created through expropriation, only the ownership structure will change," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the results of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of tenancy law through talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hi, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will come again at all?
It has storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm).
Coupon sounds great
Then I redeem it independently with the new order
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
This is an absolute act of disrespect.
At least 100 deaths due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to pass through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, stores, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of display case #NAME#.
That's very sad.
Is it still in production?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I returned an item via the contact form and wanted to inquire if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the reworking of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get the Corona vaccine.
He changed to a company he had criticized.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old job and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That's where the rest of the story will develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero, luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, bargaining, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears will stop the wagon.
If it comes to battle and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all rendered unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
What do you think of Deus ex Machina as an appropriate solution to Option 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to return them.
Can you then have the returns slips come, then I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sports F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on German Sky has been decreasing, so I want to vent a bit with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the start delay and the start accident caused the schedule to be far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it is the case that, for legal reasons, Formula 1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on Formula 1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time that they are left guessing what is possible or required according to the rules, both of them simply have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like the artificial comment style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky; in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Both of these channels also make less advertising in their broadcasts than Sky, and that as free-TV channels.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts Formula 1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
So, anyway, this great F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'm interested in hearing your opinion.
One of these: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multi-Colored Glass
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I request assistance.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variations by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
For a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that multiple outflows can be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Fans pumps are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and set the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards, which would cause the water from the basin to flow through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a few precautions so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer.
It is so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in logistics...of course, here, no Corona can stop it.
Please don't rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to criticize these services, even though we say at the moment...they have it really tough.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order light legs here too?
Amazon founder Bezos is sending his astronaut daughter and a moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly appointed astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amidst applause from friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space exploration engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She had just flown along with them, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He said he would most like to go back into space again right away, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space exploration from Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was present, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain lit in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the light stone retains one light color for about one minute before it gently transitions to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light proves itself year-round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, their light looks especially good - only with a shortened duration of light is to be expected when the days are shorter.
Please pay attention in winter to make sure that no snow affects the solar module's function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.

Someone who has worked or studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind being in the lab (I already have my inorganic chemistry practical behind me).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I definitely wanted and would study until I got my PhD.
Currently, I'm having doubts, especially the career prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one often hears about great job opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, on the other hand one often hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I'm really curious to know:
What are you currently employed as?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/ what training did you receive?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you so much for your answers!
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm considering dropping out of college in 2022 and getting an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them.
Extra stress before holiday and weekend holidays
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why a post is only being added now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems there are also holidays and bridge days before holidays.
It was like this: Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
Last week, we had a long four-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of emails that had to be sent out before the weekend, orders here and orders there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like a lot of time and that can't be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
So what's the point of having holidays if we can't even enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from the top, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just take a trip to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking and crafting with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the festive days, she still has some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started now".
Nekton-Bio supports a smooth molt and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based animal feeds.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
DDR Handcrafted Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived World War II and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become the GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment potential of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed, resulting in an increased demand for locomotives for heavy freight train services, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 that were available in larger quantities were preferred for assembly.
Once it became clear that the processing rate of the E 94 could not be increased any further, the E 95 came into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate timetable in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As age increased, the complicated control of locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that switches got stuck during switching operations.
Then the stoker, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in the middle of 1969, the last one, the E 95 01, resigned from service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transportation Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was achieved.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Heritage Society have been working on restoring the locomotive to operational condition.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves reliable due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
Initially, Silesia was the main area of operation.
Handcrafted H0 model in original packaging, functioning well, optical work on the locomotive needs to be done by the buyer, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I received a bed from you.
However, there were issues with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, unfortunately these are produced with errors.
The center beam does not fit into the designated bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the reports, two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over the further investigations.
But it will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
On social media, there were false reports that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated in order to counter these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
Şahin continued, writing that his school friend and his family were not vaccinated.
He did not inquire into the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle circulating on the internet, Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"Legally, I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself right now," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization for the vaccination of the vaccine.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had caused a power outage at a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in several communities were affected when the power went out due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant disruption and inconvenience.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
He explained that the repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally put some of the lines back into operation.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Electricity is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7:15 pm on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work needed.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
Since 11:15 PM, those affected by the power outage have also had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were particularly in focus.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who are unable to take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or require medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
This is the #PRS_ORG# blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
This is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot assemble it and shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to return it, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really simpler!
Then let's do it this way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it too.
When I try to open it, I get the message, "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# ePub file.
Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components that won't be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the construction part
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the layers of paint will later create a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a picket fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the darkness could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
Models achieve an authentic look through decals or transfers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to decorative trim and badges on car models, decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
A plane cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have previously moistened).
While holding the decal onto the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check if the picture is properly placed before you completely slide it off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Wipe up any excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I left off reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Even for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at me in 3 separate packages.
Nonetheless, thank you very much!
Then I will shop elsewhere once the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is a "covered event"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing the private health insurance, they suddenly refuse.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and got the approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had two unsuccessful attempts, but we hadn't yet claimed them with the private health insurance.
We applied again for cost coverage from the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones with the private health insurance), we submitted the bills to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With pregnancy/childbirth, the remaining two attempts of the first acceptance are forfeited.
The second wish would be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the room here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire with childbirth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
All right.
We will not be ordering anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the chest of drawers arrives completely damaged at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clear and evident that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two loyal customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the malfunction occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and be able to make it available to the transportation company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
According to Wikipedia:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture produced with minimal or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What interests you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, declared the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the unity in the Union at the same time.
She apparently cannot prevail if a member state sets its mind to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempted Border Crossing Again
According to Poland's border security, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson for the agency on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, border security registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the regulations.
On the last lap, Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I'm checking it.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of SC Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Breisgau Sports Club and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up that day in red and white jerseys.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The partnership between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park, it was again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing happy fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just completely leave it alone.
Yeah wow then you're just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But if you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-error free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification ratings.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When optimal usage conditions are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Shopping for Christmas trees in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz community are selecting the trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them for that purpose.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas time a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have any debates here about which dish is better, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name from this.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Issues with Fiber Optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less it receives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were still similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely labor-intensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch bank accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax allowance and even quartered it for the day money.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
This applies not only to new contracts, but also to "individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered its exemption limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless, more than 100 banks have now implemented a limit of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 Euro: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were granted the right by the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
Nevertheless, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts still fly to both female and male fans alike.
Maybe it's because she just has bad luck with love - and is still searching for her true love.
And crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame bring happiness.
An Unworthy End to a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight brush with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport top class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 Formula 1 World Championship with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and made it to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte triumphs in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it, I would have to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian skier Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte wins at home - podium for Jamanka
For the women, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced with pusher Deborah Levi to a World Cup victory on Sunday, resulting in a German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig placed third.
It was super cool for me to get my first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am super happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit frustrated with the not quite flawless runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Last year, due to Covid-19, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it said it had expired, which frustrated me a lot.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is shipping starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I type on it does an extra field appear with the message.
It was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only one more day, only one more week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls, girls, and women!
I have some things that I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for some others...
I am 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is essentially my child.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, he got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs too and because I wanted to see and feel him; we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
On top of that, he is sick and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week) which is causing me a lot of distress with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has been having stomach pains, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we have to do homework too, which we obviously have to divide up.
But cooking for myself is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I'm halfway through my therapy and I'm managing.
Not great, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me); tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I should at least prepare a bit for the anatomy class.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So this is how my week goes: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But does it continue after that?
Only until the birthday celebration.
Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams otherwise.
I think this has something to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I'd find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the exact color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
Moreover, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed it.
What is your opinion on it?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to keep them separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope my question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well too.
That's been a long time, then I would advise against it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help with film search
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for youth.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to gain life for himself.
I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this means anything to you, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has been sleeping on her belly since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child is much more resilient than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it rise up from the abdomen?
Or does it face down directly into the mattress?
You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "loyal customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any response yet.
This is about my wardrobe that arrived two days ago (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the politics of this station are now below all standards.
Almost any format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big fundraising tour at the same time.
It has been said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno said, "We don't want to be a rolling billboard."
What is one now?
An average advertising channel trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit from the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling – My little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable exclusively as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mold or burn marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking it!
Afterwards, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On the first warmings, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
Make sure to follow the specified warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and in a way that is inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority of the country in which the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after the first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt even under their third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the power adapter plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# Chair.
But I don't know how high the seat area is....
Often on tour and still bringing a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20 liter capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever everyday items you need, they will stay well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design speaks for itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photographic equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
Additionally, the clasp and hook are magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior (more on that below) and store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
Additionally, you can pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Convenient, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for an email from your support.

The logistics company has announced contact to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.

If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture and didn't return it.
And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not anticipate and was not able to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer, searching for wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build enterprises.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneering colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a blockade!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunslingers.
Once all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the announcer turns to a new location, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated parenting and education debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other caregivers must never, ever, ever! seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation, as is sensible and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the removal of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing obligation can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Minister Conference already on Tuesday next. - afp
So I want to return the lamp.
How should I best proceed?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer shop through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping online through the #PRS_ORG# website is possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often in seeing images, and most rarely in perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however, u/Nitemarex had none by definition.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is also standard practice in the eCommerce sector in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The logistics company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the doorstep due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order since I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why haven't I been called?
I had posed a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an impresario.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theatre.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already give thanks for my life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins its first MLS Championship
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1:1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rolled Roast Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
For Christmas there was this and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I'm getting the taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other advice for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books, or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I can manage it.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But until today, the money has not come in to me.
Would you please check there.
Where to find Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas days as the Christmas tree and the presents.
Have you not gotten poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and distortion.
Earlier it was mentioned that the POWER LEVEL control can even provide a power reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The attached signal is processed with a speaker simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an excellent "acoustic" sound impression.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX port so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there then the possibility to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to return it then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending more than 1,000 euros on items I don't need is a bit too much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the federal state with the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only state, the value is above 1000.
As the only state, Thuringia had an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday with regards to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Furthermore, health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It is time for change.
###Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing can be determined: it is non-existent.
We have entered a winter stasis and extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
For the most part, this is likely to be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we are generally standing.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders must be changed/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for that.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is quite sad too, as #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# daybed, is it also available in an oversized size, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be collected in good time.
And I request that you take action now.
I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pick-up - you need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for assembly?
How long would I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And namely, that I long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I got the impression that she was becoming disgruntled, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduces animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too blunt?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan!
It is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot be there in person for the funeral, so there is nothing I can do to change that.
Could I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
Starting from February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
The Lahnstein Fire Department is prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state.
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue apparatus of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, mayor of Lahnstein.
The appliance wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be a continuous increase in activity: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel rivers, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the difficulties started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but nothing worked after I synchronized, removed, and re-downloaded the app.
I'm a bit frustrated because this whole process has already taken up a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Alright, that's settled then.
I would like to order 3 items from #PRS_ORG#'s collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the aforementioned values were determined in the Fenix Lab at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally, it should be said that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people in uniform and carrying weapons are naturally attractive to those on the right side of the conservative spectrum, but it is also clear that these people can have difficulty dealing with the reality they live in. Nowadays, there are many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I'm not talking about the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't know unless they told you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put their own at risk for you.
But even these marginalized groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to do them right, while they just want to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there. However, it is completely exaggerated in the media that these people are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-endangering plans, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is a good thing in my opinion that we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros in black, or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that were filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Raising a Well-Behaved Child?
Hi, I (w32) have been occupied with one thing for a while.
At work, I am very disciplined and organized (I'm independent, with very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my house clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then and again I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that someone could come over spontaneously.
My husband isn't any better (unfortunately), it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I have no motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and for example there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does parenting provide greater motivation or does it lead to sloppiness?
I look forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
With the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area ensure a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate hood).
The soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams.
Double cuffs with zippers at the wrists and ankles connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, camouflaged neopren outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and strength when tightening.
Long zipper at the neck with an elastane reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded flush with external and internal overlap.
Edges of the outer sleeves hemmed for increased durability.
Grooves cut into the inner cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious-avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, that means I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very hard for me to have casual conversations and I've been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
However, I do not know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The code review process is already causing problems for me (emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any career, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please!
When I downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, the message came up that your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the food in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own protein substances from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the renewal of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
For severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the start of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the new feathering is completely finished.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
A statement by a local government employee in contradiction to the ordinance.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree needs to be cut down.
Also a request for action was submitted to the local government.
An employee wrote to me that felling fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the ordinance.
However, the walnut tree is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected in the charter.
Can I trust the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket shipped to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on State Road 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press alert (2:03 PM), a car has come into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Oh, okay, I understand.
Good, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the REF as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me, so I looked for alternatives that could be more fun.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now on my third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
Before painting, I always decide to continue and at least finish the reference, after that I can always switch.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Even though it's vacation now, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had free time.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that further frustrate me.
Generally, it's fun and from an outside perspective, the refereeing is going well too, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place in a year and be unhappy again.
You can tell that everything is kind of chaotic, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has steadily evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date with the latest technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which natural resonances just pour out.
With the VOX "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly how you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers shone, but it wasn't enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your camera equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot-shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photography related items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days so far, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Previously, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in the past few days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava hotter than 1000 degrees has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas formed from cooled lava with a combined size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas were severely affected.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold secretly into the window of three women in one night, in order to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular German custom emerged of filling the boots of children, especially, with presents.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons, they are protesting against the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin tradition with Martin singing and Martin processions, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from boots at the door to luxury watches under the Christmas tree, from socks to the most sought-after items.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all countries with a Christian influence, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum luminosity duration 10 hours.
- The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: "Smart Stone" does not require any power supply or batteries as a solar lamp.
Place the "Glowstone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you decide the color: in addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Eventually, the shutdown will also be automated once the battery charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to keep ordering from you, but if the coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been improved significantly again.
A variable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation especially for bell-armature motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for the automatic calibration of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides enough power with up to 1.5A motor current even for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello lovely ladies!
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that behind, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
Surprisingly, my main problem is not the pain but my skin.
I had suddenly gotten an explosion of acne from 0 to 100 during my last two-year break and they were everywhere.
On the surface it seemed okay, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel good.
In the two year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any advice to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have to wait for my dermatologist appointment.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Previously had severe eczema, then a period of calm, then widespread lichen planus and the acne issue.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to chronic illness and have settled on a low sugar, low dairy, and low meat diet because nothing else seemed to work properly.
It may also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if I have problems everywhere like I do, I would rather not look for what else could be wrong.
I had already given everything to her colleague Semina or something.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone and then suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my banking information, maybe something was wrong.
But is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in large sizes in black

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments.
In the courtroom, they are seated on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them are talking to the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the total 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot log into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have any options for storing it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Yes, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely disassembled for pickup and return?
And when would the pickup be?
A 110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's approval of the plan makes way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about it, I already explained it multiple times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and they refuse to come into the apartment due to their regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because nobody is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is the same for all books, which is why the inquiry was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Lesson Planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been teaching since summer and I enjoy it, but I am currently having a lot of difficulty planning my geography lessons in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for other activities).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather unsatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore, the worksheets as well.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Retail is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are only allowed to be entered by those who are vaccinated or recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there have been declines in sales for stores selling non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers conducted by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the holiday shopping season.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It is only doing well in the grocery retail and e-commerce sectors.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The Chief Executive Officer said that shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe matter.
"Bringing 2G when shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel involvement.
He demanded that the band regulation must be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as is already the case with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) in public transport.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, with revenues at around 90 percent.
"These numbers will surely drop in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a defect that was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light fixture produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
Furthermore, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To configure the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and complete.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
This is often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so they can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
Attention was paid to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and thus designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a swivel joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Disappointing, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
The party we wanted to throw: Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt!
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had previously gone two games without a win, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE turned it up, shot the frustration of a mediocre season start off their shoulders within an hour and won brilliantly with 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which is still in ninth place and not meeting expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What happened next impressed even the SGE coach.
When the players returned and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular optimism for the spectators.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well prepared in terms of personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top shape.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle.
Now one wants to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up, as part of the English week, is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (6:30 PM, Sky).
What grade will I receive when I receive an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part?
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it redirected, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean for me that I won't order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's female handball players slunk off the court with hanging heads and vacant stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to show up differently against Spain.
After their first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the runner-up behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we need to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from start to finish
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start of the game.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
This, however, was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing phase of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game better and at least came within five goals by halftime.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes when the score was 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

I would like to give a gift voucher.
Just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that work for you?
The title suggests it, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Once these are largely completed, it will then continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a specific individual (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include educating people about vaccination, determining eligibility (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and potentially emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have a doctor, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can't (aren't allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer" please?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television show "We in Bavaria" has caused intense contemplation.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also nobody who needs everything to happen quickly.
What the people heard from the TV presenter was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg communicated the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that the Huidlerer is a rag used to wipe the stove.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed a gap in education - likely even for those who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized it, and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Is tire selection really so puncture-proof for road racing?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Shards of glass on the track.
Suddenly, there was a loud hissing sound and my rear tire was no longer willing to continue the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
Although it wasn't too bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to encounter this problem multiple times.
It wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on rollers for several years.
When I think about having to change the tires after 80-90km of driving, I'm probably in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are said to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I'm wondering: I think I have 25x622 on the racing bike right now.
There are apparently Marathon Plus tires that have this, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD more to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best wishes!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, according to the police. He then veered onto the opposite lane.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels nearly unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressive and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the enclosure, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to run the cable through it later without any problems.
Using an overhead router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
Now the back wall, lid, front and bottom will be glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, including both sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next, mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the terminal block.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuumed / blown out), one begins laying the cable.
This is most easily achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
For this, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and is left sticking out there for about 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Next, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box should be sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
With the 35 mm bass reflex opening and some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To soundproof, a mat of the dampening material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello to all,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant an increased planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be connected, so we will be able to follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks ready, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
