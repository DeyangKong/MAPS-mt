Since there are things like that, I don't even feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was too much? Television is only entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were giggling in the background even when they were saying something not particularly funny.
Clearly it's not funny, but it's creepy how people say "you have to laugh at everything they say because they're a popular comedian".
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be ruined, and it would be unpleasant to work with them.
It's like a black company from the past, and that industry seems to be like a physical education association, and some entertainers' egos are too big, so they seem to take a normal unpleasant attitude, and if they don't do that, they won't be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work and say "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but I'm not going to be told every time that being a comedian is a difficult job and that I need to reach the top.
It sounds like a justification for the too high position of comedians in the media and society for the beautification of their own career.
To be honest, there are quite tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel that things related to the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

Ikemoto Printing Press Industries Mail Order
Get the hairbrush ready!
A sample is presented to the purchaser.
The item I ordered from the Tsutaya Net Shop was changed without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper, and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I should return it.
Rather than talking about self-made PCs, it's a problem with online shopping, but I can't accept it no matter how I think about it, so let me write it here since it's a well-known place.
The starting point was when I discovered that the MSI wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop Tsukumo Day Sale that started from last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Link Taku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order email was received normally and the shipping email arrived the next day.
In both of these emails and in the purchase history of my page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the order to the shipment, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point because there was no contact or cancellation notification of the mistake.
Here is the problem, after a few hours of shipping, an email came saying "there was a mistake in the product registration".
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse for a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose the response
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separated, and although the purchase history, emails, and delivery notes are all written as wireless versions, it seems that they were sent as wired versions without permission.
Isn't it terrible that they sent a different product than what I bought without my consent and they want me to return it if I want a refund?
In the end, I want to retaliate with something like accepting a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for marriage or a partner, would you not want to associate with someone whose relationship with their family is bad?

Even with parents and siblings, there can be various personalities and unreasonable people, which can lead to bad relationships.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside was washed away due to a typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies (Fukushima Prefecture Yamai Town) (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachi Hara district in Yamamori-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a significant impact on the lives of the 8-person 3-households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was broken so quickly, like it was swept away," The only road connecting the Takachi Hara District, "Takachi Hara Bridge," was swept away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which was usually not allowed, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually I can drive to the garden, but this time I had to get off the car and carry or carry it across the iron bridge and come here, so I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge was completed a month later, and within three months it was washed away by heavy rain, and it was isolated again for several days until the temporary bridge was put in place.
It has been two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I think we should try to secure at least two to three days' worth of food," said the official. We have stocked up on canned food and cup noodles, which can also be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, but since you don't know when a disaster will strike you, I felt again that it would be better for everyone to prepare a little." On the other hand, Yagi-cho, which experienced an "unexpected disaster" of a bridge being washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Yatsuri Town Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryūichi: "We have established it as 'Yatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards. We have also announced it."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event where people could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympic Games.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were provided, and those who visited the venue wore special equipment to run the marathon course of the Paralympics reproduced in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, an avatar of oneself appears and it is set up so that one can experience a competition running a marathon course together with participants from inside and outside the country, and one can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much, it was really fun!"
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough when running, but it's amazing how you can enjoy it while running, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want people to be able to enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and they plan to set it up after the New Year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The new "Building Condition Survey" system established to activate the used housing market is doing well in used housing transactions.
Both the prices of detached houses and condominiums have been rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of living in one's own home has been increasing due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "in front of the station", "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale" and "tower", and this may also be influenced by the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan still remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a survey called "inspection" for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate and Building Transaction Business Act (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
It can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer's side, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party in charge of building condition surveys is mainly the seller's side.
In addition, it is important to note that only the announcement of the inspection system was made compulsory.
In other words, real estate businesses in charge of intermediation have an obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking overseas, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
Before the sale of a house, the buyer requests a building survey from an expert called an inspector or building surveyor as a preliminary step.
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, 70-90% of the transactions of existing homes are inspected.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead to conduct the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the seller-oriented one.
The seller side will try to show the condition of the building as good as possible, sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey content and thinking of carrying out appropriate repairs so that they can live comfortably.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap between the intentions and thoughts of both sides.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection of the seller-led type inspection prescribed by the country is kept to a minimum.
As it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned project can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections with "sontaku" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller will be conducted.

It was quite hard.
However, I had recovered mentally, so I was full of motivation.
Because I was a researcher and my body wasn't keeping up, I would sometimes fall asleep during work.
Since this was the second time in a year, I thought of taking a break for a month and parting ways with the shitty company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it dragged on for a while.
In any case, it is important to go to a psychiatric hospital and get proper treatment, as well as to keep a record of your visits (extremely important).
If you have a history of hospital visits, even if you resign for personal reasons, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the judgment of a doctor at the Hello Work, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance and so on are greatly reduced.
Even if it's hard to find a job, or if you want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

Was Ginza an island?
Five trivia topics you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula back in the day.
As evidence of that ... ...," it's only in Ginza that you can show off your trivia knowledge.
Let's introduce you to some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to share with someone after you find out about it.
Go up Ginza! ?
First dive into the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history everywhere, such as strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
We were walking in Ginza and suddenly the silence that visited us, "This used to be a peninsula back then."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The symbol of the bustling streets that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" refers to a silver mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shin Ryogae Town," but when it moved to Kogane Town it became known by its nickname, "Ginza."
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
From before the Edo period, a peninsula called "Edomae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza, and a bay called "Iri-E" extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and promoted boat transportation by digging canals.
Then, the soil that had been dug out from the moat and the Kanda mountain were cut down and the inlet was filled in.
Why not try looking for the stone monument of "Ginza's Place of Origin" that indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Ginza Tiffany Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) if you are interested?
A "pilgrimage to the holy land" known only to those in the know in Ginza.
Every year, a "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theatre.
At the shrine standing at the right end of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who come to pay their respects before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryukou Fudouzon" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Desse Jizouzon" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi Ginza Terrace.
The "Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine" and "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" is known for being respected by Ichimura Uzaemon, a kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" where the fox greets you was built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, as it brings the benefit of "abundant harvest of five grains" where the rice grows well.
This eventually led to the benefit of business prosperity being said in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, the most prosperous city in Japan, faith spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if I had hypersensitivity.
The nerve has been removed and the hole remains open.
He said it was to make the pain go away quickly.
Before the treatment, when I touch my teeth, I get a sharp pain, will it get better in a few days...?
The pain reliever doesn't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.
Take care.

Recruitment - How to Compile Scripts & How to Modify Existing Scripts
I looked around a lot and tried my best, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that purpose, but I don't understand how to use the tool, so I want to start from MO2 (without running scripts or resources).
I went through the CKWiki tutorial, but there is only information on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...?

During the Greater East Asia War, were most of the military personnel government officials?
Almost all of them are not, but all of them are now called civil servants.
Since the military itself is an organization of the state, people who are said to be drafted under the conscription system are considered to be state civil servants in terms of organization.

My friend is currently looking for programming and IT jobs in the Kansai area (currently on dispatch), but it doesn't seem like there are many jobs in Osaka or other major cities on LinkedIn *sobs*

A male body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoinagawa River in Nakashidami, Moriyama-ku, and reported it to 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he died at the scene.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity and investigate the cause of death.
On the other hand, an elderly man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Okazaki-shi, Fukuoka-cho, and his death was confirmed.
Although there was no disorder in the men's clothing, there was apparently a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity while investigating the situation at the time.
Regarding the payment of the exemption of the resident tax in the middle of February, if there is one exemption in the household, will it be paid?
It looks like the confirmation documents will be sent out from today...

Korea Postco International has acquired Senex Energy of Australia to expand its overseas gas field business - Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, POSCO International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia, as well as an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the remaining procedures such as the approval at the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the approval of the local corporation, the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since PostCoin International was integrated into the PostCo Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy 49.9%.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas will divide the market with green hydrogen, which led to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Could the pain in your knee be "osteoarthritis" ?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been having continuous knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can be various, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "rheumatoid arthritis".
Editorial Department: Is it that the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to cushion shocks and smooth the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in places other than the knee?
Yes, Mr. Maruyama.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the foot, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial Department: So, what is the structure of a joint?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where these two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage" and the joint is surrounded by "joint capsule".
The editorial department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Inside the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid plays the role of a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the movement of the knee smoother, which is why they are said to be good.
Editorial: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion role, isn't it?
However, if this wears away or becomes distorted, it can cause deformation of the joint and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basically pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the laundry, I come and sleep in something like a tracksuit!
Even for heavy smokers, are there people who can quit smoking and people who can't quit?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he had a feeling of wanting to try stopping, and he ended up stopping as it was.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Experience for Real (with Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game with life at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my feet tingle ... ... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a planning video.
■Swamp The pachinko with traps featured in the gambling abstinence record Kaiji is called "Swamp".
In the original work, Kaiji was surprised by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was equipped with large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-step Krune", and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means available to him and, in the end, resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to cause the foundation to sink and tilt, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The "Iron Crosswalk" that was implemented on the debtors, including Kaiji, at the "Star Side Party" hosted by the wealthy as a pastime was a "Human Horse Race" Iron Crosswalk.
The debtor advances, taking care not to fall off the thin iron frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
12 people can participate and the top two can win a prize, but there are only 4 steel beams, and safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, not only was it developed as a VR game, but it is also possible to experience something very similar at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
This Eagle Bridge has a single iron bridge extending to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and beyond it, there is a "Sky Swing" and a "Victory Bridge" prepared, and you can walk there.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Corera Koraru released a video on his YouTube of walking across the Eagle Bridge, saying that it was an experience that could be had in Japan, and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Divide into Emperor's side and Slave's side, and play with a total of 10 cards, 1 Emperor's card, 8 Citizen's cards, and 1 Slave's card.
This game is very well made, with the emperor being strong towards the citizens, the citizens being strong towards the slaves, and the slaves being strong towards the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
After a long and hard battle, Kaiji realized that his ears were being read by a device that could detect and transmit changes in pulse and body temperature, like the earphones attached to his ears. In order to confuse Ritenkawa, he shaved his ears to the extreme and altered his body to abnormal values, thus winning the battle.
The E-card is commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and other places.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-Cards with actor Ryuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, causing a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the new year, gently pushing forward - a large votive horse of the Tora Shrine in Yamagata Prefecture | Yamagata Shimbun
At the Kenkokuguu Shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, the large votive horse of the zodiac animal of the next year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared.
On the 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine, and an offering ceremony was held in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to create the original drawings for the ema since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese Painting Course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Suehara Toshimitsu, Yuichi Tsuchiya (age 22) was selected.
The large ehma is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya-san said that he painted an image of a cherry blossom pushing gently on one's back as they step into the new year.
Stopping in place, the figure of the tiger looking at the cherry blossom flowers was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, one can still have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature".
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the ema generally distributed.
Gonnegi Kenichi (44) said, "I think I can be of help to everyone in overcoming their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano that wants to continue living" - Proposal to the 4 high school students in the city workshop: SanDigital of the San'in Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai-zukuri Center", the raw voices of young people are compiled and proposed to the mayor.
"What makes you happy?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison, such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed about "interesting town", "livable town" and "town with a sense of purpose" while moving around each with a predetermined theme in the "World Cafe" method.
Write each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems like an interesting town with many young people." "Public transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
Are there any common points? Let's discuss further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the sea is attractive," said Tamano Commercial High School third-year student (18).
The Binan High School third-year students (18) talked with adults, saying "There are few stores and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have a lot of nature," and they seemed to have noticed not only the regional issues but also the charm.
The second meeting in December will be attended only by high school students to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the director of education and make an announcement in February next year.
The president of the same center said, "We will foster the attachment of high school students to their hometown, and it will be a trigger for young people to take the initiative in town development."
In the Kanto region, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake with a seismic intensity of 4 was reported with the epicenter in the southern part of Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News

According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, with a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be M5.0.
There is no concern about the tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake varies by location.
Shindo 4 = Kuki, Kasama Ishii (Ibaraki), Tsuchiura Taisho, Kiryu Nishi-Kata (Tochigi), Ota Nishi-machi (Gunma), Saitama Iwatsuki-ku, Kazo (Saitama) etc. ▽ Shindo 3 = Mito (Ibaraki), Utsunomiya (Tochigi), Maebashi Horikoshi (Gunma), Kawagoe Shinjuku (Saitama), Chiba Hanamigawa (Chiba), Otemachi (Tokyo), Tsurumi Suehiro (Kanagawa) etc. ▽ Shindo 2 = Koriyama Konan (Fukushima), Hitachi (Ibaraki), Kanuma (Tochigi), Takasaki (Gunma) etc.

How to Find - New Way to Wind a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the knack.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that would not wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, and then I found something innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I saw it for the first time, I thought, "Can it be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece by weaving the fabric cut in a long and narrow shape, and the whole is in a mesh pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edges of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, you can wind it up and secure it without joining the ends together.
It is very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (vests) are popular, but many people will combine them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
Get Buck is a Peter Jackson directed movie.
It feels like the Beatles in their full, raw form, and it's all so fresh...
We're on the brink of disbanding, so there's a certain tension, but it's not the dramatic tension I was imagining.
While doing his best to keep order, Paul, who was kind of annoying with his "I know I'm being annoying, but come on!", George, who was kind of grumbling with his "But, you know...", John, who was kind of listless and often late despite his comments and jokes, and Ringo, who was kind of the peacemaker but didn't really take an active role, and just sat there with a "This is so troublesome" expression...
We didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very familiar atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had the same feeling. What would you call it, a legendary breakdown?
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of creating a great song from a small phrase, where we ask each other "how about this one?", is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is incredible.
A subtle hum-hum-hum like a nose song gradually became a zucha♪ zucha♪ and the scene where the lyrics came in was firmly recorded, it's amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, it doesn't happen often.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is playing with so much enthusiasm that just watching the performance can make you happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three has been released so far, but my impression is that the biggest cause of the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
Although the four of them would start making music while complaining about this and that, when it came to the topic of where to hold their live performance, the producer and other people in charge of promotion would start talking in a Beatles-like manner, saying things like "Let's make it the best in the world!" It was easy to see that the members had already lost control of the situation.
Well, since documentaries involve the director's interpretation, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe the reason why there are a lot of scenes where Paul looks like a villain is because he is supposedly supervising it.

How strong is Berserk's Guts compared to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't do it
Don't call out the technique name before performing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you have been feeling a sense of responsibility and it has been gradually taking away your peace of mind.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I was originally in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I felt like I was really suited to sales activities that customers asked for, so I switched jobs to a different industry and it has become much easier to work.
Even though I was asked about what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do in my heart, my life will be a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest so that you can have some peace of mind before considering this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there is a labor union at the company, an industrial doctor or a window for consultation, it may be better to consult there, as there may be some system.
It would be great if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have occurred frequently in the United States, causing great damage, due to the unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold weather (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes broke out mainly in the southern United States.
It is believed that, due to the strong cold air coming down from the record-breaking warmth of this season, the atmosphere became very unstable and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest to the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on both Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air below -30°C near 5500m in the sky, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, which was a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and strong winds in just one day (Friday) local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength (on the Fujita scale) reached the third strongest level out of six, with gusts of wind reaching around 70m/s.
According to future surveys, there is a possibility that it will be classified as EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, which corresponds to the tornado in the United States this time, has a high possibility of occurring in Japan and is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

The voices of those asking for help from the "largest in history" rice dragon roll under the rubble were broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his views on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
Reported by US CNN TV and others.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the death toll will exceed 100.
In Kentucky, which suffered damage from tornadoes, residents carry household goods and furniture from damaged houses. From the evening of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
As far as the scope of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that caused damage in Missouri and other places in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the largest scale at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Meadfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that was operating 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas season also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
Trapped under a thick pile of rubble about 1.5 meters deep in the darkness, the female victim felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above the rubble and asked for help via a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the broadcasted live stream, the song "Happy Birthday to You" sung by another woman in tears, presumably to distract from the fear, could also be heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued, and they were safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumble from the earth," he reflected.
The police officer of the Mayfield City Police said, "The search activities will continue until they are no longer necessary."
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take, but I continued the rescue efforts earnestly.
In Illinois, part of an Amazon warehouse collapsed, resulting in at least six confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of being separated from the carriages, and the highway is also being blocked one after another due to the effects of car overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What can I do to increase it?
Take high-protein foods and drinks
Avoid coarsely chopped raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

Living on welfare is tough...
Praying that something can be done
It would be great if there were "live-in work opportunities" like inns and resort jobs that would provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation of the coronavirus pandemic.
I did a quick search and it looks like there is a site like this ↓,
Live-in Part-time Job - Live-in Recruitment Navi (Suminavi)
There are "bargain, live-in, work" in the related search, so it seems that there are many colleagues like that.
For bank accounts and line contracts, if you have an address for the first time, it will somehow work, but for credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't update without an address (because a new card is sent to the registered address).
What does it mean to be a specialist doctor in gynecology?
A "specialist doctor" is a doctor in the 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Advanced Trainee Doctor".
The so-called "resident" refers to the "initial resident", which refers to doctors in the first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, when I reach 4 to 5 years of experience, I will be able to do a certain level of medical care, and I will be entrusted with various tasks.

There has been a long-standing discourse that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries deduct points from a five-star rating system, the argument is that Japan should take a neutral three-star rating and add or subtract points from there.
At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings, "there are elements that are deducted" and "it is not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we base it on five stars, it will be the same for both "a work without any flaws" and "a work at the highest level in every aspect", so if there is such a tendency, I think it would be a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since it is actually operated in such a system, I understand why you would like not to give three stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, if you try to refute those who advocate this view with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity from a USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump varies depending on the model, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.
The numbers are vastly different.

Making a Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the one I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right..
So, getting to the point, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems to be picking up FM radio.
Why do you think so? Is there such a thing?
Is it okay to delete the ESPs for SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a Loose file in an appropriate location, it does not need ESP.
I remember seeing something about that somewhere, but I can't remember where...
I understand the risks, so I don't plan to actually do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If there is someone who remembers, please let me know if it is okay to do.
Thank you for your contribution.

<Saga Eating Record> "Hakobune" "Freshly Fried Fish and Shrimp Fried with Homemade Tartar Sauce" | Living・Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce."
"Hakobune," a take-out specialty shop with colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes, using plenty of vegetables.
"We opened in August last year so that people can experience the restaurant atmosphere even at home," said Takayuki Kousuke (39) and Yumi (38) couple.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Fried fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available at the market at that time.
According to Mr. Kiyoshi, the material texture of the fry can be directly understood by making the raw bread flour as thin as possible, and the texture of the shrimp fry is crisp.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Saga-produced Hinohikari rice mixed with grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are sourced from the family-grown field next to the house, or from direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dish changes depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyo has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, they have a mix of Japanese and Western flavors that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, such as the "comforting taste of rolled eggs" (Yumi-san).
The bento box "Hand-kneaded Hamburg Steak made with domestic blended meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and there was something interesting so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it sometimes shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
Of course, it's slow.
I think it's safe because I slowed down when there were people around and sometimes stopped completely, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze of the people around me hurts; it's good to be seen, but it feels like they're saying "What a nuisance" and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if there were some consideration, such as asking them to move to the side.
Specifically, I think it would be good to create dedicated lanes so that they don't interfere with people walking.
I thought it was a great vehicle because I could relax and take in the scenery while taking it slowly, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a vehicle that was difficult to ride for those who were not owners of a heart with a lot of patience, with a sense of excitement for the near future, such as whether this kind of automated driving will become mainstream in the future, and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you might understand a bit, but this is a bowl of eel without any sauce.
It's actually "!Nasu!" (Tap to get the correct answer)!
I like eel, but when I thought that everyone is just eating it with sauce and that the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly...I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I don't want the eel to go extinct, but I just felt like eating eel.
Recipe Used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (Sprinkled with sansho pepper instead of scallions.)
I just fried it in a pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.

One man was cut off and escaped on a motorcycle on the 12th in Saga City's Ozai, attempted murder case | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, on the street in Daizai 1-chōme in Saga City, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s, and suffered facial injuries.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and Saga South Police Station is pursuing him as a attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "they are fighting".
The man sustained an approximately 10 centimeter long and 1 centimeter deep wound on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away was medium-built with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities at the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong enterprise Find Asia corporate consultant) China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the number of mammal species being the highest in the world and the number of plant species being the third highest in the world.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection by local governments but also activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan Province in Southwest China, Xishuangbanna (also known as Sipsongpanna) is also one of these regions.
Ms. Li Wanda, my younger sister, is currently active as an actress. Si Sa Phan Na is an area bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group sharing the same roots as the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River flowing through Southeast Asian countries is flowing.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people (Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture) covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Ms. Li Minhua in person at Sichuan-Tibet Plateau and heard about her environmental protection activities.
Starting environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activities "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The trigger for that was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seychelles for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and it was proud of its numerous biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to root an industry in this region and to produce rubber which was lacking in China, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests was carried out previously.
He was dispatched here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here I met a journalist I knew and got married.
Before that, did Mr. Li not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li, I am from Cispanana, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I had to push forward the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or an especially tall stature, I sometimes see people who have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out in the moment you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of self-confidence on the inside.

I was just wondering, is it too detailed to comment on someone's outfit or say something like "that color looks nice"?
It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I haven't been told to praise in detail, so I'm not quite sure what it means.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yokomine Sakura?
"My heart is blooming with joy after your confession, I'm honored. Let's start going out together."
And, in order to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open an Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at a later time?
It will be completed faster if it is set up at the same time.
It will be completed in about a week.
We recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to, without any fees.

【Omakan/Personal Note】It took about one and a half months to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
Due to lack of playtime since the Golden Week, multiple CTDs caused by various factors have occurred until March, and it took a long time to identify them as we could only investigate a little bit during the holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes don't remain in the crash log.
The main timing of CTD
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins that log.
When accumulating NPC kills / attacks: Activation with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / powerofthree's SE update restart version) OFF for improvement * Is there a possibility of wet clothes for this?
For some NPCs, camera work for activating kill moves is set to OFF via .ini to improve the basic settings: Is there a conflict in the settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 for DAR animations.
(Mainly outdoors) During field movement + some magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use the Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application settings (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times in a row to improve everything.
Could it be caused by additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although the 2.0 SPID default.ini has a formatting mistake, it should result in the intended result and the NPCs should have the underlying Perk applied.
At first, we focused on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MOD (.dll) and we got this kind of result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there were any people who had the same CTD problem in a Japanese language environment, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it.
Everyone is doing it with barely enough mental strength.
Nobody around him noticed it, not even his colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, wow, that person looks like they're having a tough time, but they're still working hard and staying energetic.
I guess he's also on the brink of mental exhaustion.
I haven't retired in name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits-After today's visit is finished
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, the home visit nurse does the necessary things for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply impressed by how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and we even joked around about it.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desires, or why she got divorced, or is it okay to do that kind of thing in visiting nursing?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations operated by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that when an occupational therapist visits for visiting nursing, they are given orders from above in a condescending manner, such as "We are providing medical care here".
I am using a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, but I think the nurses are really good, facing me equally and frankly even though I have a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There will be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits and those who are considering receiving them.
Home visits from nurses are very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had difficulty agreeing and have had to cancel contracts from my end.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was still startled when it came up in English.
Why does it come out in English?

I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.
Language detection malfunction
The browser settings are set to English priority.
The ranking of the lottery 6 draws by the number of appearances is all odd numbers.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One Fifth of China ... "Delayed in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japanese Version) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The content was that by 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be popularized (cumulative) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, according to the November standards, fuel cell vehicles are not reaching the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The target for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 places), and the price per kilo of hydrogen is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been found that the government's performance of the hydrogen economy roadmap has fallen far short of the target value.
On the 12th, the National Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) released the report "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The carbon fiber core material of fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are lower-ranked among competing countries."
The order of patent applications by country is China, USA, EU, Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) to become the fourth highest, but it was still at the 22% level of China (4721).
The Zenkeiren proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large amount of investment and research and development expenses deductible from taxes."
It has been a month and a half since the surgery was performed by cutting the tendon of the finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is a little swollen and it hurts when I move my hand in the affected area.

Was the number of older sisters and wives compared to now smaller during the Meiji and Showa eras?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so common that the phrase "sister-in-law wife" is spoken in the streets.
And, it seems that in those days, since it was said that "even if you wear a golden headscarf, look for a wife who is one year older," there were probably more wives who were older than now during the Meiji and Showa eras.

Is it a crime to sell something at a higher price than the regular price in a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at the store for 70,000.
It is legal.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in rare value compared to the fixed price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and have their prices increase.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the original price.

Takaizumi is progressing with the reform of the council, and the "communication book" of the council members is also: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Town Council of Takasu is working on unique council reforms, such as creating an eye-catching flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate their council members.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive no-vote, aiming to get the townspeople to take an interest.
To inform about the Sunday Assembly to be held on the 12th, 1800 new leaflets were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"From Morning to Night" "Tetsuko's Room" "In Search of Inosuke Series" ...
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th has lively wording that evokes the name of a popular TV program.

US aid weapons and ammunition have arrived in Ukraine, and troops are also engaged in training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by the 12th.
The military assistance is equivalent to a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, etc., will be transported to Ukraine from the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages also included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the reinforcement of forces carried out by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is strengthening its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military and is also discussing with NATO member countries to draw up countermeasures in case Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House in September of this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, in accordance with a multilateral joint training program to support Ukraine, state troops from the US state of Florida were dispatched.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US special operations forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also shown a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hands" of lifetime gifts, direct hit on Masaru Amano, former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is a "pre-mortem gift and rush inheritance technique".
While the discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the fiscal year 2022, which was a concern, but in the near future, the possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" is great.
How will the rules of succession change?
I will impart everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques, in order to make it in time for the end-of-year rush of advantageous gifts, with a direct hit to former Tax Commission Chairman, Kamei Meiji Diet Member.
(Diamond Editing Department, Kei Miyahara)
From wealthy families to urban company employees, the pre-death gift giving should be a "forbidden hand." From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with a full-scale examination towards constructing a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer.
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because the implication is to change the rules of succession and increase inheritance tax by prohibiting the "gift before death" which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures.
The iron rule for tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is "reducing the assets subject to taxation".
The pre-mortem gift, the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by employees in the three major metropolitan areas who have a small amount of inheritance tax generated from their homes.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although it was not included in the outline of the tax system reform for fiscal year 2022 announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, a more detailed statement was made to unify the policy, such as "Review the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "The non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted) We will continue to review it.”
Former LDP Tax System Research Chairman and former Secretary-General Kanemaru said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the time of transfer of property and to make the tax burden the same whenever it is done.
Currently, what kind of problems will arise from (integration) is being simulated. If the fastest amendment is made, there are only three chances left for a lifetime gift.
Even without that, it seems likely that in the near future, a big step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10th, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】Yamaya Kajun as the heroine, the story is a heartbreaking pure love story of a man and a woman carrying the past, based on the same-named manga by Morie Satoshi serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa and the heroine, Rise, is played by Yamayagi Kanjū.
Rise, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Kai.
Kaori, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Rise is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but is Kairi a murderer due to some cause?
Yuudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
Those who were not able to watch FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already watched it can understand the complexity of the psychological depiction of Kairi and Risou, as well as the changes in the two of them, and get to know this work even more deeply.
I am delighted if even the fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Look forward to it!

After the team won the NFL game with three passes, what did the players feel and how (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in history.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with their running game of LeSean McCoy and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, a wind of 18 m/s was blowing fiercely, and it was snowing before the game.
Since the Bulls were local, they didn't make many changes to their play selection.
Pass 30 times versus Run 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was certainly not a failure.
There were four red zone penetrations in the 10 offensive series and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late stages of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to score 3 points in one FG in the three times.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bulls, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty at 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
Then he threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the endzone, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, Ace WR Stephon Digs was running a slant route and was open in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the end zone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant and ended in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen overlooked two receivers and threw a pass aiming for the end zone twice.
The 4th down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on the 3rd down.
You should get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if he had made it to 4th and Short, Allen's own run should have come to life due to his abilities.

It's about time for the "throw away time" and "replace time" - three items that are often left in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably not as often as recommended, but it's probably a sponge.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (although it is still recommended to sterilize in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The US Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when the cutting board starts to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria multiply.
If still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or lightly pat with a clean paper towel to remove the water.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked
It may be painful to dispose of your favorite mug, but the broken surface could become a new warm bed for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of chapped lips and spilled drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged Righteous General Guan Yu, posted by Builder Yujin
Submerged hero Guan Yu said, "Oi, Yu Jin!"
No smoking.
"Yukin wouldn't die even if 30,000 arrows came raining down on him."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get swallowed up by the muddy waters of the river, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"So can we hold out for three quarters of an hour in a water assault and underwater bridge?"
"Ussu Ussu"
"So let's practice so we can endure until the next battle at Sekigahara!"
"Ussu!"
Is it a promise?
"I understand!"
"Someday you'll be killed by Cao Cao and I won't even know!"
Saying that, the righteous general returned.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water attack water bridge three-quarter practice! We absolutely can't do it unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and sink into a cage.
Did you read the article at the link even though you quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community market and trade are two different things.
At the community market, we use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been victims of scams where they are left with only items and no money paid.
That won't happen
Trade is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different conversation?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even with simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even with intellectual labor.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I swapped out the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen became black with a white cursor-like dot that didn't blink and stayed there.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to be finished in about 5 minutes, but it won't finish in an hour.
Possible causes are an old USB memory stick or using an SD card converted for use.
Have you overslept and become sluggish?
Is there any other similar cause?
Do you dislike men with a poker face all the time?
Oh! I saw an acquaintance.
He always had a face like a baga bondo.
I wasn't particularly disliked.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
If it's something inconspicuous, I can carry it, but I can't carry something like Louis Vuitton with a monogram with "Lv" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one you're talking to in a rude way?"
If they say it doesn't matter because they are a foreigner, it's best to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I'm dreaming of feeling uncomfortable with a pretty good probability.
I was living abroad halfway, but the Japanese who went out, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette, and there were quite a few people who came, and I misunderstood that I could say anything to the locals.
If it looks like a Westerner, I don't think there's any malice, it's more like a kind of spoiled feeling or a friendly attitude.
Even though my friends are from Europe and America, I sometimes get a little confused about whether to use their first or last names when speaking in Japanese.
Well, it's still okay if it's with friends.
It may be that originally it was just a normal, pure thing, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say it now.
Can you talk to me according to Japanese rules because it's Japan?
Study: My white American friend who is naturalized has a habit of raising his glass higher than the others at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but in that way, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
No matter what their personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details, so it's annoying.

Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created sub had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, there were 25 subscribers, so I thought it would take a little longer to get to 50, but for some reason today 25 people subscribed, so I'm really grateful.
For those of you who subscribed to this sub-reddit today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let us know in the comments section where you heard about this sub-reddit! (I have no idea so I'm really curious!)
Currently, there is only one person creating threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.
Even if you don't start a thread, your comments will be encouraging.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
People who use Twitter, please be sure to start a thread!
Finally, thank you very much! The sub-group I made before didn't gather people as I thought, so it quickly failed, but this time, thanks to everyone, it seems that I can continue without giving up.
We will do our best to maintain the wiki and rules, and make the sub-reddit easier to use, so please continue to support us!

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of the wording, but I understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I'm only saying this based on how I feel, so it might be a good idea to ask others as well).
You often see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, it feels like they are well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it may take a long time of study to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, I suggest you look for someone else.

I think that there are various reasons why people want to live alone regardless of where they are, so it depends on the individual how they think about it.

Consideration: Training is the battle in Demon Slayer.
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Start Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the fact that there is an excessive amount of training.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles and the characters train regardless of day or night, is not popular among readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the two-year training of the Straw Hat Pirates when they separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE" was only touched upon and the rest was glossed over, so it should be known.
Well, one-piece is one of the attractions of the wandering land, but there are times when "staying in the same place and training" does not match well.
So, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began when he knelt before Togako Yiyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, and was told by Yiyu, "Don't let someone else hold the power of life and death!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they are only forced down by the powerful... ...
While saying that, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains the applicants of the Demon Slayer Corps (even though he is not good at communicating his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" Tanjiro was at a loss for words, so Rengoku delivered a single punch with the comment "You take too long to decide".
Among the fans, it's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of words.
However, taking my sister who has become an ogre out for a walk carries the possibility that I may be forced to make such a judgment at some point.
It could be said that initiation is the preparation for training.
Rin Takadzuki tells Tanjiro to take him to Mount Sagiri, even though Tanjiro is still an amateur, and to make it down to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls such as air holes and rock-throwing machines, and traps, and it seems like one could die before even starting the training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he can barely detect the faint scent of the trap set by a person and somehow avoid it, which is called the "Protagonist Correction".
Nevertheless, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba that makes Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so powerful that I can avoid all of it!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any proof, and awakening is just using the power and techniques that have been honed so far to their full potential.
"Effort Equivalence Exchange", which rewards those who make an effort with an equivalent reward and nothing to those who do not make an effort, is a human anthem that differs from the supernatural power of an oni with no basis, and is a difficult rule to move consistently throughout this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping without a bed, directly on the floor with a futon, a quilt, and a comforter is a way of sleeping.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will it be difficult?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "stingy".
I think of it as "gimlet-eyed" to plan to get more benefit than effort with the minimum effort.

Samsung Electronics of Korea established a new "DX Department" integrating home appliances and mobile phones, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into a single division called the DX (Device eXperience) division, the company announced on the 12th that it would reflect this in its organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be read that the intention is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX department is composed of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network, which were integrated from the CE and IM departments.
Samsung Electronics personnel explained that the name change this time reflects a medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, they emphasized their intention to enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
The strategy of creating synergies on a company-wide scale and building a foundation for differentiated products and services by surpassing the boundaries between organizations was also reflected in the name with the launch of the integrated leadership system.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500BCE mean before the common era?
What would it be like to say it in Japanese?
It was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of the notation BCE in recent years based on the idea that it should be used.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

Although there are matters of preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would fit a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I would like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait, their jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their trap is impaled and pulled underneath.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand to catch prey, showing only the disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand, ready to capture their prey, with only their disc-shaped head visible above the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from an ant's perspective?
I wonder?
If you translate "armoured heads" into "circular head", the part "It is a giant beast wearing an armor in ant scale" will disappear, right...?
24 Vehicles Collide in Aichi Prefecture, Truck Driver Has No Pre-Existing Illness, Was it Carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
It has been found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in which 24 cars collided, had no chronic illness and that it is believed that the accident was caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the first collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, Nomura suspect had no illness and it was found that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises of the related parties and investigating the situation in detail at that time.

"Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News"
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from Volume 3, will conclude in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted everything from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to its focus on only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but what should be noted first is that it is not a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes that are quite different from before, so we can't go to the match, but it's not necessarily boring.
As the tension gradually increases with the start of the century's war, the feeling in the work is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly amazing that even this period was calculated as part of the production.
And before the important final, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place deciding match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxuriousness as a battle card, what I like is that before the match, the Ramen Man shouts "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!" towards the Kinnikuman poster.
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, received the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with a silent stare and everyone leaving the place.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a passionate debate about Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
When a character stands up, this is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now!
The fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was the appeal of the Ramen Man's tears after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of fate only for Kinnikuman!"
It is a line of dialogue.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers of Kinnikuman have been feeling a sort of implicit understanding that the protagonist will never lose and somehow always come out on top, even in situations where it isn't a matter of strength.
However, by making Ramenman say this statement, Yudetamago-sensei had already stabbed the dagger that he could no longer use his hand.
With this one phrase, the reader thinks, "Wait, does Kinnikuman really defeat Robin with his strength?"
How do you do it?
It will surely stimulate our imagination with its unpredictable development, and from the perspective of a creator, this is like a line of dialogue that the creator has imposed on himself.
Wow, you did an amazing thing!
I definitely think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aoba Mountain in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
In Takahama-cho Nakayama's Aoba-yama Herbal Village, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "I was surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find this place."
She said it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healed while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, the 25th, a Christmas event is planned, with a button pot and a movie screening.
I think that there are only a few people who can read through the documents in order.

It is easier to understand and apply if you learn from Linux rather than starting with something abstract like Docker.
It's quite tough to suddenly understand everything by skipping over that.
If you understand, that's good.
You don't have to do it in order.
Instead of memorizing the contents, just remember the parts you skimmed through and read them when necessary.

The Yonezawa Agricultural Promotion Association is broadcasting a net delivery and livestock product PR from Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for now.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp will light up for a moment and the fan will move, but it will stop immediately.
After that, he said nothing.
Even if I unplug the power plug and try again, it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and the ATX 20-pin and 4-pin and removing all other parts, the computer still does not start up.
5.) I have heard a buzzing sound before, so I suspect that it might be caused by the PSU, as it seems like something is hitting it.
I'll try to find an ATX power supply that I have left over and try it out the next day.
Probably.
If it doesn't work out...I wonder what I should do.
Change the case and the mother together...?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?

How do you dispose of computers and peripherals?
Computer farm
I've brought it in once, but even though it's in Saitama-shi, Misato-shi, Saitama Prefecture, they won't collect it for free from Saitama Prefecture.
Relatively newer ones are free.
Inverse Net
I haven't used it, but it seems that Sagawa is completely free with cash on delivery shipping.
I would like to hear the opinion of anyone who knows it, as I am thinking of trying it out.
* Bulk waste etc. (fee-based), additional note> Collection box of the municipality (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it secondhand.
Addendum > Mercari, Hard Off
Have people ever sold used PCs at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold one.
It might be a wise choice to sell while it is still worth money.
* Addendum> Linet Japan Information Provided: /u/CheetahPresent8059
The broken printer that no one will take, the old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's being put off for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulating outside of the country have no value...
In Japan, bills can be exchanged but coins cannot be exchanged.
Since commemorative coins contain gold, they have value.
Even if he hasn't done anything wrong, can you still dislike him?
Yes, it is natural to have likes and dislikes since we are human.
People who don't like something (for no reason) are like that.

She can't do it, is she being discriminated against based on her looks?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that you can judge by appearance.
It can't be seen on the surface.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduating?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, Yome was still in her room wear. LOL
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
Though all lust and youth are lost.
If you are healthy.
Men's Volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's Fencing, Freer finishes in 4th place without a medal.
Dragon God Japan, 8th place for the first time in 29 years! Men's Volleyball Japan Representative advances to the Final T. Coach Nakagaki "It was a big goal".
When I was taken in the third set with a referee challenge x2, I thought it was no good, but I won the full set.
The men's foil team fencing failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
I think they were in a different league than the opponents leading up to the semi-finals, but why are they in the 3rd place decider?
I would like to plant trees in the garden to provide privacy, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As a hope, it would be nice if it was a evergreen tree that was easy to maintain and preferably one that produces fruit.
Thank you in advance.
To get fruit from a feijoa tree, it is best to plant other fruiting trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby so that the feijoa tree will bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to live together without any difficulty?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of parting.
It is best to make a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Co-habitation has no benefits.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-release legendary rare (^_^;)
Is there any game that uses cards like Ganbaraising as a hobby?
I think it's a ant.
