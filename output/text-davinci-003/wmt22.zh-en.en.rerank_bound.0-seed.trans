At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students sang the lead role and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Network
Washing hands with air, sniffing to diagnose diseases, accurately searching for sources of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of innovative academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensors: your home health checkup doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the College of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a deep breath, and this instrument can preliminarily detect your body's health condition from the components of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target, and its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: the high-energy eyes of the doctor
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected or removed in time, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate according to the operation needs and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and looking cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand-washing device".
As soon as we stand on the apparatus's washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
"So, we can get our hands clean!"
The colorimetric test and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold award.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are emergency rescue measures taken in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really suffer from heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, and sudden respiratory arrest, then we only have four minutes of life window, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, how important it is for people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is too terrible.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
Across the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founding member of First Reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, squeezing the person's chest is of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are the only possible way to save someone.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Who knows, it might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but it was indeed accomplished!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The shrimp dumplings for 13 yuan, only one!?
Never tried
How come #NAME# doesn't make it clear?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# delivered only one shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie, in all senses of the word.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, then at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching it, and "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly a genius when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creature from a Clix novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you might suspect if there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but after careful consideration, you find out that it is actually just a pile of crap.
First, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad were very reassured about it.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
How can a small gang of island bikers easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck drivers around could not be found.
The prop's sentiment is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and criminal suspicion become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't they call the police when facing usury, and the police in the movie even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the entire movie, and it is so far-fetched that I feel pain when I recall it.
Worse than the plot is the movie's theme, or rather, that the movie has no theme at all, it is just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it might be an inspirational film, half way through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for young people in a small town to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep self-doubt, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the crap during the big holiday.
For most people, they are very familiar with the plot of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town youth who likes to ride a motorcycle and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played was just burned, and then the character who could still sing), you can't go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female protagonist, who is obviously not mentally challenged but behaves in some ways like a five-year-old child, I really don't know if this is due to her acting or the director's requirement.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to add trouble to the audience?

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system, where admission is equivalent to being a qualified employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded by the pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific posts, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentices on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise jointly design a talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a pilot period for the cultivation of the educational system. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program. The top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, an enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated personnel training between schools and enterprises, and effectively improving students' job skills, to improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Although Omecamivir has strong transmission power, most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more prone to falling into severe cases due to coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta outbreaks, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to gather enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the past few weeks had severe conditions, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while the death rate of the early outbreak cases in South Africa was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's still early, we need to get the later data.
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only had two weeks to enter this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delta still being the main coronavirus strain in the world, cases of the Omega variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Haoden Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Times Commentary: What Can Save Abducted Children?
If we use the famous public welfare slogan "No buying and selling, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for trafficking, group prevention and control, and everyone against trafficking, make trafficking lucrative, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app is "Reunion", I feel a warm sense of comfort.
The new technological means not only has a name of "literature and art" full of sentiment, but also is properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of cracking down on child abduction is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed with many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the human trafficking case is cracked, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Weighing the importance and urgency of the matter, under the urgent purpose of "rescue", topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punished with the death penalty" which are controversial and have many different opinions can be put aside for now and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of trafficked children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, human traffickers are used to leaving the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
One minute delay in the abduction action may cause the child to be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case investigation will also increase.
In this situation, taking out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which can directly help to solve the case and find the child, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "kidnapping" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from family to society.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at the train station, the parents fell asleep and woke up to find the child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest, or placing the child under safe protection, are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the buyers of abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
With the trend of leniency in sentencing, the crime of trafficking in children obviously belongs to the category of heavier punishment with higher starting points and maximum penalties.
Even today, there are still many cases of human trafficking occurring every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on the strict enforcement of the authorities.
If the "market" of abduction is widely present, traffickers' greed will be aroused and they will constantly innovate abduction means, forming a "contest of law" situation with law enforcement officers, and the anti-trafficking action will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the whole conference, the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial party congress to learn, integrate and understand, enhance the ideological, political and action awareness of "two establishment" and "two maintenance", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the party's hundred-year history. Yang Haodong answered one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young party members to draw strength from the party's hundred-year struggle history, to unite closely around the Central Party Committee, to firmly follow the party, and to use their youth to contribute to responsibility and responsibility.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the rider's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigable
I hope you understand
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than what was shown.
No more, thank you.
Yes, I have already changed the rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
Waited for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
It can be divided into three levels according to the different acidity.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3% is refined, or known as "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil obtained by extraction and refining from pomace through a solvent process.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be known that olives, just like grapes used for making wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, producing olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and there are also countries with similar climates such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., located far in the southern latitudes.
The month for olive picking:
From March to June each year, is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for fruit picking (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded, with Biden declaring that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also expressed that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs committee member Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, realize transparent accountability governance, and be better able to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat of the (Chinese Communist Party) to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason why we must change."
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan's Administrative Deputy Minister Tang Feng released the "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of resistance against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly on the front line of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global regression of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down fake news to win.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Department of Treasury announced sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally #NUMBER#
Well, I won't call then.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier if you can't deliver it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
We waited for a meal for an hour and a half.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hi, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find something at a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, the expensive ones will usually be more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level shots" are actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold on, and even experts find it difficult to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so hard, they know you can't learn it, they also know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so they make a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to me to buy the expensive ones then, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly better second-hand racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one costs 500-600, and a second-hand one costs 200. Isn't it enjoyable to have a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I need to ignore the previous one?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing and the sesame chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I should take it for no reason, please cancel it.
My order is for delivery, there is absolutely no pick-up involved.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with slightly overweight bodies when it comes to dressing.
Girls with a bigger body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you divide your outfit into three sections, upper, mid and lower, you will appear to have naturally increased your height. If you choose different colors for the upper body, skirt and long socks, it will create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and the noble and elegant black skirt is also the first choice for slightly plump girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Plump girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with fine grids). Choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and match it with a drape neck top to cover up the shortcomings of the plump girl.
Of course, there are also standards for girls with a little bit of extra weight when it comes to wearing short skirts.
A fat girl should choose a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her plump figure look taller.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN pairing for summer!
If you are an MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous-looking mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your strengths.
A-line skirts are slimming and are more suitable for chubby girls. Tight-fitting tops can create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt is also an option for plus-sized women to try.
Even a slightly chubby girl can wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, let's also exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of "slightly fat girl" one day earlier 😄

Xinhua All Media + Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Ignites Winter Olympics Passion - Xinhua Net
On December 11th, Beijing Dreaming Team player Pang Yaotian (middle) shot the ball during the game.
On the same day, the 2021-2022 Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued to compete in major ice rinks in Beijing.
This league is divided into regular season and playoffs, with participants aged from U6 to U18. The groups are divided into competitive and selection groups, attracting nearly 3600 players from 256 representative teams in the city.
The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has developed for more than ten years and has now become a platform for Beijing youth ice hockey enthusiasts to exchange skills and make friends, and to provide excellent players for the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Team and Youth Team.
The league plays a driving role in the Beijing youth ice hockey sports, igniting the enthusiasm for the Winter Olympics and laying the foundation for the development of Beijing ice hockey sports in the post-Winter Olympics period.
The girl acted as a target for her sister to raise donations: "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News.
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board at the Wulin Square in Hangzhou. On the board, it reads "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows that a girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stands in front of a slightly higher wooden board with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" indicating that passersby can use a bow and arrow after payment.
The behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl did such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl on the street was warned for soliciting donations for her "arrow target"
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
The police officers of the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was on the side shouting, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali and she is raising donations for her elder sister Ji Jiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 in treatment costs, unable to think of a good way to raise funds, this action was taken.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as the target and one as the assistant, were involved but not in shooting, and no one was found shooting arrows. Only some people were watching and taking pictures, which were then posted on Weibo.
After the police department's security assessment, the bow and arrow used does not fall within the scope of control.
The responsible person stated, "We do not advocate this kind of fundraising approach to gain public attention."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: good Thin degree: convenient Appearance material: satisfactory Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, four exhaust outlets for heat dissipation without any problem, worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is really good, with good workmanship and materials, so you can trust the brand!
The price of Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is still not expensive.
Personally, I think Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. Game performance: The game performance is comfortable, and I can play most games smoothly. My chicken eating is all high frame rate and very smooth. LOL is not a problem, CSgo is also easy to handle, and most three-a games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is powerful, the work is quite quiet, and the game effect is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance Material: Cool and stylish appearance, the game's own cool Display Effect: The screen is clear, playing games 1080 is enough.
Buying a laptop feels really good, mainly for design, good value for money, lighter than expected, and better looking than expected. The red on the butt is a very nice color of wine, not so garish, overall much higher than expected, worth buying, and suitable for girls.
I started to use the Acer Nitro Knight two years ago and it has a high cost-performance ratio and excellent quality after two years.
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
We have already purchased three machines from this series!
It has a beautiful appearance and good configuration.
I wanted to wait for the 418 Bank activity to buy something for my nephew, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I didn't catch up with the bank's big event, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back to review after a period of time.
A brand new original, high cost-performance game laptop, with a good design style, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a computer for the kid to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the kid said it can be used without any problem, this computer can do 3D design work with good performance.
He said it was great that I bought it for my son.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't understand just ask, highly recommend buying.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really nice.
What is the hottest thing in 2021?
No doubt it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and saving fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
Although it appears to be a joke, this article also expresses the daily hardships of project managers, representing the current lack of motivation in project management work.
And personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related difficulties.
Judging from the increasing number of applicants for PMP (Project Management Professional Certification) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide is nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people is about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing working environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners indicate that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on and on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance and communication not smooth, and the project difficult to advance...

On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people marvel at the increasing strength of national consumption power, on the other hand, we have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the youth is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation has a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even leading to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, CSC Credit has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities and launching innovative practice competitions, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the misunderstanding of consumption and loan, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Always plan ahead when spending, and pay back on time according to your financial capacity.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car or buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stay of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the efforts to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in both countries.
The Gulf Arab states resolving differences in order to restore relations with Qatar is driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iranian nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) - a Gulf Arab state agreement condemned for its inability to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the GCC unity and to propose measures for its member states to fully cooperate in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good.
It is said to be the loudest supercar exhaust sound in the New Mountain District!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago — Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is over ten thousand ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know either. Data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That means when myvi just reaches 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, huge air intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool).
The cost of 1km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice the posture of getting on and off the train, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deaf after getting off (but it's still cool).
The car body is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, I'm afraid it will get knocked when the car next to it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no opponent on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Please do not misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!
More car information that you don't know about can be found in The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Both Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just a few minutes before that day, a million-dollar Porsche 911 and a ten-million-dollar Bugatti Chiron were crashed overseas!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Resonating the spirit of the university with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated over the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which originated in the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and rectifying the society" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying. Higher education is an important "supply side", and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines has not only demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country in advancing from a country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of the world's top-notch in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having certain gaps, to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to be aware that it is impossible for all universities to be the same in building a world-class university. Each school must show its own personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we pay attention to three distinctive features in our education: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment of science and technology integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a system environment of interdisciplinary crossing, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the distinctive features of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production, research and cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence in learning, cultivating virtue, clarity of thought, and practicality", and the common expression system of "embracing rivers and seas, opening up true and profound virtue, leading the people to the future, and building our nation" constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height and condense spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Harboring Rivers and Rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the mentality of "using the world's talents for me", expressing the quality concept of drawing on the world's famous universities to educate people; "Opening True and Thick Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth At the same time, it should also be tempered and tempered by virtue and personality; "Opening the People Before the People" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, research and innovation, and also shows reform and development, and reforming the old and the new; "Tree My Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in the same glory with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the Chinese socialist cause, deeply grasp the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted, there is hope for a nuclear agreement to be reached - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, December 11 (Reporters Gao Wencheng and Wang Shou Bao) Iranian President Rouhani said on the 11th in Tehran, the capital of Iran, that if the United States lifts sanctions against Iran, a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue can be reached with a "good agreement".

As NFTs quickly rose to fame, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to gain stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, and has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
Data from TokenTerminal shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, almost on par with "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" brings a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single roles. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of agency is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway was the choice of track for the enterprise, i.e. the choice of investment target industry. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good future growth potential, considering the best state of the industry in the next 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics lies in "do the things right", that is, do things correctly.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing", that is, do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lies in implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in terms of increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has welcomed several milestone events in 2021.

After seeing my wedding dress photos, I realized that I was also a "photo cheat".
Asian American groups have complained of discrimination in admissions at three Ivy League universities - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Washington May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups submitted appeals to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of US famous universities has doubled, but in these three US famous universities, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions process".
Zhao Yu said that according to the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014, among these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asian-Americans was the lowest relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu told the Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their enrollment policies towards Asian Americans.
So far, the three universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education was not accepted for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups participating in the appeal, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups are also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Jieting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the family of the house owner Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a down payment through the bank on the same day.
Lin Mou signed as the payee on the "Factory Building Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice; both parties agree to sign the factory building purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contractual terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the delay of the signing of the house purchase and sale contract.
Taking into account that the two parties were unable to reach consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry when he had chosen the house, paid the deposit and prepared the payment, but the seller refused to sell it at the last minute.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
After the court's trial, it was found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer's Reminder] Exercise necessary diligence and attention in the course of the transaction.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to be prudent and pay attention to the obligations, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhou Saturday (December 11) issued a statement saying that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is "drawing a line with ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, pretending to be democratic in name and acting against democracy in reality, inciting division and confrontation, and transferring domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale lethal weapon' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted via video, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, Brazil, etc. Some people suspect that the Biden government's real intention is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Schulz also attended the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth polarization becoming increasingly intense." American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to withstand the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "at a time when global democracy and human rights are facing persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The US side has promised to launch a one-year action plan after the Democratic Summit, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.
Richang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
Mint Environment: Standard Service: Quick service My must-order dish is the traditional Mala cake. It's too fragrant, too soft and too delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the Dongjiang inkfish slippery bean curd pot. The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The ink...
Delicious taste, good meat, warm service.
It's been a long time since I came to Rijang, and the fruit lollies are still so delicious & the ingredients are sufficient. The first time I ordered the char siu bao, it was the soft southern texture of the flour that I love!
The braised rice is just the right degree of dryness and the portion is very generous. The signature wax paper chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the kale is also well done.
Tasty, friendly service, good meat.
RICHANG Old Store has been a popular presence for many years, with its small building in Dongdan and wooden floor.
We always have to wait a long time at the entrance to get the claypot rice, and the claypot is cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Richeng. The rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to have a seat available when you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Tastes great, good meat, great staple food.
RICHANG Delivery.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three cups of chicken: there is a bit too much side dish, and a bit too little chicken.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the umami is not salty enough, which highlights the sweetness, everyone can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label Whiskey drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like to taste wine. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal at the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't it be a waste of its smooth flavor?
So how do you drink Red Label whisky?
The editor will give you a brief introduction.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whiskey entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + cola or Sprite or Schweppes and other carbonated drinks became a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding them to drinks can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste.
Red Label Whiskey + Slice of Lemon + Rock Sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Hong Fang Wei has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to individual taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
Education Thinking: How to Make College Exams Fair for "Ace Students" and "Weak Students" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and different levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the test questions are single-type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming before the exam. If they try other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "slackers" can pass the exam without much effort and even get high scores; "nerds" never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores in exams, creating a "strange situation".
From this point of view, the problems reflected by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University in the college entrance examination are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this level of meaning, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, people who have been to university are well aware that it is not uncommon for students to rush to prepare for exams, try various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, strive to get the scope of the exam, and get "key guidance" before the exam. Even during the exam, it is not uncommon to sneak in small copies and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of whether a university exam is qualified or not depends more on the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by teachers, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many major courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be tested in university exams.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is basically composed of basic theories and common knowledge of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university 20 years ago is still being studied and is still the focus."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, there will usually be an examination committee composed of senior subject teachers to compile the test paper, and all the teachers who teach the subject will participate in the marking of the test paper, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But to draw up a set of test questions that meet the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to master the teaching situation comprehensively and analyze the learning level of the students, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of the test questions, which can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the types of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exam, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the student suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out research and course final exam comparison self-examination, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine the score evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
It is an issue that university examination affairs need to face to solve the problem of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will be more in line with reality, so that both "scholars" and "dunces" can get what they deserve.
If you can't change the location of the store for me, can you offer delivery instead?

The colleague's order has been delivered.

Mrs. Jin's Wedding Dress Photography (Nanjie Store) currently has no branches yet.
Before taking the photos, because we hadn't arranged the time properly, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first formal makeup in my life, wow~ I can hardly believe that I could look so good one day, hahaha.
Xiaojie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The outdoor scene was shot in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist would pay attention to our clothes and headgear from time to time, and if there was something wrong, they would immediately help us to fix it.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy after taking photos all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, and we just chose the 24 photos in the package directly, without adding any. (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time as me added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, and I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many.)
The photos were fixed today, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't very good, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
I compared the photos my sister took before and I was really satisfied with our photos. It's simple and fresh, which is exactly the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin's studio to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborns in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, birth certificates could not be issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, the bureau director, Kalu Amunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have already had their information recorded in the system and will be issued with the anti-counterfeit paper when it arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the issue of the Sabah newspaper's printing on recycled paper that had been reported for 10 months by an online media.
He said that the issue had surfaced two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah News was different from that used in other regions, so it was not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kalu Amunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then return to Sabah for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicant in two working days (December 20)."
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to get the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting from more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Junior High in 2016 - Xinhua News
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Middle School Admission Examination for Special Talents was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of enrollment for students with special talents, making the competition for these students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students in the district this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan of the district, and the planned enrollment number is 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students who have special talents in sports, art, and science and who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement of last year, setting 1-2 examination sites in each school district, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and the examination period is divided by hour. The students will enter the examination points in different examination areas and take the examination according to the time period.
On May 23rd, the District Education Enrollment Examination Center publicized the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes?

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel leaving the land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate, and personnel arriving at the land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the exchanges between the two sides are frequent.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, transforming the single line of defense against the spread of the epidemic into two lines of defense, in order to move the checkpoints forward, reduce the risk of the epidemic spreading, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent days, there have been multiple localized cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as insufficient timely local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate implementation of high-risk personnel closed-loop management, formal nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in all links, unstandardized management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that all port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, publish and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and directly-administered cities, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil Tube Video Uncovers the Truth of US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Slaughter - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro documentary on YouTube called "Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US launching the Afghanistan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy. After 20 years of fighting, they have become bloodthirsty, killing innocents and committing various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to launch air strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and establishing killing squads.
For the past 20 years, US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to apply various tortures and personal humiliations to "suspects".
One after another, anti-human crimes arouse more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more anti-terrorism, the more terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a business and preservation perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded area to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many factories of milk powder and got in touch with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, without any difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or you may ask, why is the price difference between bulk and bagged so big?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think expensive is good.
Some consumers even have this mentality that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different after eating it!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reasons for the expensive hearing aids. Where is the expensive part?
Why is the price difference so great when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the bagged pricing is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even no profits, then how can the manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they had a significant increase in the list price to protect their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to promote tinned packaging rather than bag packaging.
Moreover, how does the manufacturer get the millions or even billions of advertising fees every year that you think of?
Everyone can imagine it.
So with the development of society, the promotion expenses of the market, such as the promotion personnel of the shopping mall, the display expenses of the shopping mall, the gift expenses of the product, and the advertising expenses, are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are listening to them, and their prices are also rising continuously. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, use any means necessary to connect with doctors in hospitals and have them assist in product promotion, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans under the premise of having cans at home, which can save money and increase the storage and sealing of milk powder without any impact on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is easily affected by moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it was cold it was dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup was also spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff #PRS_ORG# sent must be cold by now.
I haven't taken it!

Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often can feel the popularity of books related to success studies.
Many of the success books of today promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either work hard to the best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay in the same place.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely correct" by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you must make a firm determination, start anew, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is a self-deception and a futile effort to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, sticks to the rules, and refuses to change.
Most people are timid in front of the word "transformation", reluctant to move forward and unable to make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid representation of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that can enable more ordinary people to take the path to relative success.
The core of the "Second Best Principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
All in all, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it has become more possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will increase.
The path to success that follows the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, while the "best principle" may appear to be a banner of success for all, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?

When will it be delivered?
How can I get in touch?

I can't wait any longer, thank you.

The amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs learned that the latest monitoring results showed that the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 7,100 tons compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Kunyu", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the environment in the spawning areas of the naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, the protection of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources continues to increase year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of “one river, one river, one lake”.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to put it in the bag, it's cold outside.
Could I ask if the takeout is packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or someone took it, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about maternity leave and it was too long.
Give a science popularization to men who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around the age of 50.
Under the premise of good health, it will come once a month regularly.
But it's not regular enough to make accurate predictions, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, it can suddenly come several days earlier.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have a light flow, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; pain can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful forever.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it lasts for several days, 24 hours of bleeding from start to finish. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton strips to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen as soon as the menstrual period begins can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the cramps start won't be of much help.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the period, if you have stomachache for no reason, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
The sanitary cotton swab does not need to be changed frequently, about every five or six hours, or at most eight hours.
Hormonal changes during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the ovulation period may also cause emotional instability due to hormonal changes, which is really unfortunate, as the body trips itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrium.
After the menstrual period ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and a new house (endometrium thickening) is built every month to welcome guests. If the guests don't come, it will be dismantled (menstrual bleeding) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, a few days of 24-hour bleeding every month, plus abdominal and back pain, who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and finds the preparation of a woman's body for childbirth disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime, don't be so ungrateful and don't understand the boundaries. How can they face their own mother with this attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they're really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending the wrong gift is quite disappointing.
Order an extra meal for the kids.
Hope that the store will check the output even in the midst of a hundred busy tasks.
Is the foot bath basin numbness caused by electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bathtub can have a good therapeutic and health care effect. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question and hope it will be helpful to our friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up unexpectedly. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the already popular foot bath tub in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it is suitable for, what material is safe, etc.
Generally speaking, there is no electrical issue with foot baths, but there is no guarantee that some products may not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-type foot bath basin.
Separating water and electricity poses no safety risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily December 10th news (All media reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician Liu Zhonghua of the Chinese Academy of Engineering solemnly introduced: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new energy into the "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea categories taking turns to strengthen their efforts. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving increased income for the majority of tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is rising in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan Red".
At the Xinghua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
New Red Tea adds a touch of red, infusing the connotation of tea culture, with strong popularity and hot transactions, the Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it anymore, as there is no place to park below, he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception by means of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called the Way, the below is called the instrument" in the "Book of Changes • Transmission of the Upper Text", translated by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology and its related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not mention God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and researches human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various different moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior norms people should abide by, applies ethics (the academic of applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from the observed patterns).
It does not start from the expected theory for the examination of ethics, but rather investigates the real moral agent's actual choices made and observed, all the moral factors that lead to this decision, and it studies the ethical views held by the social group.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: The ethical thoughts of humanism, represented by people such as Vala and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empiricist ethics, representative figures: Hume, etc., 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German academic ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Li Kaer, etc., late 19th century, new Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional period ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our relatives, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families and jobs.
It was your noble deed that helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to stop the humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers group, which should have been concluded with a perfect ending long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Association and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Relief funds often fail to reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund", and has been implementing it until now.
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations from the year of June Fourth, from generous individual donations, and are supported by the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a gap of 31 years, the families of the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June 4th.
During this period, China Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called for the suspension of the June 4th donation, considering the donors. We are indeed all retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our thanks to Teacher Ding's "letter to friends".
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those generous and brave comrades who have been persistently donating humanitarian aid funds and taking risks for many years.

[Effect] Photo effect: Took two sets of clothes, overall not bad, like the picture of this set~
[Service] Service details: Because I felt a little uncomfortable when pregnant and doing makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and they kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's comment. Originally I said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep going. We will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all the friends to come here!
There is nothing to complain about from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and can match the makeup suitable for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also top-brand ones.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing together.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing need to be booked half a year in advance. A colleague had a photoshoot in Beijing and the finished product was just so so.
I specially looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not good at managing our facial expressions, and we think this is the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
A team of professional makeup artists, photographers, and post-production designers.
We and the people around us all praised it when it came out.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she was just as delighted after seeing the photos.
I hope such a studio won't be buried, more people can find it and take pictures in their own style, rather than being the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customers like us, we will do our best to complete it. Grateful to meet each other.
A sweet and caring assistant, and a lively and cheerful photography teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and a memorable experience, and the results of the shoot were much better than I expected. Thank you everyone for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for the comment, Xiao Yu. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to know you. I'll come to Qinhuangdao to play again if I have the chance.
How do I pay?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to teach yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, investigate the training institution before making a choice, and it is better to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you didn't introduce your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, profession, age, language to be learned, and even in which city, all of these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one is expensive to learn, and two, it takes a lot of time, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but are willing to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my views. As I don't know your situation, what I said before is only a brief introduction and not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it on the App.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) wall-mounted stove, water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lighting installation, glass cleaning, professional sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thank those who silently give me likes, strive hard for life, life is tiring but we must continue.
Life won't let down anyone who works hard, if you like it, follow me, thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life, others only see the result, while you have to endure the process alone. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back.
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the fatigue is worth it, and there will be a return for the effort!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services help you do "clean" as much as I can, serve the family with love.
Keep every family clean, set up a family governance monument, serve in place, and clean up to the family.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will become dull and dark if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Success comes from doing with sincerity, delicacy shapes delicacy, and we are serious about beauty stitching.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is worthy of trust. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any industry right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persist and work hard, I will be a little better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, all the good starts from the morning. I hope you start a new day with joy, luck, health and good luck. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something to be possessed; when we grow up, happiness becomes a goal to be achieved; when we mature, we find out that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it brings happiness.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: good health and good mood, live happily ever after!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face it actively.
Since we can't avoid it, it's better to face it openly.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face the difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia collaborate to hold the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yu, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, as Art Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Feeling Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibition, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly concerned, some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create, such as Xu Bing in "The Story Behind the Series of Endless Pictures of Streams and Mountains" (2014), using discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Daryl Yeo, CEO of the Biennale Foundation, expressed his hope that this Biennale could establish international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia that is booming, and to strengthen mutual interaction.
Tiana Fei Yu said: "The goals of the Biennial are twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to enable Saudi audiences to be part of the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennial exhibition, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural public welfare posts, to help promote the comprehensive revitalization of the countryside.
According to the relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty-stricken labor force, which plays an important role in helping the impoverished people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly unified the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for rural public welfare posts at the grassroots level, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and positions are set according to the principles of "setting positions according to needs, determining personnel according to positions, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one position per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and require the development departments of each rural public welfare post to purchase commercial accidental injury insurance for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; It is required that relevant departments regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?

Has it been cancelled?
Although the right-wing has had its moments of success in history, they have not lasted long. Therefore, they are short-lived because they flourish in the sun and sweat in the rain; they get a little success and they become arrogant, and they are easily defeated.
But to be realistic, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration, and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes seriously the social problems in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that counter-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm people's livelihood, and political groups will be mixed up, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunities for their own gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with the anti-rebels while refuting the left-wing maniacs, and they were quite angry. I think there's no need for that.
Don't try to reason with traitors or lunatics; they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the rebels and the left-wingers admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels curse you for five cents, when the left madman curses you for the right dog, it proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or they pursue their ideals but become obsessed.
Gradually, the ideal is getting further away, and even the dragon-slaying teenager eventually becomes an evil dragon.
In my opinion, left and right usually refer to constraint and freedom. Due to the innate genetic of Chinese history and culture, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now, the general society hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the competition between China and the US is leaning to the left, which is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
No more words, Flower is so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to US-based companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allies' related companies to blockade China's chip industry at the same time, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the shortage of chips has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies suspending production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are severely affected.
In order to gain control over "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights, restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have been taking frequent actions recently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish the Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing to support US local technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old US technology giant Intel invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened up chip outsourcing business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and may very likely snatch away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-fashioned American technology giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of talents and technical reserves, and will certainly rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou showed no interest in Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the wafer field was due to the grudges between TSMC and Intel that still lingered in his mind from more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world, and was the overlord of the world semiconductor field.
Up until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chips were designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of pressure on small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to give up in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
Focusing on the single link of "wafer processing", Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) does not design, but only provides wafer manufacturing outsourcing services.
At the time, the newly established TSMC was a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it firmly refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
It was unexpected that the giant which looked down on the wafer fabrication service in the past now has to start doing wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer foundry was ironic.
Now the market value of TSMC has surpassed Intel.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally cannot remain stagnant.
Nowadays, TSMC has already sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel still stays at the 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not an easy task.
Don't wait.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some of the weirdest trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February two dragons raise their heads, Haolaiyou price increase, Huolala event, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipate, if secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look no different from the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" previously displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a "solitary peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff".
【Isolated Peak】refers to artificial heating, rapid rush to the hot search list, causing public attention; 【Sawtooth】refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff】refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and is ready to take on new tasks and rush to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is not even a second, which must be a unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen at a glance: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite war, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgment, which stir up emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different points, almost taking into account all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Propagation is a science, setting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of Omicron Rho virus infection - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12th. According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron Rong strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron Rho strain infection on the 10th.
According to Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the nucleic acid test on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation and treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons have turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are all students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they were all mild cases, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over 12 years old entering the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister, Kumbuzo Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had identified its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
The health department of the country conducted genome sequencing on 12 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found 3 cases of infection.

It was introduced by a friend at first because of trust, so I chose to take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of scams.
This is my first time visiting the store, I just showed them my house type diagram. They didn't go to measure the house in person, but they were able to give me a quotation that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000. They roughly showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you get to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this money can never be refunded unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you how much discount.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His offer to me has many problems: 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
In addition to these, their service fee is higher than that of other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, it's the customer's problem and they are completely blameless.
There are many details of various kinds of shirking responsibility, and I don't want to say them all, it's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house they renovated was also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Damn it, they are the same scammers who used to be called Longtou Decoration, now they changed their name to Da Mei, and now it seems like they have closed down again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a crappy decoration company.
In the future, when we make choices, let's do more Baidu searches and consult these consultancies, because renovation is not a small expense.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
All forms of merchant reviews are strictly prohibited. Please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
It's so scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then. If the refund isn't received within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

The starry sky has an appointment | The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian). Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiasts Anjiu photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical popularization, introduced that, just like the New Year's movie, the Gemini meteor shower will appear at the end of the year. Its "screening period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its high and steady flow rate, and together with the Geminids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move slowly, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
A recommendation index chart of the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower of "falling petals" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the excitement will be discounted a bit.
On the 14th, it is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. The moon phase is a full moon, and the bright moonlight will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the late night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast in the suburbs or countryside. Then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to take beautiful 'meteor shower shots', and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential considering stability and sustainability.
Peng reminded to build.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly includes the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TVs are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the users' needs for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, in 2020, the sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for its good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Sazhi Laboratory of China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmologists of Beijing Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison experiment of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser televisions do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in specific aspects.
With more and more attention being paid to visual health, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and the prices are gradually rising with the upgrade of size and light source.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can realize a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required, and the host is small and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generated is lower, the equipment loss is smaller, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and inadequate viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can make your own judgment. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield some ambient light, the use of microstructured Fiehler screens is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
Additionally, I particularly despise projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. Even if you take LCD TVs seriously, it is also diffuse "direct" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it cannot form an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen has been overlooked, and when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that is really uncomfortable.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, which specializes in quality products, does not have any branches yet.
After adding WeChat to book the date, the lady sent me the available time slots, and she replied to my messages in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the studio's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the lady and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with makeup and styling~ The photographer will arrange some props and guide the action before shooting, and pay attention to every detail.
But it might not be the style I wanted because we didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and discuss the post-production style. It feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, just wait and see the results~
I won the photography-themed grand prize in the second event~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He feels a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery - Quality Selection Store - Reply
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
Fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store, then choose the clothes. You can choose wedding dresses. They were very patient when I tried on three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I spent a long time doing makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, they will teach you how to pose for the photo shoot. It just feels like the face is too big in the photo. They said it would take half a month to retouch, but it was sent in three or four days. It feels like there is no difference from the original.
The environment is overall okay.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside is a photography studio.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the poses.
If not satisfied, the photographer will proactively suggest a reshoot.
[Experience] The original double eyelids may have been over-styled and turned into triple eyelids.
Even the eyebrows were shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily life without makeup.
The photos were delivered in ten days, but the photoshopping effect was not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because I wasn't quite sure what style to go for, I tried on two sets, and after much deliberation, I chose the black dress. The saleslady said this set was more of a Hepburn-esque retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The effect was very satisfactory.
After doing my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the process, which was relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected my four favorite ones for retouching. The photographer said he would have the finished product ready within 15 days and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first, and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
According to the conditions set, according to the "Insurance Brokerage Regulatory Regulations (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, initiators have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million yuan to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, one must have the strength, be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating all insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders must have good style. As an insurance broker, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question too much whether Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can achieve.
On this point, it is not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claim party and the insurer are both Hetai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: the products of Internet platforms, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of sales staff, the price-performance ratio of Internet products is generally higher, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the insurance agents: this is especially important, because insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declaration and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being denied compensation.
I have worked as an insurance phone salesperson in "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyu Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the insured, the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and don't know what they bought.
It's like getting 600 million from an insurance company for just one dollar (the world is full of surprises).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning SMS is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - free coverage of 600,000 critical illness amount, which is short-term. If only relying on this, without other commercial insurance, if a serious illness really occurs, 600,000 can't do anything to solve the problem, and life will start to be naked.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, there is no problem with the platform and the product, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster should consider carefully and comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products also have a better cost-performance ratio than Internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and each person has saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am an Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare prices for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody, and let customers be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the policyholder to complete all the insurance procedures by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign either, all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there is no "ceremony" for the purchase of internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" assembly line work, but such insurance purchase will also have a fatal problem, that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to give me compensation?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider left it at the door, and then the person left.
Still wrong
Your rider has already picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but I'm still being told to wait.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
I've finished buying, do you want any other takeout?
What to do
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Alright, if you don't cancel it, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene issues.

Just redeem the discount code.
No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I oppose any form of defamation and insult, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of villain.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me a Facebook friend request, then posting teasing posts, to when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed. I...just let it go.
How did I later receive more friends sending me your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments?
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After the news of my calling the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your identity and status are, in our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, implicit, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are just caring and paying attention to me, you can continue to think that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your making or continue to make all offensive comments.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my looks and figure don't need you to judge.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you doing?
I said yes, but you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's still okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe justice is in everyone's heart.
I have cut out some of the messages for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the post you sent out yourself, right?
I can only say you are a civilized public enemy.
A knowing smile
Vietnam People's Network - Prime Minister of Vietnam Phan Minh Chinh attends the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing topics around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the number of digital technology companies and their revenue in Vietnam still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has cultivated a large number of typical digital products, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform, and to take on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared their mobilization and gathering of resources from all sectors of society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, and various breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery such as Zhu Hui.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the only way for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, digital transformation serves the whole population, so it is necessary to mobilize the whole population to participate.

The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service zone - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have already built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of the sailors and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capabilities have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green integrated service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to ships and crew, helping crew members solve "urgent and anxious" problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life services, production services and government services, taking green environmental protection as the theme and featuring ship repair and ship emergency rescue services. One-time mooring and multiple services for ships in the port will make the work of the crew members who sail on the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and life more convenient.
The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal, the rare visit to Guam, sends an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, on January 9, a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier carrying F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Lincoln also carried its first F-35C squadron, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region also has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shang Pulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo@Nanhai Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, The Strongest Weapon Rarely Visits Guam On January 17, 2022, US Navy Carrier-based Transport Aircraft CMV-22B Flight Route.
According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an uncommon occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness)
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the strongest weapon making a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by an American ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon has rarely visited Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands.
The picture is Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrated the US's capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Raging Thunder" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the "Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", which also includes launch wells for ballistic missiles located on the US mainland, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, the market value evaporating to $251 billion, and Zuckerberg's response of "facing unprecedented competition", what are the reasons?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "Advertising Alliance", many Apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform to realize monetization.
But, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta has around hundreds of employees in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents in Mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but more importantly, on expectations for the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "Metaverse".
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current popularity, it still has a strong sense of crisis. With an annual revenue of between 10 and 20 billion US dollars, it has no strong safety net compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software now have a higher daily activity and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Trying to achieve the unattainable concept of the universe in a short period of time is completely hopeless, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new tracks. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and it is a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
