When I tried to buy an entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price of the orange-colored ones is more than double.
What is different?
I couldn't figure it out after researching, so please tell me.
Now there should only be blue.
If so, there may only be old products left.
Both are the same, even though their appearances are different.
Karate VS Jiu-Jitsu

Jiu-Jitsu
While traditional karate typically only involves sparring with other karate practitioners,
Jiu-Jitsu, particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, involves practicing how to deal with strikes and more.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation by Durandal against Thalia?
Because of genetic incompatibility, Talia and her partner split up and were unable to have a child, so were her genes really that correct?
I think that destiny planning is about getting down to the details, so I think there could be some drawbacks.

After making multiple phone calls again a month later, I was finally able to make an appointment, although it took almost a month for the appointment to arrive, even though I was told it would arrive within two weeks.
Well, I guess it was practice for speaking English on the phone... but it's too hard to understand English on the phone.

With that kind of entertainment available, I don't even feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing and giggling in the background even when nothing particularly funny was being said.
Clearly, it's not funny, but it's creepy that people say "you have to laugh at everything a popular comedian says" as if it's a given.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the comedian's mood, and it won't be pleasant to work with them.
It's like the old black companies, that industry is kind of like an athletic club, and some celebrities have such huge egos that they take on a really unpleasant attitude, so they probably have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work and say "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but even if I'm told that being a comedian is a difficult job and that I have to reach the top of the peak, it's still okay.
It only sounds like justification for one's own career beautification and for comedians having too high a standing in the media and society.
Honestly, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel that it's becoming increasingly difficult to be involved in the entertainment industry.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

Get the hairbrush ready!
Samples are given to purchasers.
The product I ordered from Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my consent.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse but received the wired version instead, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
Although the topic is more about online shopping troubles than building a PC, I can't agree with it no matter how I think about it, so I will write about it here since it is a well-known place.
The starting point was when I discovered that during the Tsutaya Net Shop Tsutaya Day Sale that started from the previous Friday, MSI wireless gaming mice were being sold for 3,280 yen (Linked to Fish Tank).
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Kotobuki link), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order email was received successfully and the shipping email arrived the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in both of these emails and in the purchase history of my page.
From the order to the shipment, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point since there were no miscommunications or cancellation notifications.
The problem started when we received an email a few hours after shipment saying there was a registration error with the product.
According to that email
They were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Refuse delivery and cancel in full.
2. Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose the corresponding response.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note all stated wireless version.
Isn't it unfair that they sent a different product than what was purchased without any understanding and then demand that it be returned for a refund?
In the end, I want to fight back and refuse to accept a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for marriage or a partner, would you not want to associate with someone whose relationship with their family is bad?

Why should I worry in this case?

Bad relationships can also exist between parents and siblings when there are people with different personalities and unreasonable behavior.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside was washed away due to the typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara District in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The Typhoon in East Japan in 2019 had a big impact on the lives of three households with eight people.
Matsumoto Kōro: "At first it was like 'Seriously?'"
"I couldn't believe it was destroyed so quickly. I felt like it was going to be swept away," said one resident. The only road connecting the Kochi-gahara District, the Kochi-gahara Bridge, was swept away by a typhoon in Eastern Japan, leaving 11 households and 30 people in the district isolated.
The residents forced to endure the water cut continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not open to traffic, to transport the necessary supplies.
Matsumoto Kōro said, "Usually I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry something and walk across the iron bridge, so I felt the convenience of having a car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge was completed a month later, but it was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, leaving the area isolated again for a few days until a makeshift bridge was put in place.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Matsumoto Kōro: "I think there are about 10 cases."
For now, I think we should try to secure enough supplies for two to three days. We have tripled the amount of food such as canned goods and cup noodles that can be used for emergency rations compared to before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "Since you never know when a disaster might strike, I felt again that it's better for everyone to have some supplies prepared. On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with the bridge being washed away."
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Tatsuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Department of Yamatsuri Town: "We have established October 12th as Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day and have announced it so that we can think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Are there really parents who would kick their children out?
I don't understand the meaning.
Is there anywhere I can rely on for administrative matters?
I'm sorry, I don't know anything about it, but it seems like there might be some support organizations if I look for them...
As far as I can remember, in Hiro Yuki's videos, people who had trouble getting along with their parents were told to go to organizations that could provide them with food, clothing, and shelter, and that if they went, something could be done for them (I can't remember exactly). So I guess there must be such organizations.
Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.

At the venue, running machines and road bikes were available, and visitors could put on the special equipment and run the virtual Paralympic marathon course reproduced in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, participants' avatars appear and they can experience a marathon-like competition with participants from both inside and outside the country, while also enjoying sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
"It's tough running through the streets of Tokyo, but it's really fun to be able to run and enjoy it, and I'm glad I was able to compete with everyone and make it to the end," said the Tokyo official, who also said they want to make it possible for people to have fun at sports gyms and plan to set them up after the New Year.

Be careful when buying a used home!
The pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system has been successful in promoting used housing transactions.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of owning a house has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large scale", and "tower" have become popular, and this has also affected the sharp decrease in the relatively cheaper newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the market share of existing (used) housing in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, aimed at ensuring the safe and secure transaction of used homes (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property inspection prior to the transaction, which can give the buyer peace of mind.
This can also lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the leadership of the building condition survey is mainly on the seller's side.
In addition, it is important to note that only the announcement of the inspection system is mandatory.
In other words, real estate businesses in charge of intermediation have the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
Turning our eyes overseas, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used car market is thriving, a similar system has already been established, eliminating the risk of seller-led inspections.
Before a real estate purchase, buyers can request a building inspection from experts known as inspectors or building surveyors.
For example, in the US, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of cases involving the sale of a used home, depending on the state.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its characteristics differ greatly from the seller-oriented one.
The sellers will try to show the condition of the building as favorably as possible, and to sell it at the highest price and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyers are carefully examining the survey results and thinking of making the necessary repairs to ensure a safe and comfortable living.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the objectives and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks to be concerned about regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection mandated by the government is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed inspection, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, intermediaries (sellers) who introduce the assigned project can also be considered customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections may be conducted with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

Was Ginza an island?
Five trivia topics you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula.
As proof of that, only in Ginza can you show off your trivia knowledge with phrases like "Did you know...?"
Let's introduce you to some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to share with someone after you learn it.
Let's go up to Ginza!
First infiltration into the Golden Seat
When walking around Ginza, you can find many traces of its history, such as unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As we were walking around Ginza, the sudden silence was broken by her saying, "You know, this used to be a peninsula."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The Ginza, the epitome of the bustling streets that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint where silver coins were made. In 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawamachi", but when it moved to Ginza it became known by its nickname "Ginza".
Incidentally, it is said that the area near Ginza was once a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a peninsula called Edo-mae-shima stretched from Hibiya to Ginza, and a bay extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and advanced the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
Then, the soil that was dug out of the moat and the Kanda mountain were cut down and used to fill in the inlet.
Why not take a look around the area in front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) where there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza City Office, if you are interested?
The "pilgrimage" of Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, Ginza hosts the "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Tour", a pilgrimage known only to those in the know.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, the "Ryūkō Fudōson" is located on the roof of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and the "Ginza Shusse Jizōson" is located on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi's Ginza Terrace.
The Hōtō Inari Shrine and Azuma Inari Shrine, as well as the Toyoiwana Inari Shrine, are located deep in the alley and are not very noticeable, but the Toyoiwana Inari Shrine is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The Seikō Inari Shrine located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachō Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most of the shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
Inari shrines, which have a fox statue at the entrance, were built enthusiastically in many farming areas to pray for the benefits of a stable rice harvest and abundant harvests, known as "Gokoku Horyo".
This eventually led to the belief that large cities like Kyoto and Edo would benefit from prosperous business, and even in Japan's most bustling district, Ginza, faith began to spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve was cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to help the pain go away quickly.
Before treatment, I experience intense pain when I touch my teeth, but will it go away in a few days?
The painkillers didn't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think this is the most painful right now.
Take care.

Let's write about the good things that have happened recently.
Because of Corona, it became fun to stay at home and drink a lot of alcohol without meeting anyone.

Recruitment Script Compilation Method & Existing MOD Script Modification Method
I tried looking at various things and worked hard, but I just couldn't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that purpose so I can start from MO2 without running the script source or resources, but I don't understand how to use the tool.
I went through all the tutorials on CKWiki, but there's only information on how to make a completely original mod.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...?
Addendum
We solved it.
Ultimately, the best option is to reinstall if you're stuck.
During the Pacific War, were most of the soldiers civil servants?
Almost all of them were, not just some, state officials as we would call them now.
Since the military itself is a state organization, those who are drafted through conscription are also treated as state officials in terms of organization.

[Serious question] How did all the foreigners in Japan find work? [Escaping from dispatch]
My friend is currently looking for programming and IT jobs in the Kansai region (currently through temp agencies), but it seems like there aren't many job postings on LinkedIn or other sites for major cities like Osaka *sobs*
How did everyone find work?
It looks like they're really stressed out, so I want to help them somehow...
I'm not sure if it's okay to ask here, but I would be really happy if there was a good suggestion.

A man's body was found near the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS - Yahoo! News).
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Sho-uchi River in Nakashidami, Moriyama-ku and reported it to the 110 emergency number.
The man was rescued from the river, but his death was confirmed at the scene.
The police are urgently confirming the identity and investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disarray in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are quickly confirming identities and investigating the situation at the time.
Will the household tax exemption payment be given in mid-February if there is one non-taxable person in the household?

Posco International of South Korea has acquired Senex Energy of Australia and plans to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News).
Poseidon International announced on the 12th that it had concluded agreements for the acquisition of shares in Senex Energy, an Australian company, and for investments towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the remaining procedures such as the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Senex Energy and the approval of the local corporation, the acquisition procedures are scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hankook Energy decided to invest 49.9%.
Poseco International explained that it decided to make the acquisition this time, seeing that the demand for natural gas is increasing sustainably even in the energy transition era, and blue hydrogen based on natural gas is dividing the market with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Poseidon International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for onshore gas field operations in Australia.

Originally, February 11th was the only national holiday to commemorate the founding of the nation, but now February 23rd has become a holiday because the current emperor was born in February.

Could the pain in your knee be osteoarthritis?
Treatment methods vary depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor's Note: I have been having persistent knee pain recently.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common one for Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial team: Does that mean the joint has become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to cushion shocks and make the movement of the joint smooth.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become misaligned.
As a result, it can cause deformities and inflammation of the joints.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis also affect joints other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Arthritis can also occur in other joints such as the fingers, base of the thumb, neck, lower back, big toe, and hip.
However, the most common case affecting the knee is called "osteoarthritis of the knee joint".
Editorial: So, what is the structure of a joint?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by two bones fitting together in a concave and convex shape.
The part where the two bones meet is covered with articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editor: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making knee movement smoother, which is why.
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Professor Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, right?
However, if this is worn down or distorted, it can deform the joint and cause inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
Although I usually wear pajamas, when my pajamas are in the wash I wear a tracksuit or something to sleep in!
Are there some heavy smokers who can quit smoking, and some who cannot?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance used to be a heavy smoker, but he has completely quit.
He said he just felt like giving up, so he ended up giving up.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series that You Can Experience for Real (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Gambling Manga Series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where life is at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tremble... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
Therefore, this time I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a planning video.
The pachinko "Numa" featured in the gambling-themed manga "Kaiji" is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaiji was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-Step Curtain" set up, and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl aquarium on the building to cause the foundation to sink and tilt, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" featured in Kaiji has been released as a pachinko game and is played by many people.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held by the wealthy as a pastime, Kaiji and other debtors were made to participate in a human horse racing event, the iron beam crossing.
The debtor must proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win the prize, but there are only four steel beams and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, it can be experienced very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
The Eagle Bridge rises to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to seven floors of a building), and from there a steel bridge leads to the SkyBungee and the Victory Bridge, which can be reached by foot.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Corera Kōarashi released a video on his own YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming it was an experience that could be had in Japan, and it became a topic of conversation.
"E-Card" is a two-player card game.
Using 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, the players are divided into two teams: Emperor and Slave.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ear cut off.
After a long and difficult battle, Kaiji eventually realized that his opponent was reading his mind through a device attached to his ear, like an earphone, which sensed and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature. In order to confuse Rinkai-gawa and win the battle, Kaiji shaved his ears to the extreme and altered his body to abnormal values.
The E-Card is commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and other stores.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which gained a lot of attention.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to experience the world view through the game?
Gently pushing forward the first step into the new year, a large "Tora no E-ma" was placed in Yamagata Prefecture's Gokoku Shrine. | Yamagata Shimbun
At the Kenkoku Shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive horse of the Chinese zodiac for next year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared.
On the 11th, a group of Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine, and a ceremony of offering to the gods was held.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to create the original drawings for the ema since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese painting course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Takeshi Suehara, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22) was selected.
The large votive tablet has a width of 3.3 meters and a center height of approximately 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya said he painted an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing people forward as they step into the new year.
Stopping in place, the sight of the tiger looking at the cherry blossom flowers was filled with the wish that "even in a world of drastic change, one can still have the luxury of appreciating the beauty of nature".
Tsuchiya-san's designs are also featured on the emas that are distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonenki said, "I think we can be a helping hand for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano that wants to continue living" - A workshop for four high school students in the city to propose ideas: San-Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center", we will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor.
What makes you happy?
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" while moving around an "island" with each person assigned a theme, using the "World Cafe" method.
Write down each idea on Post-it notes and organize them by sticking them on mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting to live in a town with many young people." "Livability is impossible without transportation such as trains and buses."
Let's discuss further to see if there are any common points.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the coast is attractive," said Tamano Commercial High School third-year student (18).
Binnan High School third-year students (18) noticed not only the local issues but also the charm of the area by talking with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to be surrounded by nature."
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the Mayor and Education Director to make an announcement in February next year.
The president of the center, Higashi-e, said, "We hope to foster a sense of local pride among high school students and provide them with an opportunity to actively participate in community development."

Finding New Ways to Wrap a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
In winter, a scarf is indispensable, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
I sometimes hear people say that they don't quite understand the technique of balancing the hairstyle after winding it, so it is best to look in the mirror while doing it.
When I was hoping for a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, I found something innovative.
The COTORI brand of scarves have a compact size with a length of approximately one meter, shorter than the average size.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wound up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is made from narrow strips of cloth woven together into one piece, and the whole fabric is in a net-like pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edges of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, you can secure it without tying the ends together by winding it.
It's very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be convenient to have a scarf like this.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting!
Get Buck is a movie directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like the Beatles in their full-bodied form, fresh in various ways...
We're on the brink of disbanding so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying his best to keep things in order, he had to deal with Paul, who was annoying with his "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" attitude, George, who was grumbling with a "But still~" attitude, John, who was always late and didn't seem to have much motivation, and Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a "Oh, this is troublesome" face.
Although they didn't hate each other enough to quarrel, there was a very common feeling of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had the same kind of feeling, like a legendary breakdown or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase and gradually building it up to a famous song while asking each other "How about this?" is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
The scene where a subtle humming gradually turns into a zing zing and the lyrics come in is recorded perfectly, it's amazing.
It's rare to be able to see the process of composition in this way, so it's amazing.
Of course, everyone is sweating profusely, so just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
So far I've only seen one episode out of three, but it seems like the biggest cause of the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves, right?
Despite all their complaints, the four of them seemed to enjoy making music, but when it came to finding a place to perform live, the producer and promoter-like people would start talking in a way like "The Beatles are the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that the band members had no control over the situation.
Well, since a documentary also involves the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe Paul supervising it was the reason why there were a lot of scenes where Paul seemed like a villain.

I thought that because you have a serious personality, you have been feeling a sense of responsibility and gradually losing your peace of mind.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I was originally in sales, but I changed jobs due to being very ill. Although I'm not good at initiating sales activities, I thought I was very suited for sales activities requested by customers, so I chose a job in a different industry and it became much easier to work.
Even though I was reminded of what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do in myself, my life will become a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest to gain peace of mind before considering this.
I'm sure you have daily life as well, so if there are organizations such as company unions or industrial doctors, or consultation windows, it may be good to consult them as there may be some kind of system in place.
It would be great if we could live with an easier feeling from now on.

Tornadoes have caused major damage in America due to the influence of unseasonably warm weather and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
It appears that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this time of year had an effect on the atmosphere, making it very unstable and causing cumulonimbus clouds to develop rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest is flowing into the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on both Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air flowing south at around 5500m above the ground, which was unusually warm, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes were occurring one after another in the area.
The southern United States is generally an area prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
During the winter season, the tornado warnings issued in one day reached nearly 150, which was a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes, gusts of wind, and other severe weather events on Friday alone.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that the strength of the tornado was measured by the EF Scale (Modified Fujita Scale), reaching EF3, which is the third strongest out of the six levels, with gusts of wind reaching around 70m/s in an instant.
Further investigations may also reveal the possibility of typhoons with an intensity of EF4 to EF5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is adapted to the condition of Japanese buildings based on the Modified Fujita Scale.
The JEF3 tornado equivalent to the one in the US could also occur in Japan with a high probability, with the potential to collapse wooden houses.

According to the Nikkan Sports, voices calling for help were broadcast live from under the "historic largest" debris of the U.S. tornado (Yahoo! News).
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the US, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
It was reported by U.S. CNN television and other media.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can."
They explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
【Photo】Residents carrying furniture and other household items from damaged houses in Kentucky, which was affected by a tornado. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
The record of the damage range of the tornado is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) which caused damage to Missouri in 1925, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the maximum scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Mayfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that had been operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season also suffered tremendous damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remained.
Trapped under a thick pile of rubble about 1.5 meters deep in the darkness, the woman felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the broadcasted live stream, the sound of "Happy Birthday To You" sung by another woman, seemingly in an attempt to mask her fear, was also heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people compared it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like an earthquake erupting," he recalled.
The police officer from the Mayfield City Police Department said, "We will continue the search until it is no longer necessary."
Despite not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take, they kept up their dedicated rescue efforts.
In Illinois, part of the warehouse of the major online retailer Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The shock of the earthquake was so strong that trains derailed, and highways were blocked due to overturned vehicles.
According to US media, around 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, have been affected by power outages.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be nice if there were "live-in work" options like inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Looking for a part-time or full-time live-in job? Check out Suminavi (Live-in Job Navi) for live-in job listings.

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries base their points on a five-star system, Japan's claim is that three stars should be considered neutral and points should be added or subtracted from there.
At the benchmark point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings of "there are elements that need to be deducted" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we use a 5-star rating system as the standard, then both "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest level in all aspects" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a defect in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used and such operations are being carried out, I understand why you would not want to give 3 stars (bad review).
Therefore, if you try to refute the argument of those who advocate this view with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity from USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump varies depending on the model, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.
The numbers differ greatly.

DIY Radio Coil
I made an AM radio using my own capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but I could also hear a different radio station than the one I was tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right?
Here's the main point, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
What do you think the reason is? Is something like that even possible?

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" offers "fresh fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunchbox "Fried seasonal fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
Hakobune is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes with plenty of vegetables.
Kazuyuki and Yumi Kogetsu, a married couple in their late thirties, opened the restaurant in August last year with the aim of allowing customers to experience the feeling of a restaurant even at home.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Fried fish and shrimp from the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
At the market, choose the best fish available at the time.
"We make the batter with as little breadcrumbs as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be felt directly," says Takayuki, and with shrimp tempura, the light and fluffy texture is immediately recognizable.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the nearby fields' homegrown produce or from local direct sales outlets.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Kiyoshi-san, who has studied French cuisine, adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, the Japanese-Western fusion cuisine offers a familiar and comforting taste, such as rolled omelette, that can be enjoyed by people of all ages (Yumi-san).
The bento "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but there may be occasional shaking (not to the point of feeling dizzy).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's safe because the speed was reduced when there were people around, and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It's painful to feel the gaze of those around me; even though it's good to be seen, it feels like I'm being a nuisance and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It is unfortunate that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could be asked to move to the side.
Specifically, we thought it would be best to create dedicated lanes so that cyclists don't interfere with pedestrians.
I thought it would be a great ride if there were fewer people, since it was relaxed and I could take my time to enjoy the scenery.
It was a vehicle that gave a feeling of anticipation for the near future, such as whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and it was difficult to ride unless you had a strong heart that could endure the pain of the gaze of those around you.
It was so embarrassing.

It may be a bit hard to tell, but this eel rice bowl doesn't have any eel in it.
The answer is "Nasu"! (Tap to reveal the correct answer)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone just eats it with sauce and that the actual eel part doesn't really matter as long as it's cooked properly... but then I realized that the texture and quantity of the eel is actually important.
I didn't want eels to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
The recipe used: Eggplant “Unagi" - Woks of Life (with chili pepper instead of scallions).
This is a simple dish where you steam something and then fry it in a pan with sauce for about 30 minutes.

On the 12th, a man was slashed and escaped on a motorcycle in an attempted murder in Saga City Daizai | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him in connection with an attempted murder.
According to the South Police Station, a 110 call was made by passersby who reported a fight.
The man sustained an injury of approximately 10 centimeters in length and 1 centimeter in depth on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away was medium-built with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the motorcycle.

Families in China's border regions have a long journey ahead of them to establish environmental protection activities (JBpress - Yahoo! News).
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant at Find Asia Hong Kong) China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities conducted by the local government, but also support the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna (also known as Yunnan Province) in Southwest China is one of such regions.
My sister, Li Wanda, is currently active as an actress. Xishuangbanna is an area bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai people who share roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various countries in Southeast Asia, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture covers only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Mr. Li Min-guo in Sisaket, who is engaged in environmental protection activities, and to hear about the content of his activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Ms. Li, our environmental protection activism "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The catalyst for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seesapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts a number of biological diversities.
However, economic development was still lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest was carried out.
He was sent here from Germany to work on the recovery of natural resources and research on biological resources.
And here I met someone I knew through being a journalist, and we got married.
Before that, did Li not have any interest in environmental conservation?
Mr. Lee, I am from Seychelles, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I had to proceed with the project with my husband.
Even though they don't have a well-proportioned face or an unusually tall stature, why do you think some people have an aura about them?
A popular actor said
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out the moment you have self-confidence in yourself.
That person surely has a strong confidence within themselves.

I was just wondering, is it too detailed to compliment someone's outfit or say something like "the colors look nice"?
It's not too detailed, right?
I can see it though.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I've never been told to be specific with praise, so I'm not sure what that means.
What about praising in detail?
What would you do if Yokomine Sakura confessed to you?
"My heart is blooming with joy after Sakura-san's confession. I accept your offer," I replied, and we began our relationship.
And, in order to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one at a later time?

It will be completed in about one week.
We recommend opening a NISA account at the same time, as there are no additional fees, so you can use it whenever you want.

【Omakan / Personal Notes】It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
Until March, due to the lack of playtime and multiple causes of CTD occurring around GW, we had to investigate mainly on holidays, which made it very difficult to identify the cause in a timely manner.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes do not remain in the crash logs.
Main timing of the CTD
All Papyrus and .Net Script Framework logs, as well as logs from .dll plug-ins that leave a trace, will not leave a footprint.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activation with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement * Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
For some NPCs, camera work for kill moves can be improved by turning off kill move settings via .ini files, avoiding setting conflicts between DAR and Nemesis. However, the upper limit is not even close to 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoors) During field movement + partial magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use the Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application setting (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could this be due to additional armor or body mesh shader settings misconfigured for some actors/NPCs? Also, although there may be formatting errors in the 2.0 SPID usage default.ini, the result should be as intended and the pre-requisite Perks should be applied to NPCs.
At first, we focused on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MODs (.dlls) by wearing wet clothes, and this was the result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French level.
In case there are people who have the same CTD problem in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be useful to post it as a reference in case it is helpful.
Everyone was doing it with a tight mental state.
Nobody around notices it, not even colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person looks like they're having a hard time, but they're working hard and staying energetic."
He is probably on the brink of mental exhaustion.
I haven't officially resigned due to mental health reasons, but I think I was at my limit right before resigning.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits-Now that today's visit is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also provide necessary things for medication management (such as one-package system), but more than anything, today's home visit made me realize how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illness.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and we even joked around about it.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, or why she got divorced, and so on - is that okay to do in home visits?
Occasionally, I also cross-dress.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations operated by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that when an occupational therapist comes for visiting nursing, they are given orders from above with an attitude of "This is a medical facility, after all".
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really great because they face me on an equal level and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she's a beautiful person (laughs).
There are those who are receiving mental health home visits from nurses, and those who are considering receiving them.
Home visits by nurses are very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, definitely get it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there were times when I couldn't agree and I had to cancel the contract from my side.
I apologize for my poor writing.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents are one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced its hydrogen economy roadmap.
By 2022, it was planned to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulative) and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price for hydrogen was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The target for the adoption of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the cost of hydrogen per kilogram is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target.
The Japan Association of Economic and Social Research (Zenkeiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on December 12.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the US and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, Keidanren conveyed that "in effect, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are actually in a lower position among the competing countries."
The order of patent rankings by country is China, United States, European Union, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one economy in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
Although South Korea registered 1,033 patents in 2020, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to rank fourth, it only accounted for 22% of China's total of 4,721 patents.
The Japan Business Federation proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax deduction for investment and research and development costs.
It has been a month and a half since I had surgery to cut the muscles in my finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is slightly swollen and when I move my hand, the affected area feels a stinging pain.

Was the ratio of female wives from Meiji to Showa much lower compared to now?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so common that the phrase "sister-in-law wife" is being said around.

Is it a crime for a store to sell items at a higher price than the list price?
Today, the PS5 was being sold for 70,000 yen at the store.
It is lawful.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered lawful for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its scarcity value and not just an increase in value from the original retail price.

As part of the council reform in Takasu, council members' "communication books" are also being created in the style of a TV program: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Takaesu Town Council is undertaking unique council reforms, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council elections are aiming for three consecutive terms without voting in order to get the citizens interested.

US aid weapons and ammunition have arrived in Ukraine, and troops are also engaged in training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that, by December 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The military aid package is worth a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's reinforcement of forces around the Ukrainian border.
The US is strengthening its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, and is also discussing with NATO member countries and drawing up plans for how to respond if Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the provision of weapons assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, US National Guard personnel from Florida were sent in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US Special Forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also indicated that it will impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

We directly question Amano, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission, on the fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that would make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand"!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is called "Advance Gift and Last-Minute Inheritance Technique".
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year, which was a concern, but there is a high possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of succession change?
In a direct interview with former Tax Commission Chairman, Kanemaru Shigeru, he will teach everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques, in order to make it in time for the end of the year and get the most out of your last-minute gifts.
(Edited by the Diamond Editorial Department, Keiaki Miyahara)
From wealthy people to company employees in urban areas, lifetime gifts are seen as a "forbidden hand" and "from the perspective of taxing them in an integrated manner with inheritance tax and gift tax, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer".
The ruling party's announcement of the 2021 fiscal year tax reform outline last year caused a great disturbance among not only the wealthy but also the middle class.
This is because the implication of what is being said is that the rules of succession will be changed, and the "gift before death" which is the orthodox way of dealing with inheritance tax will be prohibited, leading to a large increase in inheritance tax.
The iron rule of tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is "to reduce the taxable property".
Lifetime gifts, which are the strongest trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in one of the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although it was not included in the Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, the policy towards integration was re-established with more detailed wording such as "review the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
In an interview with the editorial staff, former chairman of the Tax System Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party, Masaaki Kanemaru, said.
It is most important to ensure that the tax burden remains the same regardless of when the asset transfer is made, without losing any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration. If the amendment is made at the fastest speed, the remaining chances for lifetime gifts will be reduced to three.
Even without that, it seems likely that in the near future, a big step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax avoidance measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcasted on terrestrial television starting January 10th, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on terrestrial television on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
Starring Kana Yamaya as the heroine, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story of a man and a woman carrying the past, based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Satoshi, serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018.
The protagonist, Kaori, is voiced by Furukawa, and the heroine, Rise, is voiced by Yamatani Kanon.
Riso, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Kairi.
Kei, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but could Kairi be a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yuudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
For those who have not yet seen FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I hope you can gain a deeper understanding of the work by watching Kairi and Rise's complex psychological depictions, their conflicts, and their changes.
I am delighted if even fans of the original can enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

After winning a game with only three passes in the NFL, what were the players feeling and how did they experience it? (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News)
In this game, Jones threw a pass to the Patriots only three times.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bills had an unprecedented genius running back, O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to exceed 2000 yards in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the runs of Simpson and another RB, Jim Brownston.
The biggest reason why the Patriots deployed such extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18m blowing fiercely, and it was snowing before the game.
The Bills, being local, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
Pass 30 times, run 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not a poor performance.
The offense had four red zone entries in ten series and had scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to score 3 points with one field goal in those three attempts.
Goal-line defense in the final minutes of the game.
The Bulls, chasing four points, committed a penalty at 3rd&9, making it 3rd&14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He then threw a pass towards tight end Dorson Knox in the endzone, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs was running a shallow cross to the right side and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen threw two passes targeting the end zone, both of which he missed the two receivers.
The pass on 4th down may have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on 3rd down.
You need to get two first downs in the play.
With two minutes left, Allen's ability to run the ball should have been utilized by going for a 4th and short.

It's time to choose three items that are often kept in the kitchen for a long time and need to be replaced or thrown away (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
Even if you replace it frequently, it is probably not as often as recommended for sponges.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if a kitchen sponge is sterilized in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (even so, it is still recommended to sterilize it in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends exchanging the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when a cutting board begins to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, which is why bacteria can proliferate.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Clean the surface with clean water and either let it air dry or lightly pat it dry with a clean paper towel.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked
Disposing of your favorite mug may be heartbreaking, but the broken surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cutting lips or spilling drinks in the missing part.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Community markets and trade are two different things.
At the community market, we use Steam's payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been victims of scams where they are left with only the item and no money paid.

Trading is a feature that allows players to exchange items or give them as gifts, but does not allow for buying and selling.
Is occupation and employment type a separate topic?
I can't even understand why I would think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees doing manual labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees doing intellectual labor.

I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed on without blinking.
I tried to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS, thinking that it might be corrupted, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end even after an hour.
The possible causes could be that the USB memory tested is too old, or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you overslept and become tired?
Are there any other similar causes?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! I was with an acquaintance.
He always had a baggy-eyed look.
I wasn't disliked or anything.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
I can carry something that is not eye-catching, but I cannot carry something like Louis Vuitton with its iconic monogram and the letters "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to choose something that fits your size.
By the way, I think Japan is good.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why are you talking to me so rudely/in a condescending way?"
If they start to say that it doesn't matter because they are foreigners, it's best to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
I don't think I even dream of having an unpleasant feeling with a moderate probability.
I lived abroad for a while, and the Japanese people who went out there, including me, disliked the Confucian hierarchical customs. There were quite a few people there, and I think they misunderstood that we could say whatever we wanted to the locals.
If it looks like something a Westerner would do, I don't think there's any malicious intent behind it; it's more like a kind of affection or a friendly gesture.
Even with my friends who are from Europe and America, I usually call them by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, there are moments when I'm a bit unsure which one to use.
Well, it's still okay with friends.
It's probably just normal behavior, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say something now.
Could you please speak according to the rules of Japan, since this is Japan?
Study: My white friend who naturalized has a habit of raising his glass higher than the others at drinking parties, even though it's unrelated.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if I do it that way, I won't be treated strangely by people younger or older than me, like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are so attentive to small details (including myself) that it's annoying.

Thank you to the 50 subscribers!
I opened Reddit today and saw that the newly created subreddit had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy!
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, yesterday the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
For those who subscribed to this sub-reddit today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could tell us in the comments section where you found out about this sub-reddit! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Since there is currently only one person creating threads, it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.
It would be encouraging if you could leave comments even without creating a thread.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
People who use Twitter, please be sure to start a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The previous sub-event didn't gather as many people as I had hoped and I was about to give up, but thanks to everyone this time, I think I can keep going without giving up.
We will do our best to maintain the wiki and rules, and make the subreddit easier to use, so please continue to support us!
As expected, there was no snow accumulation.

I only have a limited ability to understand English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of the sentence structure, but I understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I'm just saying this based on how I feel, so it might be a good idea to ask other people too).
I often see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like they are usually well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it is a matter of whether they can reach the point of understanding the subtle nuances of the Japanese language even after studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

It is said that in Demon Slayer, training is the battle.
"Equal exchange of effort" is a human praise <Anime "Yukaku-hen" Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
One of the things that makes the manga Demon Slayer stand out among recent shonen manga is the abundance of training.
Generally speaking, it is conventional wisdom that training arcs, where there is no battle and the protagonist trains day and night, are not popular with readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the two-year training of the Straw Hat Pirates was only touched upon and the rest was glossed over in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE".
Well, one of the attractions of traveling is the eccentricity of the places you visit, but sometimes it's not compatible with "staying in the same place and training".
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began with him kneeling before Tengen Uzui, who had saved his life, and begging for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, to which Tengen said, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are only forced down by the powerful...
While saying that, Yushiro introduced Rin Takanashi, the "mentor" who trains the Demon Slayer Corps' applicants, as a sign of his kindness (though he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
Tanjiro's first contact with RinTaki was when he was asked "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" and RinTaki immediately judged him for taking too long to answer.
Among fans, it's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that has become a popular topic of conversation.
However, walking with a sister who became a demon carries the possibility that a moment will come when a decision is forced upon them.
It can be said that initiation into practice begins with a spiritual attitude.
Rin Takadzukuri orders Tanjiro to take him to Mt. Hagaromo, even though Tanjiro is still an inexperienced novice, and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls such as air holes, stone-throwing machines, and traps, and it seems like you will die before you even start your training.
Even so, their sharp sense of smell allows them to detect the faint scent of traps set by humans, and barely manage to avoid them with their "protagonist correction".
Even so, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba that makes Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so powerful that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is only being able to use the power and skills that have been honed before to their full potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", where those who put in effort are rewarded accordingly and those who do not put in effort are not rewarded, is a humanistic praise that is different from the supernatural power of a demon with no basis, and is a difficult rule that is consistently present in this work.
Is this old?
There is still a sleeping style where you sleep directly on the floor with a mattress and futon spread out.
Because the house is not a condominium.
I do that too.
If you want to make the most of the room, it's better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Is it annoying?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time, but have to work multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "stubbornness".
I think of it as a gambit, where we try to get a greater benefit than the minimal effort we put in.

South Korean Samsung Electronics has established a new "DX Division" integrating home appliances and mobile, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of its Consumer Electronics and Information Technology divisions into a single set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name the division Device eXperience (DX) and will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be seen that the intention is to enhance user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division, which was formed by integrating the CE and IM divisions, consists of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects the company's mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
They also emphasized their intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also formulated to create synergies on a company-wide scale, transcending organizational boundaries, and to build a foundation for differentiated products and services, as reflected in its name.
Already, Samsung Electronics is conceptualizing a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to enable users to freely use content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Is 1500BCE the same as before the Common Era?
What happens when you say it in Japanese?
This was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of BCE in recent years based on the idea that it should be written this way.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

I have someone I want to become friends with.
What can I do to get along better?
Let's call out to each other.
I think it's best to gradually work on becoming friends.
This is Empire of the Undergrowth, right?
I remember it because I supported it on Kickstarter and I was even in the process of localizing it into Japanese.
Although it is a matter of preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I'd like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait, their jaws primed and only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
The larvae of the damselfly always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch their prey, exposing only their circular head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The mantis larvae wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you take any other documentaries into consideration?
Are we looking at it from an ant's perspective?
I wonder?
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular head" would make the part "a giant monster wearing an armor of an ant's scale" disappear, right...?
24-vehicle collision in Aichi, truck driver has no chronic illness, carelessness suspected (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident involving 24 cars in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, had no chronic illness and that the accident was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
Police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer driven by the Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura Suspect had no pre-existing condition and it appears that some carelessness was the cause.
The police are conducting a house search of the relevant parties to investigate the situation in detail at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from Volume 3, will be concluded in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous installment which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this movie focuses on only one battle, packed with new gimmicks!
●"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●The Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started even before the match!
In a nutshell, this four-volume series is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but it is important to note that it is not just a volume that only depicts the matches in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have various activities such as tug-of-war and special training scenes that are quite different from before, but it's not at all boring.
As the tension of the start of the century's war gradually increases in the work, it certainly leads to the excitement of the readers, and I can't help but marvel at the fact that even this period was carefully calculated for the production.
And before the important finals, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Besides the luxuriousness of the match card, what I like is before the match, in the backstage, Ramenman shouting towards the Kinnikuman poster, "It's my turn to be the one to aim now!!"
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, caught the knife and stopped it, and the scene ended with both of them staring at each other in silence before parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is a lot of controversy surrounding Kinnikuman.
Seeing this makes me unable to help but think of their far-off future successes!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now!
The fight between the two ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of fate directed at Kinnikuman!"
It's such a phrase.
This could be seen as a grand statement about the work itself. I think readers of Kinnikuman have been feeling that the protagonist will never lose, and somehow manages to win even without relying on his own strength.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago Sensei had already driven home the point that this option was no longer available.
With this one sentence, the readers thought, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman can defeat Robin with just his strength?"
How?
From another writer's perspective, this is like a self-imposed limitation on the part of the creator, which further stimulates the imagination with its unpredictable development.
Wow, you did an amazing thing!
Without a doubt, I think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend to be Held at Aoba Mountain in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The Winter Illumination, which started on November 26th, is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cypress tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "We were surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find this place."
She said it was very beautiful and it made her feel relieved.
The illuminations, which were first planned to provide a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, are lit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event with button pot serving and movie screenings.
I think that there are only a few people who can read through the documents in order.
My friend who can read really well told me that he was able to do it, but he was slowly solidifying the basics of Linux and rather than reading documents, he was reading from the table of contents of reference books and reading the parts that interested him.
It is better to start with something like Linux rather than something abstract like Docker, as it is easier to understand and can be applied more easily.
It's tough to expect to understand everything at once without taking each step into consideration.
It would be great if we could understand it...
You don't have to do it in order.
Instead of memorizing the content, just vaguely remember the parts you skimmed through before and read them when necessary.

Yonezawa-based Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association will broadcast online delivery and PR of agricultural and livestock products from Yonezawa via Yamagata Shimbun.
On the 11th, the Oki region Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of municipalities and JA, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce," which involves streaming video and selling products online.
The Yamagata Aien Bujotai group made a remote appearance in the first "Nationwide Collaborative Minato (Minaato) Market TV" event planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, delivering the area's attractions along with local specialties.
The "Okitama x Minato Open Port Project", a collaboration between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, was decided to be held, and was broadcasted from the Satoyama Vision House in Yonezawa City Minami-Haranomachi.
Kokuda Mikai, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier", wore a stole from the Yonezawa weaving brand "Nitorto (Nitorito)" and introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
We also delivered the scene of the Iinabe party with the Love Warrior Corps.
At the Tokyo studio, comedian Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and over 300,000 registered YouTubers sampled local sake, wine, Oki beef, and Tsuyahime, among other things.
Viewers praised the broadcast, saying "I can smell it even though it's online!" and "The best with lots of delicious things to go with alcohol!"

This morning, an unfortunate event occurred...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6℃).
So we decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Do not start up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp will light up for a moment and the fan will start to move but will soon stop.
After that, he said nothing.
Even when unplugging the power plug and trying again, the light only blinks for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and the ATX 20-pin and 4-pin connectors and removing all other parts, the system still won't boot.
5.) I have heard a buzzing sound like something is hitting the fan of the PSU before, so I am suspicious that the PSU might be the cause.
I'll try to find an ATX power supply that's left over and give it a try the day after tomorrow.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work...What should I do?
Should I change the case and motherboard together?

Even when you feel like there's nothing you can do about it, don't you think there are still people who use self-deprecating language?
On the contrary, those who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are extremely rare.
I want you to maintain that style.

How do you dispose of PCs and peripheral devices?
PC Firm
I've brought it in once, but the Saitama Prefecture won't collect it for free even though it's in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture.
Relatively new ones are free.

I haven't used it before, but it seems like Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear the reviews.
Coarse waste (paid) and additional information> Collection boxes of the local government (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it second-hand.
Additionally, you can use Mercari and Hard Off.
Are there people who sell used PCs at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
Selling while it is still worth money may also be a wise choice.

Broken printers and old UPSs that no one will take have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's being put off for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, banknotes can be exchanged but coins cannot be exchanged.
Since commemorative coins contain gold, they have value.
Even though they haven't done anything wrong, there are times when you can't help but dislike them, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes because we are human.
"There are people who dislike (someone for no reason)," that's what it's like to dislike someone.

Don't you feel discriminated against because you don't have a girlfriend?
It's not about the face, it's about the heart.
But it's sad that people are judged by their appearance.
Because the inner self cannot be shown.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduation?
I usually wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, she was wearing pajamas, haha.
Is it possible for someone to become a Riajuu at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
Though all sexual desire and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.
The men's volleyball team has advanced to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / The men's fencing team's Freel finished in 4th place and did not win a medal.
The Japanese men's volleyball team, Ryūjin Nippon, has advanced to the final 8 for the first time in 29 years! Coach Nakagaki: "It was a big goal."
When he lost the third set in the Referee Challenge x2, he thought it was over, but he won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
I think the opponent in the semi-finals was in a different class, so why is that opponent in the third-place match?
I would like to plant a tree that will provide privacy in the garden, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
Ideally, I would like a evergreen tree that is easy to care for and preferably produces fruit.
Thank you in advance.
To get fruit from a fig tree, it is best to plant other fruit-bearing trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby, as this will help the fig tree to bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to have between us in order to live together without any financial difficulty?
Everyone is different.
Where you live and how the relationship works out depends on the situation.
It would be better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of parting.
It is best to have a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal services, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation has no benefits.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a Legend Rare, but it was a re-recording of a Legend Rare (^_^;)
Is there any kind of card game like Gambling that can be used as a hobby?
I think yes.
