At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students sang the main role and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Network
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of creative academic achievements were honored, such as using air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for the source of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone, which is only half the size of the smartphone.
"You just need to take a breath and this instrument can preliminarily detect your body health condition from the gas components of your breath."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lights: High-powered eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new perspective on the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
Many diseases are not detected or removed in time, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room.
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in the early stage of cancer detection, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgery, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and looking cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qi Zhang and his classmates invented a set of "air hand-washing devices".
As soon as we stand on the apparatus washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like an inflatable pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean!"
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange for me to receive a replacement as soon as possible, thx.

No problem, thank you.
A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when sudden events occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really suffer from a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes to save our lives, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
In China, official data shows that every year three million people die from accidents, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest.
On average, 15% of those in the US can be saved.
At the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founding member of First Reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person.
I find that few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing an emergency situation.
Maybe it can even save a person's life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turn 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was also something I did a few months ago, and I'm glad to say I achieved it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
For 13 yuan, there's only one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried it.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
Does one cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver the food, and this time I only got one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally think Four Seas is an all-around bad movie in every sense.
But you can't say that this movie doesn't have any highlights either, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching, Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creature from a crime novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may suspect that there are metaphors implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you will find that it is actually a pile of crap.
First, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad were very reassured about it.
And then the elderly person was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why are the island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a stretch of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the driver could not be found around.
The prop feels too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and suspected of criminal activity become a police auxiliary?
Faced with usury, why didn't they report to the police? In the movie, the police even asked if there was any difficulty.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the film, and it is so outlandish that I feel pain when I recall it.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, it's just an abominable patchwork.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep doubt of yourself, why did you go to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays.
For most people, they are also familiar with the tropes of various movies, such as if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, it would be inspirational and comedic, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually moves towards success.
If you want to make a romance movie, you can tell a story about a small town young man who loves to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl and their complicated relationship.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
For example, the character Yoon Jeong plays (the one whose new motorcycle was burned but still can sing), cannot explore ideas that even Kennedy couldn't withstand.
As for the female lead, who is obviously not mentally challenged but can act like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to her acting or the director's requirement.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to add trouble to the audience?

Inspect the concrete module production and processing equipment. Introduction to Zhengzhou Well Wall Brick Module Equipment:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well wall wall module machinery in China, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, the company now has high-quality products, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspect the concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Check the production and processing equipment of the concrete well module, the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin's inspection well brick-laying machine equipment is widely applicable to the new masonry materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example: various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have grooved structures on the top, bottom, left and right sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear strength of the well wall is far superior to that of the flat-friction masonry form.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being assembled, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are penetrated. After pouring the core, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Both the horizontal and vertical modules are equipped with grooves for inserting reinforcing bars, and the horizontal lapping reinforcing bars and vertical inserting reinforcing bars correspondingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage, etc. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display to monitor the mechanical operation of the entire process, realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic transmission and double cylinder hydraulic transmission.
An independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box advances the model box demoulding and rising, the storage box door closes, the automatic conveying pallet, all completed independently by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce the mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing parts and hydraulic parts, ensuring the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table surface line cutting and molding without welding points make the filler box free to swing and guide, which can effectively reduce mechanical wear.
Reduce the load of the mold, fill and integrate the two-in-one compression amplitude, adopt integration, full synchronization, table vibration, and mold vibration to ensure the vibration solid effect.
The mechanical vibration machine of the well wall wall module, computer automatic control amplitude, adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance of the raw material, no wear and tear braking, so as to prolong the service life and reduce the cost.
The wall module machine has both automatic and manual control functions.

Chongqing Vocational Schools are piloting the modern apprenticeship system, where students are considered quasi-employees of the enterprise upon enrollment - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools, and students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, a tripartite agreement shall be signed by apprentices, schools and enterprises. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific posts, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with partner enterprises to carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for corporate employees.
The pilot schools will reform the talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise jointly design a talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training period as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program, and on-the-job training is generally 6 months.
Enterprises should implement an enterprise team-based management model. According to the characteristics of different specialties, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each rotating post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having about 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Following the principle of piloting first and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, and enhance the employment rate and quality of students.

I have considered this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally made the tough decision. The suction effect is good, and the dust in the house is obviously much less. However, it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand; the wet mop needs to be improved, as there will be dust marks when it is pulled back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied.
The food processor is quite heavy and looks high-end, suitable for me as a kitchen novice. My child said it tastes better than what I cooked myself. I have cooked two dishes with meat and two dishes with vegetables, and the sweet and sour pork ribs are especially delicious. It takes a bit longer for some dishes, but the others are very quick. The noise is very small, so I don't have to worry about burning the food or not knowing how to cook!
I received the goods and couldn't wait to fry three dishes at noon. It really changed my life. The control of the temperature and seasoning was accurate, and the taste of the dish was directly upgraded to the chef level. It's good. For those who are not good at cooking, it is a magical tool. I recommend buying it!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Smart cooking machines, the kind that automatically regulate heat and automatically stir-fry.
No more fear of being scalded by hot oil, no more fear of controlling the heat badly and burning the food or undercooking it.
The stir-fried dishes are much tastier than what I made, the tomato and egg stir-fry is especially flavorful, and the eggs have a great texture.

South African doctors: Omics transmissibility is strong, but mostly mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician organization of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more vulnerable to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the last Delta outbreak, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will need to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Omnicron variant in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak cases in South Africa, the mortality rate was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data and other reports from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It is still in the early stage, and we need to get later stage data.
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only had two weeks to enter this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rate, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delta still being the main coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of Omeka are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Haoden Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Commentary: What can be done to rescue abducted children?
If we use the famous public welfare advertisement "No buying and selling, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for abduction, collective prevention and control, and the whole people against abduction, make the abduction behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing that the App Name is "Reunion", I felt a warm sense of comfort.
New technological means not only have a name of "artistic" and full of feelings, but also are properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of enforcing the law against child abduction is to locate the abducted children and protect their safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed in many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before a trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Weighing the importance of the matter, under the urgent purpose of "rescue", topics with much debate and controversy such as "whether child trafficking should be punished by death penalty" can be put aside for careful discussion; however, the rescue of trafficked children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
Every minute of delay in the search for abducted children could mean that the child is one step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases by one point.
In this situation, taking effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, combating human trafficking is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
To combat crime and protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to societies.
For example, a common case is when a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest and placing the children under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the buyers of abducted children should also be monitored and punished.
An individual illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
With the trend of "leniency" in sentencing, the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to a more serious crime with a high starting point and a maximum penalty.
Yet, there are still a significant number of trafficking cases occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and lack legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" of human trafficking is widely present, traffickers will be driven by their greed and constantly innovate their means of trafficking, forming a "struggle of law" situation with law enforcement, and the anti-trafficking action will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong elaborated on the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session from three aspects: ideals, beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and Party leadership and Party theory, combining his own insights and personal experiences in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the plenary session and the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, integrate and apply what we have learned, strengthen our ideological, political, and action awareness of upholding the "two establishements" and achieving the "two safeguards", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to firmly follow the Party, and to use their youth to write responsibility and commitment.

Actually, I don't know if it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Tracing is not possible.
I hope you understand.
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than what was displayed.
No more, thank you.
Yes, a new delivery rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be efficient in handling.
Waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olive fruits and filtering out impurities.
It can be divided into three levels according to the different acidity.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: It has an acceptable taste and flavor, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or known as "second-grade oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent with a light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil extracted from the pomace by dissolution and then refined.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be known that olives, just like grapes used for making wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, producing olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow crops sporadically in suitable areas.
The main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and even countries far south of the equator such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, have similar climates.
The harvesting month for olives:
From March to June every year, it is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for fruit picking (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded, with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people around the world and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that plans are in place to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs committee member Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"Dictatorships can never extinguish the spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the rails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship, and those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democracy Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening remarks on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must cooperate.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threats of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you have not recognized the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason we must change."
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, issued a "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of resistance to autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down false information to win the battle.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken and uploaded the photos to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally it was #NUMBER#.
In any case, I won't be calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver it?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company.
I don't want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
We waited for a meal for half an hour.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hi, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a price that's not too high to practice with first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level cameras" are actually industrial garbage.
They have low strength, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, the hard ball can't bear it, and skilled players find it difficult to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so hard, they know you can't learn it, they also know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so they make a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to me to buy the expensive ones then, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly used racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not well-known, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one for 500 or 600 yuan is good enough, and a used one for 200 yuan. Isn't it great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket?
It is friendly to newbies, but it becomes useless after the novice stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I ignore the original one?
Hi, we ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the sesame chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# unexpectedly asked me to take it away, please cancel it.
My order requires delivery, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

Actually, there are many considerations for matching clothes for girls who are slightly overweight.
Girls with a bigger body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
Wearing clothes that are too long can give a feeling of being short and chubby.
If you divide your outfit into top, middle, and bottom, you will naturally appear taller. For example, wearing different colors for your top, skirt, and long socks will create a slimming effect.
In fact, many dark colors of clothes are the standard for slightly overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover your body fat, and elegant and noble black skirts are also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popularized, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
Girls who are slightly overweight should definitely learn the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black thigh-high socks or fishnet stockings (the kind with thin grids). Choose a soft floral trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the shortcomings of a plus-size girl.
Of course, slightly overweight girls also have their own standards when it comes to wearing short skirts.
For plus-size girls wearing a short skirt, it is recommended to choose a top in the same color as the skirt, which will make your plump figure look taller.
Pairing a mini skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN fashion combination for summer!
If you are top-heavy but have slim legs, we recommend choosing a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show off your advantages.
A-line skirts will look slimming, especially for plus-size girls. Choose tighter tops to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can be tried by plus-sized women.
Girls who are slightly overweight can also look fashionable.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in dressing, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of slightly overweight girls earlier😄

The girl acted as a target for her sister to raise donations: "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a "target" to raise money for her sister went viral on social media.
The photo shows that a girl was standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan a arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by could pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot.
The behavior has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xicheng Branch, confirmed to a Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had taken such extreme action in order to raise money for her sister, but such behavior was not to be encouraged. After admonishment, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned for collecting donations on the street.
In the circulated picture, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat and Alipay accounts.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is a "begging behavior for attention", while many others express sympathy.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
When the police officers from the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site were interviewed by the local media, they said that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone for help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising donations for her elder sister Jijiayan.
But since the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, they had no better way to raise funds and resorted to this behavior.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were involved, one as the target and one as the assistant, but neither of them actually shot the arrows. No one was found shooting arrows during the process, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police investigation, the security department determined that the bow and arrow used did not fall under the category of controlled items.
The responsible person stated that "fundraising through gaining attention is not encouraged."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the station.

I started using Acer Nitro Knight two years ago and it has been a great value for money with its excellent quality.
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
I have already purchased three machines from this series!
It has a beautiful appearance and good configuration.
I wanted to wait for the 418 bank promotion to buy something for my nephew, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
The price-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back and review it after a while.

What will be the hottest thing in 2021?
No doubt it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a very popular article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for the Gold Medal in the Olympics". It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
This seemingly humorous article also reveals the daily struggles of project managers, representing the current lack of effort in project management work.
People engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of applicants for PMP (Project Management Professional international certification) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of people who applied for PMP® in China was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 holding valid certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing working environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on and on; unclear division of labor among members, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, poor communication between departments, and difficulty in advancing the project...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of R&D key talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base".

This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
Words are not enough, let's take a look at what other students say about the course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtianhua experts team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

On the one hand, this consumer craze makes people marvel at the increasing national consumption power, on the other hand, we have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the youth is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jexin has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to promote the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, CSC Credit has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities and launching innovative practice competitions, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, Jexin reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the consumer loan misunderstanding, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When spending, it is important to plan ahead and be mindful of your budget, and make sure to pay back on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car or buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour included Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
Tensions in diplomacy have severely affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the effort to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states condemned as unable to solve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to slowing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the GCC unity and to propose measures for its member states to fully cooperate in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good.
It is said to have the loudest exhaust sound of all supercars in New Town!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know either. Data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That means when myvi just reaches 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge air intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, it's really uncomfortable (but kind of cool)!
Fuel money for 1km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice getting on and off the vehicle, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deaf after getting off (but it's still cool).
The body of the car is too big, it will be too narrow to park in an ordinary parking space, I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next to it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road. (This is unrelated to the driver, haha!)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!

Involving an accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just a few minutes before that day, a million dollar Porsche 911 and a ten million dollar Bugatti Chiron were crashed overseas!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News.
The so-called University Spirit refers to a series of educational philosophies and value pursuits that have been accumulated over the long-term development of a university, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious, the global competition in education, technology and talents is intensifying, and higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines, not only does it demonstrate the confidence and determination of our country in transitioning from a higher education power to a higher education strong country, but it also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of the world's top-notch in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having certain gaps, to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It should be especially noted that the construction of world-class universities cannot be the same for all schools, and each school must show its own characteristics and features while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment of each school.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to three distinctive aspects in running the school: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment of science and technology integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University-Industry-Research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the university spirit and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Cultivation, Discernment, and Practicality", and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit of "Incorporating rivers and seas, opening up true and profound virtue, leading the people to the future, and building our nation" constitute the core of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "embracing rivers and seas" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", and embodying the high-quality concept of education from world-renowned universities; "seeking truth and cultivating virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and being good, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also cultivating moral character and personality; "reforming and innovating" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, but also reform and development, and breaking with the old and ushering in the new; "building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share weal and woe with the nation's destiny.
These spiritual concepts and values are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the era of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common human ideal.

As NFTs quickly gained popularity, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to gain stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a transaction volume of over 3 billion US dollars to date.
Data from TokenTerminal showed that Axie Infinity had daily revenue of more than 8.2 million US dollars, rivaling that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially reported that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single characters. In addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway is the selection of the industry for investment, that is, the selection of the target industry. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good growth potential in the future, considering the industry with the best growth potential in the future 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the industry development stage, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on for the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics lies in "do the things right", which is to do things correctly.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing", that is, do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lies in implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on top of increasing customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); on top of increasing customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has welcomed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been recognized as a legal currency by a nation or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of the Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.

The most important thing for shooting wedding photos is that both the photographer and the makeup artist have aesthetic taste, luckily I met them.
After seeing my wedding dress photos, I realized that I could be photogenic too.
Asian American groups have complained of discrimination in admissions at three Ivy League universities - Xinhua News Agency.
On May 23, Xinhua News Agency reported from Washington (reporter Xu Jianmei) that more than 130 Asian American groups submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American famous universities has doubled, but in these three American famous universities, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian applicants" in their so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu-Kong introduced that according to the research of Sanders et al. in 2014, Asian students had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants at the three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and Department of Justice could launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans after determining the facts.
They also expect the complaining universities to take the initiative to address this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education declined to take action on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups participating in the appeal, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups are also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhanting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the family of the house owner, Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the delay of signing the real estate contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally finding a house he liked and paying the deposit, Mr. Lu had the money ready to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell, leaving him feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After the court's examination, it was found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and the failure could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the breach of contract liability.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind us to exercise necessary caution and attention in the course of transactions.
When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) saying that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, acting against democracy in the name of democracy, stirring up division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the US has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'mass destructive weapon' used by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been voices of questioning both internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticism of the invited leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organizing the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Schröder also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming increasingly severe. The US democracy is a 'rich man's game' built on a capital base."
President Biden stated in his speech, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be a buffer and force against authoritarianism, and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "at a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. has committed to launching a year-long initiative following the Democracy Summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The US hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democracy summit at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send it to the wrong address.
Ri Chang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Ambience: Average [Service Bell] Service: Food served quickly. My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Cake". The Mala Cake is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the cuttlefish is very chewy.
Tasty, good meat, friendly service.
It's been a while since I last came to Richeng, and the fruit lao is still so delicious & the ingredients are plentiful. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time and it was just the kind of soft flour texture I love from the south!
The braised rice was cooked to the perfect degree of dryness and the portion was very generous. The signature wax paper chicken wings were as good as ever, the soup was also good, and the kale was also handled well.
Tasty, friendly service, good meat.
Ri Chang Old Store was a popular spot many years ago, located in the Dongdan Building with wooden flooring.
We always have to wait a long time at the entrance to get the claypot rice, and the claypot is cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Richeng. The rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to have a seat available when you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Tastes great, good meat, great staple food.
RiChang Delivery.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three Cup Chicken: There was a bit too much side dish and a bit too little chicken.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the underlying salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness. Everyone can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the drinking method for Red Label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would be a waste of its rich flavor.
So how do you drink Johnnie Walker Red Label?
The Editor will give everyone a brief introduction.
How to Drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The taste is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoked malt flavor.
The wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice, or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red Label whisky has entered the Chinese market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky mixed with cola, sprite, or Fanta has become a timelessly fashionable drink.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding them to drinks can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste.
Red whiskey + sliced lemon + rock sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Martini has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How to Make College Exams Fair for Both "Ace Students" and "Average Students" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are too monotonous and repetitive, and the questions are too simple, it will certainly create a completely different feeling.
Students who do not put in effort may be able to pass the exam with a last-minute cram session. If they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "underachievers" can pass the exams without much effort and even get high scores; "overachievers" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores in exams, create a "strange situation".
It appears that the problems reflected by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University in university exams are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, those who have been to university know that cramming, trying various ways to "obtain" exam questions from teachers, striving to define the scope of the exam, and seeking "special guidance" before the exam are not uncommon, and even bringing cheat sheets into the exam and begging for leniency from the teacher after the exam are not unheard of.
In my opinion, as an assessment of teaching quality, measuring the qualification of a university exam is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by teachers, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage of college, majors begin to specialize, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge points of a subject comprehensively is the content that university exams will examine.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is basically composed of basic theories and common knowledge of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics that was learned 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a priority."
However, the fact that the knowledge points remain the same does not mean that the exam questions are single-type and repetitive.
In many universities, the exam is usually composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate to compose the test paper. The exam marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that it can overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions in the exam, which can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability assessment, and at the same time, innovate the design of question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of examination, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the student suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
It is required that teaching units organize teachers to carry out discussions and course final exams for self-inspection, formulate test paper composition and related regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of test paper composition and review links, refine grade assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single types of questions and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examinations need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the real effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the student learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both sides, teachers and students will be better connected and form positive interaction. Examinations will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both academic elites and academic underachievers to get what they deserve.
If you cannot change the location of the branch for me, can you change it to delivery?
Do I not need to give more money then?
The colleague's order has been delivered.
I can't pull it off.
Where is the GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Jin's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) currently has no branches.
Before the photoshoot, we had to change the time twice due to our poor time management, but Lanlan, the consultant, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first time putting on makeup properly, wow~ I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The outdoor shoot was taken at Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. During the shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix it if there was something wrong.
The photographer is also very humorous, and they feel happy after a day of taking pictures.
When selecting photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were selecting photos, there was really no intention to add any photos, just the 24 in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't quite right, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
When I flipped through the photos my sister took before and compared them, I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Mrs. Xuanhan Jin for wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, Celso Amorim, the director of the bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will receive their anti-fraud paper when it arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the reports of a local media outlet that Sabah newspaper printing had been delayed for 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing the special security paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah News was different from that used in other regions, so it was not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kalamunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The agency will send personnel to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week, and immediately return to Sabah for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicants in two working days (December 20).
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to get the birth registration paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
They had been waiting since more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Middle School in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd of the month, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission will organize unified examinations for middle school admissions of special talent students.
This year, all districts of Beijing have compressed the proportion of enrollment for special talents, making the competition for special talents even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students with special talents in sports, art, and science who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to take the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement of last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, a total of 13 examination sites.
Examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and time periods are divided by hours. Students will enter the examination points in different examination areas and take the examination according to the time period.
On May 23rd, the district education enrollment examination center announced the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes?
Food not received.
The key is that I haven't had dinner tonight.
If it can't be delivered, can you say it earlier?

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities can study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
A relevant official from the Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar and people on both sides of the border frequently travel back and forth.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, change from one line of defense to two lines of defense, and move the checkpoint forward, compress the risk of epidemic spread, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate and untimely epidemic monitoring and warning in some places, failure to implement the closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, routine nucleic acid testing being merely formal, inadequate disinfection of cold-chain items in each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job of prevention and control without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and directly-administered cities, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube Video Exposes the Truth of US Military's Bloodthirsty Slaughter for 20 Years - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube titled "Killing Machines" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the past 20 years of bloodshed and killing of the innocent.
Misusing drones to launch airstrikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and forming killing squads.
For the past 20 years, US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects".
The atrocities stirred up even more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more terrorizing".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a business and preservation perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded area to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many factories of milk powder and got in touch with many production lines of milk powder.
Actually, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone is sure to ask: why is the shelf life of bagged coffee one year, while the shelf life of canned coffee is two years or longer?
Or one may ask, why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged?
Actually, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, with this mentality, say that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different after eating it!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reasons for the expensive hearing aids. Where is the expensive part?
Why is the price difference so big if their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the packaged prices are too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by manufacturers are very low, or even no profits. So how can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in the pricing of their products to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote canned rice rather than bagged rice.
Moreover, you think so many manufacturers' annual advertising expenses are tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine it.
So with the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as promotional personnel in the mall, display expenses, product gifts expenses, advertising expenses, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, especially audio equipment, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to gain higher profits, in fact the increase in their raw material costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Additionally, some brands, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary and collaborate with doctors in hospitals, having them assist in the promotion of the products, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is taking advantage of consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in a can at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any effect on the children.
Don't assume that the shelf life of tinned products is longer than that of bagged products. If the shelf life of tinned and bagged products is the same after opening, it just means that bagged products are not easy to store and are prone to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late and the food was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup also spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the things #PRS_ORG# sent must have gone cold.
I didn't take it!
No Name said nobody went to get it.
We called them.
If you don't refund me, I will call the police.
I have used #PRS_ORG# multiple times, but today's experience was the worst.
Absolutely unacceptable.
Okay, no problem.
But restaurants and delivery riders should also be reminded.
Prevent it from happening again.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time is constantly being delayed.
I don't know until what time I have to wait.
If I cancel the order, can I get a refund of the money?
How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
A rider was confirmed more than an hour ago.
No longer willing to wait
Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of books on success.
Many of the success books today promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, we have skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either do your best with all your might, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay in the same place.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180 degree change", which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is undoubtedly a self-deception and a futile effort to shout "you need to change" in the ear of someone who adheres to the rules, follows the old, and refuses to change.
Most people are timid in front of the word "transformation", reluctant to move forward and unable to make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "From Tomorrow Onwards" is the most vivid representation of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that can lead more ordinary people to the path of relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a great victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In conclusion, it is always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it has become possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will increase.
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner of success for all, but in reality it only motivates a few; whereas the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserve increased by 7,100 tons this year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the amount at the beginning of the protection in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Kangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the environment in the spawning areas of the naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Naked Carp from Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the protection efforts are continuously increasing through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, and the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I need to put everything in, as it's cold outside.
Can I ask if the takeout is packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Want to know if it was missed or someone took it away, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still has not been delivered.
I just saw an article about menstruation and it was too long.
Give some popular science to the males who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of good health, it will come once a month regularly.
But it's not so regular that it can be accurately predicted. There is a tolerance of about one week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, it can suddenly come several days earlier.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; menstrual cramps can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
Menstrual flow cannot be controlled and it can last for several days, 24 hours a day. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the menstrual cramps start won't be of much help.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the time of your period, and you have an unexplained stomachache, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Sanitary pads do not need to be changed often; it is enough to change them once every five or six hours, at most eight hours.
Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual period can make you more irritable, and the emotional instability during ovulation due to hormone changes can be quite unfortunate, making it difficult for your body to keep up.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrium.
After menstruation ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month it builds a house (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If the guests don't come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; for decades, it involves bleeding for a few days every month, as well as abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother has had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty and shameful, so everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a woman's body for the creation of life is disgusting, it should not be said in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like this anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime, don't be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude and how can they think of their own children?
Finally, sisters, try sanitary pads, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending the wrong gifts is quite disappointing.
Order additional food for the children.
We hope that the store will check the products even in the midst of their busy work.
Does the foot bath basin feel numb when taking a foot bath due to electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good effect on foot massage and health care. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question and hope it will be helpful to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking your feet in electrified water is really too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the pen and it lit up. To his surprise, Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, whose attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the highest temperature setting, which people it is suitable for, and what materials guarantee safety for this foot bath that has been popular for a long time.
Generally, foot baths do not have any electrical charge issues, but there is a possibility that some products may not have been strictly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-type foot bath tub.
Separating water and electricity poses no safety risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test it.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily reported on December 10th (Reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held this morning at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: The source of Hunan Red is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum for the "Five-Colored Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen their efforts. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving increased income for the majority of tea farmers.
The tide turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea industry experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan Red".
At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called “Bingli Chun” and immediately placed an order.
Secretary Wang Zhun of the Provincial Tea Association said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to a certain extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xinhua Red Tea, with its red hue, embodies the cultural connotations of tea. Popular and in high demand, Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, as there is no parking below, he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called Tao, the below is called instrument" in the "Book of Changes • Transmission of the Upper Classics", translated by Japanese Inoue Tetsujirō (Meiji era).
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology and its related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only a concept".
Metaphysical Naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not mention God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior standards people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, and summarizing from observed patterns).
It does not start from the preconceived theory of ethics, but rather investigates the actual moral agents' real choices made and observed, and all the moral factors that lead to these choices. It studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by people such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empirical Ethics, representative figures: Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, representative figures: Li Kaer, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transition Period Ethics (Irrationalist Ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our relatives, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families and jobs.
It is your noble deed that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease humanitarian donations to our difficult family, the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief activity should have been finished long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Fraternity Council of the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Funds for relief often fail to reach the hands of the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, following Mr. Ding's suggestion, the "Tiananmen Mothers" established a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund" and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Household Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from campuses and society on June 4th, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the June 4th donation out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude to Teacher Ding's "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those generous and brave comrades who have been persistently donating humanitarian aid funds and taking risks for many years.

[Effect] Photo Effect: I took two sets of clothes and the overall effect was quite good, I particularly like this set of pictures~
[Service] Service Details: Because I was pregnant and felt a bit uncomfortable during makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the feedback, Rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going forward, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, it is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and can match the makeup suitable for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also top-brand ones.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague had a photoshoot in Beijing and the final product was just so so.
We specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, which is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the naturally wonderful moments.
A well-crafted team of makeup artist, photographer, and post-production designer.
When the photos came out, we and the people around us couldn't stop praising them.
I have already recommended my best friend, and she was equally delighted after seeing the photos.
I hope such studios won't be buried, more people can discover it and take photos with their own style, instead of being all the same.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to complete the task as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
A sweet and caring assistant, and a lively and cheerful photography teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting and an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I expected. Thank you everyone. 😘😘
Thank you for your comments, Xiao Yu. It's fate that we have met. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust between us has spanned thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you. I hope to have the chance to come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the students from this training institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hi, I'm not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation. Learning this subject is closely related to one's own situation.
For example, your profession, age, language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will be related to the field you are studying or want to pursue.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one has a high learning cost, two requires a lot of time, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can afford to pay certain learning costs and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it also helps in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my views. As I don't know your situation, what I said before is only a brief introduction and not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it all on the app.
What is called?
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) wall-mounted stove, water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lighting installation, glass cleaning, professional sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me their approval, striving hard for life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
Life won't let down those who work hard. Follow me if you like it. Thank you to those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, while we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. The road can be looked back on, but not walked back on...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue is worth it at that moment, and there will be a return for the effort!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fong Gee Home Services has done its best to provide you with "clean" service and love your home.
Keep every family clean, set a benchmark for housekeeping services, and provide cleanliness to the home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and dark. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Success comes from doing things with care, and craftsmanship is achieved through meticulousness. We take our sewing seriously.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to find a job in any industry right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough persistence, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day starts with the morning, and all the good things start from the morning. I hope you start a new day with joy, luck, health and all the best. Keep a good mood all day. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something that we had when we possessed it; when we grew up, happiness became a goal that we achieved when we reached it; when we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and we were happy when we understood it.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live a long and beautiful life!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, what constrains you is not your ability, but the courage to positively face it.
Since avoidance is not an option, it is better to face it with acceptance.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face the challenge head-on, the problem will eventually be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia collaborate to host the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the JAX Art District in Diriyah, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is co-curated by the Saudi Deriyyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China director Fei Yu Tian as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennial is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly acclaimed, some of whom used recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain Series" (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Daryl Yeo, CEO of the Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this Biennial could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia that is booming, and to strengthen mutual interaction.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the Biennial is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to be integrated into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural public welfare posts, to help promote the comprehensive revitalization of the countryside.
According to the relevant personnel of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the impoverished people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of personnel recruited for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that positions should be set according to the principles of "position setting according to demand, personnel assignment according to position, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one position per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and arrangement for on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts.
The address is wrong.
Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I am placing an order again.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right-wing has had successful times in history, they have not lasted long. Therefore, they are short-lived, shining brightly when given a bit of sunshine and sweating when given a bit of water; they can reach great heights when successful, but suffer greatly when met with setbacks.
But to be realistic, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his statements and also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes seriously the social issues in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, a mixture of political groups, and foreign powers taking advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, to change or improve China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of the situation through political opportunism are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left again.
The Left is actually a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Recently, I saw some friends arguing with traitors and refuting the madman, which was quite impressive. However, I think it is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both unreasonable and there is no point in trying to argue.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the opposition and the left-wingers to admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you a five-cent, and when the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or they become obsessed with pursuing them.
As his dreams drifted further away, the Dragon Slayer eventually became an Evil Dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom, and due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese history and culture, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing in the country emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the competition between China and the US is left-leaning, which is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
No more words, Hua Hua is so righteous.
In the past two years, the United States' blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to American-based companies.
The United States has been suppressing the Chinese chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and decreased production capacity of chip manufacturing companies, thus causing a shortage and chaos in the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the chip shortage has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies suspending production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips have been severely affected.
In order to gain control over "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have been taking frequent actions recently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish the Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing US local technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old US technology giant Intel invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened its chip outsourcing business.
While most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and could very likely snatch away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-fashioned American technology giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technological reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdainfully dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful of Intel's foray into the semiconductor industry because he still remembered the grudges between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the pearl of the manufacturing industry in the United States of America, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the semiconductor field.
Up until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful entities.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chips were designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of pressure on small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to give up in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
It is unexpected that the giant which looked down on the wafer fabrication service in the past now has to start doing wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was ironic.
Now the market value of TSMC has surpassed Intel.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stay stagnant.
Now, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel still remains at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to overtake the competition.
I'm not waiting anymore.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some weird trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Selecting three hot topics randomly: February 2nd Dragon Raising, Haoliyu Price Increase, and the Hualala Incident, public opinion spread and formed a peak, then [index decreased] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small hump will appear again.
They look no different from the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event can present a [peak], [sawtooth], and [cliff] pattern.
【Peak】That is, artificially heating up, quickly rushing into the hot search list, causing public attention; 【Sawtooth】That is, periodic heating up, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff】That is, collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and is ready to take on a new task and rush to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water armies receiving the task and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which manipulate decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuned operations, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12th. According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the novel coronavirus OMK-R strain.
Mauritania reported its first two cases of Omicron strain infection on the 10th.
According to Kailash Jagutpal, the Minister of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30th after contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are all students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they are all mild cases, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho strain, the government of Sierra Leone is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Kumbuzo Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and discovered 3 cases of infection.

DaMei360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No. 156, Ring City South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time and only showed them my floor plan. They didn't measure the house in person, but they were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000. They roughly showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will pressure you to pay a deposit (which you can never get back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated. In a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, didn't include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
Besides these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced, with a specialized team to deal with me.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem and they are not responsible at all.
They shift the blame around and there are many details that I don't want to talk about, all in all, don't choose them because my friend's house that they renovated was of poor quality and they will charge you for various fees later.
Damn it, they are the same scammers who used to be called Longtou Decoration, now they changed to Da Mei, and now it seems like they have closed down and changed to something else.
Therefore, don't choose such a shady renovation company.
When choosing in the future, everyone should do more Baidu searches and consult these because home improvement is not a small expense.

It's so scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then. If the refund isn't received within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

Stargazers, get ready! The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th. - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Anjiu, an astronomy enthusiast from Beijing, photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical popularization, introduced that just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini Meteor Shower usually appears at the end of the year, and its "showing period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the Geminids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move slowly, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
A recommended index chart for the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the "falling stars" of the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the level of excitement will be discounted.
On the fourteenth day of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can one observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast. Then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Photographers who enjoy photography should choose a wide angle and large aperture lens to capture stunning shots of a meteor shower. When shooting, use a high ISO and the largest aperture.
Tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential considering stability and sustainability.
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of Laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, in 2020, the sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for its success in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The SESI Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
In the current era of increasing emphasis on visual health, Laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuously declining prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be some truth to it.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short-focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, with little space needed and a small, compact host, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
With lower heat output and less equipment loss, the life span of a television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a false demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audiovisual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some ambient light, using a microstructured Fieller screen is expensive; the price of an 80-inch screen is basically enough to exchange for a 65-inch LCD.
Additionally, I particularly despise projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. Even if you take LCD TVs seriously, it is also diffuse "direct" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it can't form an image at all.
What is really uncomfortable is that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is neglected, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes from a certain angle.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Premium Quality Store currently has no branches.
After adding WeChat to make a reservation, the lady sent me the available time slots, and she replied to my messages in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the store's photography works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and there were many styles of photography involved.
When I arrived that day, I had a brief conversation with the staff about my ideas. She patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with, and finally decided to start the makeup and styling. Before the photographer started shooting, he would arrange some props and guide the action, and he was also very meticulous about the details.
But it might not be the style I wanted because we didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style, which feels very thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, just wait for the result~
I won the photography-themed feast for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He feels a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.

Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
First fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store, then choose the clothes, wedding dresses are also available. They were quite patient when I tried on three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I spent a long time on makeup and the service attitude was also good. Later, they will teach you how to pose for the photography. The only downside is that the photos look like my face is too big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received it in three or four days, and it didn't seem to be much different from the original.
[Environment] Overall it is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside is a photography studio.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
Photographers will also take the time to teach you poses.
If not satisfied, the photographer will also proactively suggest a reshoot.
[Experience] The styling may be a bit too much, the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows was also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily no-eyebrow makeup.
The photos were delivered in ten days, but the photoshopping effect was not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Not sure what style to go for, I tried on two dresses and eventually chose the black dress. The salesperson said this one was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. Both the hairdresser and the makeup artist were very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites for retouching. The photographer said he would have the finished product within 15 days and I am very satisfied with the outcome.
I haven't received a reply for 3 days... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for each payment.
I have to pay the shipping fee every time now.
Can I be exempted first and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance from Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the Internet.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance broker company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In summary, these three requirements are quite stringent, requiring strength, approval from the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, with both the claimant and the insurer being Hetai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode, the products of Internet platforms have a higher cost-effectiveness than those of traditional offline channels, due to the absence of operating expenses and salaries of business personnel. Moreover, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, which can reduce the burden of policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professionalism of the insurance agent, this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can apply for insurance themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance phone sales on "Tencent Weibo" (which is the same as Little Umbrella, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, free to get 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they won't tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the following months need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers don't know what they bought after deducting the fee for one or two years.
It's like getting 600 million from an insurance company for just one dollar (like a dream come true).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - free coverage of 60,000 for critical illness is short-term. If there is no other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 won't be enough to solve the problem and life will start to become bare.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the mis-selling of internet insurance.
Therefore, overall, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have more products and more opportunities for customers to choose from. Some products also have better cost-effectiveness than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before underwriting, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During underwriting, I will compare and contrast three companies for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results. After underwriting, I will arrange and custody the policy for customers, so that they can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
During this process, neither the policyholder nor the insurance advisor needs to sign anything, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there is no "ceremony" when purchasing Internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telemarketing" assembly line job, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, should we think carefully about the "intermediary" we choose, whether it is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to give me compensation?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider just left the delivery at the doorstep and then left.
Still wrong
Your rider has picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but I'm still waiting for it to arrive.
The delivery rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to depart.
I'm done shopping, do you want any other takeout?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Alright, if you don't cancel it, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene issues.

No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to these villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me Facebook friend requests, then posted sarcastic posts, and then tried to post what you claimed were my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed. I...just let it go.
Later, I received messages from multiple friends about your Facebook friend account with a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment elements.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After the news of my reporting to the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
Yes, you can continue with this sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are only caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your plan or continue to make all offensive comments.
That's right, I can't, and I have no ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you either. My looks and figure don't need your judgment.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself for fame.
My friend asked me if I was doing okay.
I said yes, but you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those without even basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I have cut out some of the messages for everyone to evaluate.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the post you sent yourself, right?
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
Smile with understanding
Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Ruan Mengxiong stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the novel coronavirus, the number and revenues of Vietnam's digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has increased, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform, and to take on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared their mobilization and gathering of social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, and put forward breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the only way for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services all citizens, so it is necessary to mobilize all citizens to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises.

Why is it necessary to re-produce?
That's totally outrageous.

Here, the home appliances are complete, with many brands, including all the well-known brands.
On Double Twelve, go to the "Hanson" water purifier store to check out the water purifiers. There is an activity going on in the store with more favorable prices.
Juran Home has a total of 11 floors, from Basement 2 to 9th floor. Basement 1 and Basement 2 are both parking places and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very good, there are few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the restaurants is average.
This elevator is also very frustrating, just like a big illness. It goes back and forth between the negative second floor and the negative first floor, no matter how many times I press the button for this floor. It's also very frustrating that it goes directly to a furniture store, and the furniture store is closed, so I can't get out of the safety passage!
Juren Home still needs to be improved, there are many areas that have not been developed.
Address: No.555, Gaotie North Road, Shayibake District, convenient transportation, large parking lot, free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is huge, with 8-9 floors, and you can buy furniture, home appliances, and various small things. Many famous brands have settled in the store, such as Mushi, Oppo, Huadi, Laoban, Fengchuangzhijia, Hansdun, Yak, Youbang, Silian, Fupinju, Wanjiale, Nature, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadan... There are so many brands that I can only remember these. It is a good place to buy products, and you can rest on the sofa when you are tired.
Recently I want to buy a comfortable sofa. My friend said there are many sofas to choose from. I looked at GJ Home Furnishing and Mecor and felt they were okay, but the price is a bit expensive, so I'm still in a dilemma.
Dianping Urumqi Home Furnishing Store Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as Gaotie Home address, phone number, business hours, etc. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
I have already sent it to My Guests, but #PRS_ORG# can't finish it.
It's done, it's done.

The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service zones have covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service zone is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capabilities have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the marine green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services to ships and sailors, helping them solve the "urgent distress" problem.
The two water-based green integrated service areas built and operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living services, production services and government services as one, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. It will realize the "one-time mooring and multiple services" of ships in the port, making the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and the most powerful weapon in the US Navy armory is making a rare visit to Guam. According to a report from the pro-China media outlet Duowei, this sends an important signal to both the US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, on January 9th, a satellite detected the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-borne transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Abraham Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the USS Shoup missile cruiser and the USS Stockdale missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US three aircraft carriers gather around China, the strongest weapon rarely visits Guam. On January 17, 2022, the US Navy carrier-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B flew the route.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence.
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The US has assembled three aircraft carriers around China, with the rare visit of the most powerful weapon to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US has sent its three aircraft carriers to the vicinity of China, the strongest weapon rarely seen visiting Guam. In recent years, China has been building a large number of military facilities in the Paracel Islands.
The picture is Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rampage Submarines" in the US Navy Fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomer" the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad, which also includes launch silos for ballistic missiles on US soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
When talking to friends about Meta's recent plunge of 26%, with a market value evaporating of $251 billion, why did Zuckerberg respond that they are facing unprecedented competition?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Regardless of the functional positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform to realize monetization.
But, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow apps to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has about hundreds of employees in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but more importantly, on expectations for the future.
Clearly, the expectations for Meta are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current popularity and its annual revenue of 10 to 20 billion US dollars, Facebook is actually feeling a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies, it does not have any good security walls.
Although his several social apps have a relatively high daily active users and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Attempting to reach the unattainable concept of the universe in a short period of time is completely hopeless, which is why Facebook is so dangerous. This is also why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new paths. However, I think his choice of paths was wrong and it was a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.
