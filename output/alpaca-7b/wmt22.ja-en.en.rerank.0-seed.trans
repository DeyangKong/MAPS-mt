I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was so popular on TV.
Yesterday, I watched Chirori with my staff members. Although it was not very interesting, my staff members started laughing out loud at some parts of the movie. It was quite amusing.
It's not funny when people are trying to sell things. But it's really amusing when they're just talking. That's why I always laugh when I see a salesperson trying to be funny. It's not their fault if it doesn't work out.
Even if the staff don't laugh, it's still not fun to be around when the atmosphere is so tense and unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and the egos of some artists are getting in the way. It's too bad because it used to be so cool.
I can't help but feel sorry for the hardships of being a creator when I hear stories of other creators struggling with their own work. It's really sad how much it happens.
Although income is not much, I'm trying to make a living as an artist. It's hard work but I'm determined to reach the top of the toppest mountain.
There is a tendency for people to become celebrities overnight and become popular on social media and other media outlets, which leads to an imbalance in the society. However, there is no proper way to address this issue.
It's quite difficult to make a living in this industry, but fortunately, the artist's world is filled with surprises and there are always new opportunities to be found.
You are so foolish.

I was so surprised when I received the wrong item I had ordered from the online store.
The store promised to send a wireless mouse when I ordered it, but instead it sent a wired one. They said they would refund me if I wanted to return it.
The topic of self-made PCs has become quite popular recently, but it seems to cause some trouble. However, it's still worth considering as there are many renowned stores offering great deals.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (including tax) at a Tsukumo net shop on the same day as the start of the sale.
Since the price of the same product with and without the wireless version was the same, I checked the price of the wireless version page as well and it was 5,071 yen (the link is to the Squidward page). There was no misprice, so I ordered it.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipment mail also arrived normally.
The name "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order to delivery, I thought the wirelessly delivered mouse would arrive at that moment.
From here it became a problem, and after several hours of shipment, I received an email saying "There was an error in product registration".
That's what the mail said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version that was being sold.
Since we are already sending wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse and get a refund.
Use a wireless mouse without any modification.
Choose an appropriate response.
It appears that the product page of both the wireless and wired versions have been mixed up, so that the purchase history, mail and even the wireless version has been changed without notice. This is really unacceptable.
Did you understand the product you bought is different from the one you sent back? If you want to return it, can you get your money back from here?
Please lend me your wisdom so that I can repay the debt and launch a counterattack.

The only bridge out of the town that was swept away by the tsunami and flooding has been seen streaming out of the area in a video taken by a drone in the town of Kawai, Fukushima Prefecture. The residents are reportedly stockpiling food and water three times as much as usual.
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa-machi, Kuma-gun, Fukushima-ken.
The great impact of the 8-person sleeping arrangement in the third-floor room was felt in 2019's East Japan Typhoon.
Mr. Matsumoto san : "At first, it was a feeling of'magic'."
It was a very lonely feeling when the only road connecting the town with the mountain, the Tohoku-Oki Bridge, was swept away by the Tohoku-Oki tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the local family were left stranded in the disaster zone.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's great that the bus can come all the way from the station to the garden. You can just get off the bus and start walking, or if you're feeling lazy you can just hold onto the handrail and walk across the bridge. It's so much better than taking the bus and dealing with the traffic and the hassle of finding a taxi. It's really nice that they built the bridge so quickly." One month after the bridge was completed, it was washed away by a sudden rainstorm. For three months, the village was once again in a state of isolation.
After two years of rebuilding from the disaster, Matsumoto-san has been continuing his efforts to educate people about disaster prevention.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about buying 10 cases of beer.
We should secure enough food for two to three days, such as canned goods and instant noodles, to be prepared for any emergency.
Ms. Masako Sato said, "I don't know when a disaster will strike me, so I'm trying to build up a bit of a reserve and be prepared for anything. I felt that way after experiencing the unexpected disaster." Meanwhile, Yamanashi Mayor Katsunobu Sato, who has experienced multiple disasters, said, "I'm always prepared for the unexpected."
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to develop its own unique take on the matter.
The town of Kagami is going to hold an event called "Disaster Prevention Day" on October 12th in the future. We would like to think about what kind of preparations we can make for disaster prevention on that day.
Even though we have already experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.

Experience the Paralympic Games in Virtual Reality (Tokyo MX News)
Tokyo City will be able to hold a marathon race recreated digitally as a Paralympic event in 2021.
This event has been created to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo through digital means.
There were running machines and road bikes prepared at the venue, and people who visited the venue were able to recreate a marathon course in a virtual space by attaching special equipment.
Each tablet showing a virtual space will have an avatar of the participant appear, allowing for an experience of running a marathon while competing with participants from both inside and outside of Japan. Furthermore, it will be possible to enjoy sightseeing at popular tourist spots in the city.
Participants were amazed by the beautiful scenery which changed so suddenly.
The Tokyo Marathon was a great experience. I enjoyed running through the city streets while taking in the sights and sounds. I especially enjoyed the atmosphere of the race, with people cheering and encouraging each other as we ran. I'm looking forward to participating in more marathons in the future, including ones outside of Tokyo. The Tokyo Marathon organizer also expressed their wish to build a sports stadium in the future so that people can continue to enjoy running and competing in marathons.

When buying a used house, be careful!
The hole caused by the collapse of the building status survey system (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
Towards the revitalization of the used housing market, a new system for inspecting building conditions has been set up. Used housing transactions have been going smoothly.
The price of construction and the market for renovation are both increasing, showing a tendency towards expansion.
As the number of people aiming for a house near the station has increased, the demand for high-rise buildings has grown rapidly. As a result, the price of new construction has become relatively inexpensive.
Although existing (used) housing share in Japan is still low in comparison with overseas, it is gradually increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started the Building Condition Survey, which is aimed at ensuring safe and secure used houses, in 2018 (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a builder who has become skilled in residential construction checks the current situation and condition of the building, including its deterioration, and presents it to the prospective buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers with the introduction of inspections.
By conducting an inspection of the goods before the purchase and sale transaction, the merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning afterward and provide the buyer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been increasing due to the competitive nature of society.
Even if you are on the buying side, you can understand the condition of used houses for purchase by grasping the system, and thus benefit from it.
On the system of the current building inspection, the main responsibility for leading the inspection lies with the seller.
In addition, we should pay attention to the fact that the announcement of the inspection system has become obligatory at the workplace.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to inspect the building conditions when handling a property, but in practice, it is not obligatory.
Although there is a risk of being anxious in the inspection of the salesperson in Japan, overseas it is possible to switch one's gaze to the vibrant used car markets of America and the United Kingdom, where similar systems have already been established.
Before engaging in the process of buying or selling a house, the buyer usually hires a specialist such as an inspector or building surveyor to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the case of America, the percentage of inspections for used houses in the states ranges from 70 to 90%.
In terms of the point where the "buyer" is leading the inspection, the "seller" is the main type of Japanese inspection and its nature is quite different from the "seller" led inspection in other countries.
The owner of the building can often be seen inspecting the condition of the building, even if only slightly, in order to raise its value and sell it quickly.
We are considering moving to a place where we can feel safe and secure.
Even if we have the same goals and thoughts, there is still a chance of misunderstanding due to language barrier.
For this reason, the risk of becoming complacent about the Japanese system is highlighted by the following points:
The scope of inspection of the salesperson-customer relationship model determined by the country shall not be minimized.
Since detailed survey is not possible, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing the customer's case to the third party (selling agent) is effective.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the company fails to report unfavorable survey results to the customer or engages in other "trickery".

Is the Silver Zone an island?
Silver-haired people are often seen talking in cafes, but what kind of conversations do they have? Here are 5 popular topics among the silver-haired.
This place was a peninsula in the past.
That's why it's a bit difficult to find a place to expose your own little bit of scholarly research in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square in Tokyo. It's quite interesting and entertaining.

As you walk through the Ginza district, you can find mysterious stone monuments, numerous temples, and a history of the area carved in stone.
As she walked through the streets of Tokyo, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a profound silence. She realized that she had stumbled upon an ancient ruin from the past.
Is the Silver Zone the Hakusai Peninsula?
The nickname "Ginza" for the bustling city in Japan is popular not only in Tokyo, but also in other cities such as Osaka and Fukuoka.
The Ginza, which is now a popular shopping and entertainment district in Tokyo, was originally a silver smithing shop located in Edo (present-day Tokyo) in 1612.
At that time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but eventually became known as "Ginza" due to its transfer to that location.
According to the news, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed through the area now known as Tokyo and the surrounding cities. During this period, the river was known as the "Edo River". A large island called "Edojima" extended from the Sumida River to the Tokyo Bay. This island was gradually extended as the Edo Period progressed, forming the present-day Tokyo.
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Ginza.
Toyotaka Hideyoshi opened a ruling palace in Edo and buried the moat, thus beginning the construction of the Kyobashi district.

In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worth taking a look.
People know the "Holy Pilgrimage" of the Silver Zone in Ginza.
Silver Zone is a place where the "Silver Zone Hachiman Shrine MEGURI" is held annually. This is a sacred ritual to worship the shrine.
In the sacred grounds of a Shinto shrine, the most captivating sight is the Kabuki Theater located in front of it.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki theatre.
One side, the "Lion King" statue is on the roof of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, the "Silver Pavilion" statue is on the 9th floor of the Sensoji Temple.
The Shrines of Inari, located in various places, are often seen as the guardian deities of rice and sake. The most famous of these is the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, which is dedicated to the god Inari and is known for its thousands of bright orange torii gates. Other notable shrines include the Tori-no-Ichi Shrine in Tokyo, the Adashino Inari Shrine in Nara, and the Suwa Taisha Shrine in Suwa, which is dedicated to the god Susanoo.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian spirits as well as the gods of the land and sea. However, most shrines only worship the gods of the harvest by offering rice and other crops as a sacrifice.
In front of the shrine, a fox would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the shrine was built with the hope of receiving the good fortune of a bountiful harvest.
As it has been transformed into a bustling metropolis like Kyoto and Edo, the benefits of commercial activities are becoming increasingly apparent. Not only in Japan's most prosperous city, Tokyo, but also in its vibrant shopping district, Ginza, faith is also widely practiced.

The Korean company Posco has acquired the Senegalese energy company Enagás, and is looking to expand its overseas gas business. This news was reported by the Korean media (WoW!Korea).
Posco International announced on November 12 that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement and an investment agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, aiming to acquire a stake in the two companies.
Due to the fact that various procedures such as the consent of the host company and local NGOs are still pending at the Senex Enagic Corporation's Annual General Meeting, the purchase and sale procedures are expected to be completed by March 2021.
In 2010, the acquisition of Posco by the Posco Group became the world's largest M&A case in the history of purchase and merger (M&A).
The total amount of purchases and sales was 7709 billion yen, with Posco International investing 50.1% and Hancock Natural Resources investing 49.9%.
Posco International announced that the demand for natural gas is continuously increasing in the Energy Transition Age and that hydrogen is becoming an important element in the hydrogen market, and explained that they have decided to purchase in this context.
Posco International will secure 802Bcf of natural gas storage and 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in Korea through this purchase.

That pain in the knee, if it's not treated properly, could be "Changement Knee Joint Disease"!!
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC - Yahoo! News)
The Editing Department: We have been suffering from pain in the knee recently.
Is there a possibility of catching such a disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of the pain in the knee joint can be various, such as knee joint inflammation, ligament and tendon tears, and overuse injuries.
In Japan, it is very common for people to have "joint contracture disorder".
Is it possible that the editing team will be affected by the changes in the schedule?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Our job is to cover the soft tissues of the joints with a thin layer of cartilage, to absorb the impact of shock, and to make the movements of the joints smoothly.
The reason why soft tissues become stiff and deformed is due to aging, obesity, and intense sports.
As a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
Does knee joint pain often occur in addition to foot pain?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Even outside the knee, there are joints and tendons of the fingers, wrist, elbow, rib cage, hip, and ankle which can cause pain.
Unfortunately, the most common case is a case of "Spondylolisthesis", which is a condition where a vertebra slides forward over the one below it.
What is the structure of a joint like?
Mr. Maruyama said, "The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are irregularly arranged."
Then, the two-sided portion that is covered with "Joint Flexible Cartilage" is surrounded by "Joint capsule" which is covered with "Synovial Membrane".
The editorial team is complicated and structured.
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
There is a layer of lubricating tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule. It creates the joint fluid by secreting lubricating substances.
This synovial fluid performs a lubricating role, and is composed of hyaluronate and condrocyte sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joints smoothly requires good sources of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms do people with Transforming Joints Disease (TJD) typically experience?
Professor Maruyama: Connective tissues are elastic and flexible, and bones do not directly touch each other, so they have to bear the role of providing stability.
Iwaba is a role like that of a maid in a café.
If you are constantly straining your muscles, it can cause joint deformities, inflammations, and pain.

Experience the thrill of the "Kaiji" series with a real-life gambling and game show 3-pack (with real sound)!
Gyaru manga series "Kaji" centering on male characters, which is popular for its explosive and wild plot.
One of the flavors of the original work is an extreme game of life and death.
[Picture] Just watching the feet move...... Challenging the Iron Bridge!
Let's test the game of Kaji, which is actually playable in this place, or is being practiced as a planning video.
The trap-filled Pachinko Parlour "Nul" appeared in the movie "Gambling Ghost Story".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the spectators.
This "pond" has a huge trap of the 3-stage curtain installed, making it almost impossible to infiltrate.
They used every available hand to lower the water table beneath the foundation of the building, and eventually succeeded in overturning the defenses.
The character "Kai" from the anime "Kai-Ni-Pachi" has become popular and is now appearing in many arcades where people are playing the game.
Even though things like "One-Thousand-Dollar Coupons" have become less common, it is still possible to enjoy the feeling of getting something for nothing.
The "Star Side Party" was held, in which the participants included a group of investors who had been subjected to a pyramid scheme. It was a re-enactment of the "Torikago" ritual from the "Human Chariot" race.
The debtors are struggling to keep their balance on the narrow steel bones installed on the ground 10 meters above, while they are contriving various techniques to move faster.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win the prize money, but there is only one steel bone, which is not enough for safety measures, and the chance of death is quite high.
This steel bridge is very dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game and installed at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", where it is possible to have an extremely close experience.
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors) and is located at a steel-framed bridge which is called "Skybride" and "Victory Bridge" at its end. People are encouraged to walk towards it.
We are taking all necessary safety measures.
Corey Feldman, the comedic actor, has become a sensation in Japan after uploading a video of himself walking across the famous Tokyo Bridge, claiming it can be experienced in Japan through the "Tokyo Bridge Walking" challenge.
This is a two-player card game called "EKaard".
Use one Emperor card, eight citizen cards, and one slave card to make a deck of 10 cards for each side, Emperor side, and slave side to play.
This game is extremely powerful, the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.

The person then used this machine to cause chaos in the river Ganges by severely lowering their body temperature to an abnormal value, resulting in victory.
The card is available in stores, such as Amazon, where it can be purchased.

Take a step towards the new year, and make it special by visiting a shrine or temple. In this article from the Yamanashi newspaper, there is a picture of a beautifully decorated horse at a Shinto shrine.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Kagura Shrine in Yamagata City, where a giant ema featuring the Chinese zodiac animal of the upcoming year, the Ox, has appeared.
On November 11th, 11 students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited a shrine and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting apprenticeship of the original painting of the horse from a craftsman since last year.
Nine students from the Japanese Painting Course taught by Prof. Kazuo Shiraga and Sadamasa Motai at the University of Tokyo Department of Fine Arts have had their works selected for employment. 22-year-old Yui Sasaki (柚衣) is one of them.
The giant horse is 3.3 meters wide, and its center height is about 1.8 meters.
Mr. Tsuya drew an image of a person pushing their way through the crowd with a bouquet of sakura petals in their back.
I wish to be filled with a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the beauty of nature, even in a world of constant change.

I want to continue living in Tama-no. I propose a workshop for high school students in the city. The theme is "Digital Tama-no News".
What kind of town was 1930's Yamanouchi?
Students from four high schools in the city of Tomakomai are participating in a workshop to discuss the idea of continuing to live in Tomakomai.
We are conducting a survey and policy proposal for the "Tamano S.D.G.S. Mirayuku Center" which is a business that provides employment for young people. We are gathering the voices of young people to present to the mayor.
What is funny in such a situation?
When the student was asked about the quality of the teacher, he replied, "When many people gather, it's exciting and energizing. That's when I feel most alive." He also answered, "I'm always drumming and dancing."
The first event was held at the Sunshine Ace Cafe on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and the locals from the area gathered around a table to discuss the themes they had chosen, such as "The Most Interesting Town", "The Most Livable Town" and "The Town That Makes You Feel Alive".
Each person's thoughts were written on a slip of paper and organized by sewing them onto a fabric.
A town with many young people is lively and interesting. There are many ways to get around, such as taking the train or bus.
We can't agree on anything, so let's talk some more.

The second meeting of the month of December was only for high school students, and was organized to discuss the contents of the proposal.
We are planning to announce the mayor and the education chief in February 2019.

The Secret of Store Shopping (Sankei News) - Yahoo! News
You mustn't forget to take your coat when you go out in the winter, but your head will get cold if you don't put on a hat.
While adjusting the balance by looking into the mirror, I heard a voice saying that it was difficult to understand.
When I thought there might be a secret store hidden somewhere, I was amazed to find a new thing.
The store of the brand "Cotto" (Kotori) is said to be around 1 meter long, making it more compact than the average store.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I make something this short and curly?"
When you look at it closely, you can see that it is a piece of cloth that has been carefully cut and sewn together into one long, thin piece. It has a net-like pattern all over.
The ends of the net are stretched so that it is possible to pass through them.
Even if you don't join the ends, you can still wrap it up by tying a knot.
The fabric is very light and warm.
This year, the popular trend is to combine a sleeveless top with a jacket, so that the jacket can keep you warm while still showing off the sleeveless style.
When you have a store like this, it's really convenient.

The documentary on the Beatles at Disneyland is super interesting.
Although Peter Jackson directed The Lord of the Rings, he was not the original director.
There are so many different kinds of butterflies. Every time I see them, I feel amazed. They are so beautiful and colorful.
Even though the scattering was about to begin, the sound of the gunshots echoed through the air. It was a dramatic and chilling scene.
While working hard, I suddenly realized I knew what Paul and George were talking about! It was amazing! I was so surprised that I couldn't help but laugh. I was so caught off guard that it felt like time had stopped. I was so amazed by what I had just realized that I couldn't help but smile.
It's so tiring to hear that kind of bickering all the time. But then, when I think about it, it's really not worth getting worked up over. It's just a waste of time and energy. That's why I try to stay positive and just keep working. That way, I can avoid getting into a bad mood and feeling down. That's what I think, anyway.
Everyone really starts to play in that special atmosphere.

Even though it was only three chapters into the story, the most influential factor behind the disbandment of the Beatles was the environment surrounding them.
Four people started to sing a song together. They were so excited and started to dance. Then they decided to make a live performance. Where should they perform? Talking about it, a producer and some promoters came up with the idea of "Let's take the Beatles around the world!" They started to spread the word and soon they became popular. Everyone was amazed by their unique and wonderful performance.
Ever since the documentary film about the making of the movie "The Dark Knight" came out, people have been talking about how Peter Jackson was so impressed by it that he felt compelled to re-shoot some of the scenes in his own movie. Even though it's been talked about a lot, it's still a mystery as to whether or not it actually happened.
Because Paul is watching the movie, there are a lot of scenes with Paul as the protagonist and the antagonist.

I had to change my job because I was getting too sick from the work I was doing. I had been working in the service industry, but I wanted to do something different. I thought about what kind of job I could do that was related to the service industry, but would be more interesting and fulfilling. I eventually decided to become a bartender, and it has been the best decision I've ever made. I love being able to interact with customers and make them feel welcome. I'm so glad I was able to make the switch!
I was able to find some things that I could be proud of even though I couldn't do much. I hope to be able to find things that I can do and become more independent in the future.
Considering this carefully can be tiring, so it's best to take a break and let your thoughts wander.
I think it is good to consult a company doctor or a lawyer once in a while. There might be some kind of system in place that you should try out at least once.
Even if life is a bit boring now, it will be fun later on.

In America, a large number of tornadoes caused severe damage to crops and caused an unexpected cold weather (Weather News - Yahoo! News).
A powerful typhoon, named Trami, has been rapidly intensifying since it made landfall in Japan on October 10th (Friday) night and is expected to move towards the America South.
As a result of strong cold air from the south below, the atmospheric condition became very unstable and thick clouds developed rapidly.
A warm and muggy air mass from the Southwest has been pouring into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking temperatures.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Monday (9th) and Tuesday (10th).
In a place where it was record-breakingly warm, a strong cold air from the sky 5500m below suddenly descended and formed an active front, resulting in a rapid development of the clouds in the shape of a line along the front.
It was rumored that the dragon eggs were hatching one after another in the outskirts of the village.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage decreases significantly during the summer and early fall.
The warning issued in one day during the winter season was reportedly heard 150 times near the location. It was reported in great abundance with a record-breaking number of people.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States has reportedly received over 400 reports of typhoons and tornadoes in just 10 days (Friday).
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the United States that are heavily concentrated along the southern and northern lines that extend from Texas to California and include the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado.
In the EF Scale, which is used to measure the strength of dragons in the Kanto region, the third strongest dragon, which was the 6th stage, reached EF3. During this time, a sudden gust of 70m/s was observed.
By surveying the damage from the storm, it is possible to determine whether it is an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese Version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the situation of Japanese buildings based on the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of JEF3 infection in America is high enough to cause considerable damage, such as the destruction of wooden buildings.

With regards to the typhoon damage in the U.S. Central and Southern states, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11th (Japanese time: November 12th), showed a remarkable performance of "the greatest typhoon damage in U.S. history" with a spiritual and impressive attitude.
CNN and other American television networks reported it.
Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the loss of so many lives.
The fear of death has surpassed 100 people.
In Kenitra, Morocco, residents have been removing damaged furniture and belongings from houses affected by the Kenza cyclone for the past 10 nights and continue to do so until 11am on November 15th. The Kenza cyclone has caused more than 30 deaths in at least 6 states.
According to records, the 1925 Mizoram tornado caused damage over a 219-mile (350-kilometer) stretch of land, but meteorologist Brandon Miller of CNN estimated the maximum intensity of this tornado to be 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In the wake of the devastating tornado in Kennett, Missouri, the Christmas shopping season was marred by a 24-hour state of emergency at the large factory, resulting in immense damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were gone.
A woman who was unable to move due to the thickness of the darkness beneath the 1.5-meter-high garbage pile felt the weight of the rescue worker as she searched for the garbage pile on her smartphone and Facebook Live broadcast.
In addition to the female announcer's plea for help, the sound of weeping and another female voice singing in a tremolo were heard during the live broadcast of "Happy Birthday to You".
An employee of a convenience store located in Meifield, named Barbara Brown, was found hiding in the basement of her house along with her 5-year-old child after the earthquake warning was issued. She was unharmed.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a terrifying sound like the roar of the sea.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take to recover from this disaster. But we will continue our selfless rescue efforts with a strong will.
In Ilinoi State, a warehouse of the internet shopping giant Amazon collapsed and at least 6 people were confirmed dead.
The shockwave from the train car being detached is causing the fences to shake and the roads to be blocked by overturned vehicles.
According to media reports, over 40 million people in the U.S. are without power due to the effects of the earthquake in Japan.

It is an old saying that approaches to evaluation systems of star charts are different from each other.
Other countries are arguing to reduce their points based on 5 stars, while Japan is arguing to increase their points by adding/reducing stars.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, and four stars are "deficient element" and "beautiful work".
When judging a work by five stars, if the work is perfect in every aspect, it will be classified as "the highest standard work" and will be awarded all five stars. However, if the work is lacking in any aspect, it will be judged as "deficient work" and will only be awarded three stars. Therefore, I think it is better not to present the concept of stars on the system level.

A colorful bounty of vegetables, carefully crafted into delicious takeout dishes at the specialty store "Hakobune".
"We want to make a restaurant where people can enjoy delicious food at a reasonable price," said Kikuchi Takayuki (39) and his wife Yui (38). The couple opened a restaurant in August 2018.
One of the popular menu items at the convenience store is "Fresh Fish and Shrimp Flatbread Sandwiches" (1000 yen).

"Flaky pastries like croissants are popular in Japan, but they can be expensive. Ebi-flaky is an affordable alternative that still has the same delicious, buttery flavor." (Kikuko-san)
Vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, onions, and potatoes are used to make a hearty meal of ramen, a type of Japanese noodle soup. Toppings such as sesame seeds, seaweed, and chili peppers are also added for flavor.
Vegetables are usually grown in a vegetable garden at home and then sold at a local farmers' market.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Mr. Kagayaki adds a touch of color to the table with his French-style cooking, such as ratatouille and salads.
One of the features of Japanese cuisine is its subtlety and refinement. For example, the flavor of dashi soup stock or tamagoyaki egg omelette is appreciated by people of all ages. This traditional cuisine has been blended with foreign ingredients and cooking methods to create a unique and enjoyable fusion.
Popular items include "Kokusan Gohan" (1000 yen) and "Hamburg Steak" (500 yen).
From next year, we will also be selling the processed meat product "Sharaku Tori Set" which can be used for making wine.

A family's long journey to protect the environment in China's border region was recently featured in the JBpress news website.
(Katou Yasuji: Find Asia Companies) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, and the species of mammals that live there are the world's first, while the species of plants are the world's third.
We recognize the value of biodiversity as proclaimed by the self-governing body, and not only do the self-governing body perform environmental protection, but also actively promote environmental activities by the local people.
The province of Xishuangbanna (Western-sounding name: Sixty-four Towns) in the southwestern part of China is one of the regions in the country.
The area around the city of Sa Pa in Lao Cai province, Vietnam, is home to the Lao and the Hmong people, who share the same culture and language. It is also the ancestral home of the Tai (Tai Yuan) people, who are one of the 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam.
The source of the Mekong River is flowing through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Saisiyat people (Southwestern Tai people) live in the Saisiyat Autonomous County of Taiwan. The area of Saisiyat is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wildlife and 20% of the species of plants in China.
I visited Lixin Guo, a Chinese environmentalist who is currently in Japan for an environmental protection activity. We had a talk about the activity and its contents.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together ― They have been doing it for 20 years.
What was that sudden noise?
Mr. Li has been leading our environmental protection activity "Tenchu" since 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This area is the only tropical rainy forest in China, and it boasts a great diversity of life.
Despite that, the economic growth has been slowing down.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, we had to import large amounts of rubber from China, where there was a shortage due to the previous hot and rainy season.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
After that, I was married to the journalist and became friends with him.
Was Mr. Li interested in nature conservation before?
My father is from Shimane Prefecture, but I am not interested in the meaning of the term "heat-tolerant rainforest" or its biological diversity.
We have become accustomed to advancing the project without knowledge or experience.
Although the face is adjusted without any special effort, the back is not high enough to be seen by others. Why is that?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.

There was nothing remarkable about what he said, so I couldn't understand the meaning.

[Personal Memory Loss] Due to the cause of CTD, it took me about a month and a half to finally identify the problem.
Even though there were multiple factors causing CTD, such as lack of sleep and rest, I was able to identify the issue by taking a break and feeling the sensation.
Why did you not analyze the log files with the.NET Script Framework? (It will take a few minutes to understand.) Some errors are related to DLL series and hash table, so they cannot be ignored.
The timing of the main CTD is important.
* All plug-ins, such as Papyrus and.NET Script Framework, should leave a trace in the log.dll plug-ins' log without leaving any footprints.
If you have the SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's revised version of the Essentials mod installed, it will cause the console to crash when you try to kill an NPC. To fix this, go into the OFF folder and delete the file called "Essentials.esm".

I am thinking about the importance of spiritual care visitation nursing - today's visitation nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from dual-diagnosis, I have been undergoing long-term counseling and therapy. However, I am fortunate to have formed a strong bond with the visiting nurse who has been providing my care. She is very patient and has built a great relationship with me.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and dressings in the nursing care (such as wound care), it is more important for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which I found out in today's visiting nursing care.
Today, we had a discussion about gender differences and it was quite interesting. We laughed a lot.
So, what happened when she left her husband? Was it because of their differences in sexual desire? Or was it something else? Such a story would be interesting to hear.
Although I am wearing a skirt, I am still a man.
When the visiting nurses' station at the psychiatric hospital was closed, there was no one to give instructions to the visiting nurses or the occupational therapists, so I heard stories like, "This place is where medical care is provided, so you should know what to do," from people who had worked there.
I am using the social welfare system, but it is a small visiting care station run by the social welfare organization, so I am grateful for the kindness of the staff, who understands my mental illness and treats me kindly. I hope to find a good caregiver like Frank.
You are so beautiful.
Both those who have received psychiatric care and those who are considering it should consider the implications of their decisions carefully.
Visiting a nursing home is very meaningful for people with mental and physical illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
Even though I was angry, I decided to cancel the contract from here.

The Japanese patent for water technology and the Chinese five-year plan for slowing down the economy have been leaked. (Central China News - Japanese Language Edition)
The Japanese government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap for 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 600,000 electric vehicles across the nation and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of water was set to 6,000 yen per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
Unfortunately, the target of 27% for fuel cell vehicles in the 2011 fiscal year has not been met yet. (Approximately 1700 units)
The percentage of hydrogen stations in Japan has reached 38% (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is almost the same as the load map announced at the time of the previous announcement.
It has been found that the load map of the water element economy is far below the target value.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) released a report titled "The Current Situation and Policy Directions of Hydrogen Economy" on November 12.
According to reports, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the lithium-ion battery for automobile is supplied by Toshiba (Japan), White Gold Catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), Membrane Film by DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA).
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, are leading the world market for hydrogen technology patent applications, with an average growth rate of 14% per year since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of water production and fuel cells in Japan (2014-2020 cumulative), Korea is the fifth in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has been dominated by six countries, who collectively occupy more than 50% of the world's market share. In reality, they are the low-end producers.
The order of patent application filing in Japan, China, the United States, and Europe is China, the United States, Japan, and Europe.
In 2017, China overtook the US to become the largest economy in the world. Since then, it has been expanding the gap between the two economies.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) ranked 4th, but China (4721 cases) was 22% higher than the standard.
The Japanese government should designate "water element technology" as a major "national strategy technology" and invest in its research and development, as proposed by the Japanese Water Element Association.
I have had surgery to cut the tendon of my finger for about a month.

Since I can't move without feeling pain, I should probably rehabilitate myself.

Is it okay to ask for donations while doing volunteer work?
Volunteer work is not free, so it is important to be honest and sincere when doing it. Even though it may be difficult, a person must persevere.

Is selling high-priced goods than the store's fixed price a crime?
The PS5 was a big hit at the store, selling over 7 million copies.
It is appropriate.
For example, when branded goods become more expensive than usual, the demand for them decreases and the value of the goods decreases as well.
For example, when a renowned artist's work increases in value, it is considered to be the result of a fair market price.
The price of Ps5 is high, but it is still a rare and valuable item. Its price has risen higher than its original value.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine as part of a training mission for the country's armed forces, according to a report by CNN.
The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine reported on December 12th that weapons, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine as part of the assistance plan that was approved by the Ukrainian government.
The total amount of military aid to Ukraine is approximately $68 million. The last piece of equipment to be transported to Ukraine is a radar system to identify launch sites for rocket attacks.
According to the Caribbean News Agency, these weapons of mass destruction also included combat vehicles such as tanks and missiles.
The purpose of Russia's military support for Ukraine is to strengthen its national defense capabilities in the border area, including by receiving weapons, equipment, and training.
The U.S. is monitoring the movements of the Russian military and reinforcing its warning, while negotiating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and taking countermeasures in case of a Russian attack on Ukraine.
The Baiden Great Leader had agreed to accept weapons assistance from Ukraine's Zelensky Great Leader when he visited the White House on September 1, 2020.
Military assistance from the United States to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of approximately 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, resulting in a huge increase in aid to Ukraine.

The State of Florida sent troops to participate in the multinational joint training plan for Ukraine support in accordance with the instructions of the Japanese government.
According to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of Japan, the European Union Special Forces are playing a significant role in training and advising the Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of American special forces deployed in Ukraine is still classified as a secret.
The summit meeting between the two heads of state of Denmark and Russia, which was held on the 7th of this month, was followed by a tense standoff between the two countries due to the situation in Ukraine.

The LDP and Komeito have agreed to postpone the implementation of the consumption tax hike and to reduce the amount of money given to local governments. This is a major victory for the Abe government, as it has been able to avoid the unpopular tax hike and to reduce the burden on local governments. The LDP and Komeito have also agreed to reform the tax system, which will likely result in higher taxes for the middle and lower classes. This has been seen as a major betrayal by the opposition, with the DPJ and other opposition parties launching a fierce attack on the Abe government.
The first special issue of the Weekly Daiyamondo magazine on December 18th, 2018 is about "Family Conversations at the End and Beginning of the Year".

How do the rules of etiquette change with different cultures?
The LDP will be holding a tax reduction meeting with the DPJ's Mr. Yukio Hatoyama and Mr. Seiji Maehara, the two members of the House of Representatives, in order to discuss ways to bridge the gap between the two parties and to promote beneficial tax cuts.

In order to utilize pre-emptive donations to companies from the asset-rich families, the government should consider the following measures from the perspective of taxation: (1) Clarifying the criteria for taxation of pre-emptive donations and taxation of income from donations. (2) Establishing a neutral tax system that takes into account the timing of asset transfers. (3) Conducting a thorough examination of the potential effects of taxation on asset transfers.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill announced by the party last year has caused a great stir throughout the entire society, from the wealthy to the middle class.

Discussion on the integration of the consumption tax and donations tax.
On December 10th, 2020, the 22nd Annual Tax Revision Committee released a draft of the tax reform plan, titled "Making Clear the Nature of Gift and Inheritance Taxes". The plan proposed a number of changes to the current tax system, such as clarifying the nature of gift and inheritance taxes, increasing the tax-free allowance, and introducing a new taxation system for inherited assets. The committee also stressed the importance of continuously reviewing the plan in order to ensure its effectiveness.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Audit, Mr. Kamiyama, were speaking.
Making full use of the timing of asset transfers and avoiding losses is the most important thing.
"What kind of problems will come up as a result of integration? We are simulating the situation and will have three more chances for pro bono donations."
Even if it is not certain, it is the near future, and it is necessary to consider tax reduction measures as a form of pre-tax gift. Cutting large taxes is not correct.
How will the rules of succession tax and donation tax change specifically?

The team that won the first three games of the NFL season felt a variety of emotions, according to the players (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News).
This match, John's throw was caught by Peter. Peter's pass was only caught three times.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season when the Dallas Cowboys played the New York Giants in the famous "Snow Bowl" game. It was only the second time the two teams had met in the playoffs.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, a Hall of Fame RB, broke the then-record 2000-yard mark for the first time in NFL history.
The Builders were defeated by the Simpson and the one-man RB Gym Blackstone in a weightlifting contest.
The reason for the extreme offense deployed by the Payton Rottweilers was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains geographically close to the North Pacific Ocean.
Thus, this day was very cold, with the temperature almost at freezing point, and a strong wind of 18m/s blew, snowing before the match.
The buildings were only changed locally, and there was no major change in the selection of players.
For every 30 passes, the run should be 25 times.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
Interception was impossible, and we couldn't decide what to do next.
There were 4 Red Zone invasions in the Offensive Series and the Defensive Team got 10 points.
After the third quarter, they continued to run all the way to the Red Zone.
Although we only won 3 points in 3 matches, we didn't give up.
The defense before the last game.
The buildings that were chasing after the 4 points turned into Penalties at 3rd & 9th and 3rd & 14th.
The distance to the goal is 18 yards.
The Quarterback was surrounded by the rush of the defense on 3rd and 14, and he escaped to the right side of the field by throwing the ball out of the pocket.
So I threw a pass at the endzone to try to catch the td but it failed.
At this play, Esper W. Digger was running around the right outer area, but he couldn't get into the Endzone.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from outside the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabrielle Davidson. The pass was deflected by Payton's DB Miles Brian and Arlen failed to make a successful completion.
Brian had been working on the WRC Corral Beasley Walls for days, but when he saw the movement of the alien he let go of the WRC Corral Beasley Walls and reacted to the pass.
Allen threw two Endorses in order to pass the Reshiram and Zekrom.
We couldn't decide whether to take a 4th down or not, but there was no need to take a 3rd down since we weren't chasing any TDs.
It is possible to achieve a first down in two attempts of a play.
Since I was still at the 2-minute mark, I had to sprint to the finish line in order to utilize my own running ability.

3 items to spruce up your kitchen for the long term: 1. A set of coasters 2. A storage jar 3. A kitchen timer (Harper's BAZAAR)
Sponge
Even if you frequently replace it with something else, it will eventually become spongy.
Even though kitchen sponges are often used to clean dishes, they can actually harbor bacteria and fungi. Recent studies have shown that bacteria and fungi can reproduce rapidly in kitchen sponges even when they are not used for cleaning.
The German researcher who conducted this study recommended that the subject should rinse their mouth with a cleaning agent for one week and exchange the sponge once a day.
Manabu
The United States Department of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to replace damaged or worn out wooden planks with new ones.
Whenever a wound or sore starts to heal, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria start to multiply.
If you are still a big man, then dilute 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water with an odorless liquid bleach to make a table spoonful of solution and frequently disinfect your body without forgetting.
Immerse a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.
In the beautiful water, swimming is so enjoyable. By using the clean and soft paper towels, you can easily dry the water.
Dishware that has chips or cracks.
Even though it may be painful to divide your favorite magical cup, the uneven surface will become a warm and cozy home for bacteria and fungi.
It is also possible that the cause of the coughing or drinking problem is due to the missing part of the throat.

The samurai had a sacred duty to protect the village. The builder was forbidden to enter.
The samurai Mori Motonari swore an oath of retirement and seclusion at the temple of Kumano.

Community markets and trading are different things.
Should we use the Steam system at the community market?
This function can be used to commit red-handed fraud as it enables people to pay for items without using their own money.
That thing will not happen.
Trade allows for the exchange of items, or for presents to be given, but it has no buying or selling function.
Is the topic of employment and wages different from the topic of profession and salary?
I can't understand why people keep talking about the same thing over and over.
Even if the work is simple labor, there may be cases of irregular workers, such as those who are only doing it as a side job.
FlashBIOS will never end with your help.
I replaced the B550 and the Tomahawk with the Ryzen7 5800X in September.
I had tried to save the settings by restarting the computer but it just showed a black screen with a white cursor, and I couldn't even click anything.
Even if the BIOS has been damaged, FlashBIOS can be used to rewrite it without any problems.
According to the MSI blog, it takes about 5 minutes to finish the game, but you can still continue playing even after an hour.
The cause of the problem is an old USB memory and an SD card that has been changed.
Sleeping too much has caused Tomahawk to become bored.

Why do you feel ashamed of having brand-name products?
If it's something you can't put down, like a book or a pair of shoes, you can't put it down even if it's expensive. You might as well go for something with a good design, like a Louis Vuitton Monogram.
Why?
It's nice to think that I'm growing into a mature adult.
I think Japan is nice.
In Japan, it is.
There is no connection between the Gajin Wind and the Kagura.
It's better to talk early than to be silent all day, right? "Why do you keep quiet all the time?"
Why can't I just be treated as a foreigner without any relation? I was so angry when I said that.
I'm so frustrated with the low probability of success. I can't stop thinking about it even in my dreams.
Even though I had been living overseas, I still felt a sense of belonging to Japan. I was surprised when I encountered people who were so intolerant of other cultures.
If you appear to be a Westerner, there is no need to be concerned about having an evil spirit. Just be yourself and you will be fine.
If my friends were from Europe or America, I would call them by their last names. But since they are Japanese, I call them by their first names instead.
If you're friends with someone from Japan, they'll probably be really nice to you.
Even though it's just ordinary, it's still important to handle it with care. Otherwise, it will become a problem in the future.
Even if you speak the Japanese language, you won't understand the Japanese culture if you don't respect their rules.
Even though he had no relation with them, he always raised his glass higher than others at the drinking party.
Japanese people have a lot of unique habits, such as bowing and greeting each other with a lot of respect. I think it's amazing how they handle these habits in both formal and informal situations.
Japanese people are known for their unique and delicate mannerisms, regardless of their personality. (Including myself.) They tend to be quite observant of their surroundings.

Since I have only a limited ability to understand English, I will judge the text that has been translated only by its content.
The translated text may give a slightly awkward feeling, but it is understandable and there is no level restriction when playing (I thought it was interesting when I heard it from other people).
It is often difficult to find accurate translations for games made outside of Japan. However, small companies that specialize in localizing games tend to do a good job with their translations.
Can people who don't speak native Japanese understand the subtle differences between the two languages after long-term study?
I don't know what level you're trying to reach, but if Japanese people are able to feel comfortable even at a level that foreigners find interesting, then it's worth exploring.

There are various reasons why people want to have a place of their own to relax.

Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been causing a stir among the youth. According to reports, it is said to be "too extreme" in its content of self-discovery and growth.
It is commonly believed that the Battle Royale-inspired storylines are not popular with readers.
It took two years of hard training to become as powerful as the One Piece manga character, but all it took was a single touch to make him fly away joyfully.
There are many attractive things about the Earth, such as its diversity of cultures, languages, landscapes, and cuisines. However, there is one thing that is not so attractive: the tendency for people to stay in the same place and not explore or experience other cultures.
After the main character, Ashitaka, had completed his training with the sword of the demon slayer, he knelt down before the great warrior San, and offered him his own life in exchange for the life of the human princess, Princess Mononoke. It was from this moment that the great warrior San began to speak of taking the rights of life and death from others.

"Sou-gintsu" (lit. "Demon Slayer Corps Entrance Examination Hopeful") Tsuchikage left the area near the Kagami-ike Pond and introduced the nearby shrine. (This is either a reference to the character's noble and generous nature or a shameless attempt at fan service.)
When the first contact between Burdock and Mitsugi was revealed to be "What were you doing when your sister was eating people?", Mitsugi's response of "It's too late" triggered a fist-slap from Burdock.
In the midst of fan conversations, a never-ending exchange of stories and jokes can be heard.
If she were to follow behind the demonic sister, there is a possibility that she will be forced to make a judgement in that moment.
Initiation and the journey of growth from the imagination.
We went to the mountain in the fog, following the man who had not completed his training, and reached the summit by dawn. Along the way, we encountered a river of fire and a waterfall of sparks.
Before entering the mountain to perform the ritual of purification, one must make sure to check for hidden traps, such as pitfalls, hidden rocks, and snares.
Despite the intense stench of the rotting corpse of the witch Wana, the person was able to work with their hands and correct her mistakes with the help of their nose. They avoided the witch's curse by doing so.
Even though it was a sudden attack, he was able to avoid it completely by raising his body strength suddenly! He was so amazed that he couldn't help but exclaim, "It's amazing how powerful I've become!"
Suddenly, people who were ordinary before gained tremendous strength and skill without noticing. When they wake up, they can use this power and skill naturally as if it was their own potential.
People who have put in hard work deserve to be rewarded, but putting in effort without any results is a waste of time. The concept of "equal exchange of labor" is based on the superhuman power of extraordinary people, not on the praise of the weak. This rule is difficult to follow.

Samusung Electronics has opened a new "DX" department which emphasizes user experience, integrating home appliances and mobile devices (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News)
Following the integration of Samusung Electronics' CE and IM businesses, the company has decided to call the new entity DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect it in the organizational reform to be announced on the 12th.
Through various services available from mobiles to home appliances, users will be able to strengthen their experience (Experience).
Samsumg Electronics announced that it has integrated the CE and IM businesses and is launching a new DX business with VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, MX (Mobile Experience), and Networking as its core businesses.
The person in charge of Samsumg Electronics explained, "This name change reflects our long-term business structure and future vision, as well as global leadership enhancement."
We emphasized the idea that by providing services and solutions that reflect customer needs and optimizing the experience through various consumer products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, we can create a pleasant and enjoyable one.

What is the difference between 1500BCE and before the Common Era?
How do you say it in Japanese?
This is about the year 1500 before the Kigen era.
Before Christ (BC) means "before Christ's time" in a Christian context, but it is often used to refer to a period of time before the birth of Christ. In recent years, the abbreviation BCE (Before Common Era) has become more common in an effort to be more inclusive of non-Christian religions.
BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era (Western Era).

It has been revealed that the truck driver involved in the crash in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, which involved 24 vehicles, did not have any injuries and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is believed that the crash was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Shimokawa City, Hokkaido, and 12 people were injured.
The police first caused a traffic accident and arrested a 71-year-old man for suspected drunk driving. On the 12th, they sent the suspect, 54-year-old Noguchi Yoshikazu, for further investigation.
The suspect in the Yasuhiro Yasuda case kept walking even after his car ran out of brakes, and was found to have lost consciousness shortly after the fire department arrived.
It has been confirmed that the suspect in the Nishikawa case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching the suspect's home and investigating the current situation in detail.

The fourth chapter of the manga "Oginomama X" was reviewed! (Weekly Pocket News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympic Games began from Volume 3 and has now concluded in Volume 4!
The first chapter was filled with tension as the match progressed from the opening ceremony to the decisive final battle. Despite the focus on a single match, the story was packed with new and exciting developments.
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review Submitter Name: OginumamaX (Star 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling Begins Even Before the Match Starts!
This four-volume series was drawn with great care and attention to detail, but it would be a shame if it ended here. Therefore, it was decided to draw a volume depicting the ring match as well.
We started from the basics and gradually improved our skills in teamwork, tactics, and formations. We also trained hard to create a unique and powerful atmosphere for the match. Despite all of this, there was no guarantee of victory.
As the tension of the story slowly builds up, the reader can feel the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming battle. This feeling of suspense is heightened as the story progresses, making it more realistic and immersive.
Meanwhile, the third-place match between Teriyaki Man and Ramen Man was decided in the decisive match before the grand final.
While I was looking for a luxurious snack before the match, a guy who was selling ramen suddenly shouted to me, "From now on, I'll be the one who wins the match!"

Unfortunately, the silent but powerful Tamamori stopped the terrifying man with his sword, and the scene changed suddenly.

It's amazing how quickly time flies! I can't believe I'm already a manga creator, and I'm feeling the pain of deadlines already!

"You must never rely on just your strength! ！"
That is a lifelong struggle.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the reader, but it's still not enough for the protagonist, so he keeps pushing himself harder and harder until he finally succeeds. That's what I'm thinking.

It seems like the writer is imagining something new even though they can't see the future development of the story. Furthermore, it looks like the writer is taking a creative approach to the story, which makes it even more exciting.
This is amazing.
I think this is the most important point of the whole story.

He said it was a reference book and I should read it from cover to cover.
It is surprisingly easy to apply abstract concepts learned from high-level programming languages such as Python and Java to low-level programming languages such as C and C++.
Understanding the whole by pulling it apart into pieces.
If you understand, it's okay.
It's not right to do it out of order.
After I read the first few lines of a book, I often forget what it's about. So I have to reread the first few lines again to remind myself.
I had been reading books without practicing for a long time. So I decided to read books regularly and make consistent effort to improve my reading comprehension.

One of the most famous Japanese sweets is "Kasutera", which is made of a single sheet of gold leaf and has a unique texture. It was first created in the late 17th century by a confectioner named Kawakita Mameyama. The gold leaf is carefully cut into the shape of a tiger, and then slowly stretched and dried to create a delicate work of art.

The Place-Based Agriculture and Rural Development Council, which is composed of cities and towns as well as JA (Japan Agricultural Cooperatives), has started to utilize "Live Commerce" which is a combination of online video distribution and product sales. This enables them to promote and sell agricultural and horticultural products in an online marketplace.

Happy New Year!
It's so cute when they're in love! ❤️＼(^o^)／
This morning, I am unlucky.
The power supply for the PC used for NAS has become inaccessible. 😥😥😥😥😥
That's what happened.
Open the window for the sake of changing the air in the morning.
Power is being cut off during this time.
2.) After a while, the PC suddenly started making a pink rotator sound. I was surprised and shut the PC down immediately.
It is thought that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
I tried it one more time after warming the room.
3.) No action.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will turn on for just one moment, then it will turn off immediately.
After that, we didn't talk much.
Try it again by unplugging the power plug just for a moment.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, and try to power on the computer without any other parts connected.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles Bubbles Bubbles" has been coming from the PSU fan for a long time, but it is not the cause.
We'll try to find an ATX power supply later.
Tubun.
If you don't have a plan, it's difficult to move forward.
Can you change a case and a mother together?

The popularity of emoji has been increasing year by year. According to the latest ranking of the most used emoji in Japan, released by Gizmodo Japan, the most used emoji in 2021 was the smiling face (😆).
The character I use the most is a crying emoji.
I believe that picture characters are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there have been many applications and tools that enable users to create stamps instead of using emoticons or emojis.
Spicy, simple, no reply needed, polite element.
In the modern age, the importance of soft atmosphere is emphasized by the necessity of emoticons!
Everyone is using cute emoticons these days.
[Viewing the Entire Ranking of Picture Characters] 2021, the Most Used Picture Character Ranking 2021, Worldwide Top 10!
Positive and bright emoticons are ranking in recently.
According to the Unicode standard, 92% of the world's net population uses emoji.
The 1st place is taken by the character set with a 5% usage rate!
Even though the laughing emoticons with the first, third, and fifth places are difficult to use, they're still pretty cute, aren't they?
When it's interesting time, happy time is guaranteed, right?
Even if you don't have time, you should at least try to be polite. Even if you don't have the energy, you should at least try to be considerate. People who are inconsiderate and rude even in difficult times will become fewer and fewer.
People who have never used a top 10 emoji once are rare.
I want to try something new.
