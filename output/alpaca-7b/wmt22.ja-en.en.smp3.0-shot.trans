I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was so popular on TV.
Yesterday, I was watching Netflix in Chirori, but it was not very interesting. However, the staff suddenly started laughing behind me, which made the situation a bit awkward.
"It's not funny to make fun of a poor artist, even if he is selling nothing and is not famous. It's just sad."
Even though the staff didn't laugh, the artist's bad attitude made the workplace unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and the egos of some artists are getting in the way. It's too bad because it used to be so cool.
I can't help but feel sorry for the struggling artist when I see them working hard on their own art.
Even though income is not very much, I'm trying to make a living as an artist. It's hard work but I'm determined to make it to the top of the toppest mountain.
There is a tendency for people to become celebrities overnight and become popular on social media and other media outlets, which leads to an imbalance in the society. However, there is no proper way to address this issue.
Although there are some difficult parts in the workplace, such as dealing with office politics, artists seem to have a knack for handling it all with grace and ease.
You are so foolish.
I can't help but feel bad when I can't go outside.

You are requested to return the wireless mouse that you ordered if you want to receive a wired version instead.
The topic of self-made PCs has been a source of trouble for some time, but it is still worth considering since it is an infamous place.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse for 3,280 yen (including tax) was on sale at a tsukumo net shop on the day of the tsukumo sale.
Since the price of the same wireless version was the same at the store, I confirmed the price of the wireless version page and it was 5,071 yen (Link to Squid). Therefore, there was no misconception about the price.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipment mail also arrived normally.
The name "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the customer from the time of order until delivery, I thought it was a wireless mouse that I sent.
There was a problem from this store and it took several hours after delivery for the "registration of goods was wrong" email to come.
That's what the mail said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version.
Since we are already sending wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse and get a refund.
Use the wireless mouse as it is.
Select an appropriate response.
It has been discovered that the product page of both the wireless and wired versions have been altered, with purchases being noted in the mail, product book, and wireless version being changed without the customer's consent.

The only bridge out of the area due to the typhoon and heavy rain was washed away by the flooding. The residents had to stock up on food supplies three times as much. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shirakawa-chō, Takizawa-machi, Fukushima-ken.
The great influence of the 8-person staying in the 3rd floor room of 2019 East Japan Typhoon was felt.
Mr. Matsumoto was very excited when he first heard the song "Magical".
It was a very sad feeling when I saw the only road connecting the mountain region, the Highland Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the local community were left stranded in a desperate situation.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's great that the road goes all the way to the garden from the bus stop. You can just take the bus and then walk to the garden, or if you're too tired you can always carry the bus and then take the train over the bridge to the other side. It's nice to have so many different ways of getting there." One month after the emergency bridge was completed, it was washed away by a heavy rainstorm. For three months, the temporary bridge washed away by the rain was the only way to get to the other side.
After two years of rebuilding from the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing his efforts to provide education to the children in the affected area.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about buying a 10-case lot of beer.
We should secure enough food for two to three days, such as canned goods and instant noodles, to be prepared for any emergency.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "We don't know when disaster will strike, so it's important to have a little bit of emergency supplies and prepare for the worst. That's what I've been doing since the bridge was washed away." Meanwhile, Yamanashi-cho experienced an "unexpected disaster" and Mr. Yamanashi shared his story.
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to devise its own unique take on the matter.
The town of Kagami is planning to prepare for disasters on October 12th, the day of Kagami Festival, in the form of a memorial event. We would like to consider what kind of measures can be taken for the future.
Even though we have experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.

Experience the Paralympic Games in Virtual Reality (Tokyo MX - Yahoo! News)
Tokyo City will be able to hold the Paralympic Marathon Course Re-enactment Event digitally in 2021.
This event has opened up a new enjoyment of sports and the charm of Tokyo through digital experiences.
There were running machines and road bikes prepared at the venue and the people who visited the venue were able to recreate a marathon course by attaching special equipment. They ran marathon races in the virtual space.
Each tablet showing a virtual space will have an avatar of the participant appear, allowing for an experience of running a marathon while competing with participants from both inside and outside of Japan. Furthermore, it will be possible to enjoy sightseeing at popular tourist spots in the city.
Participants were amazed at the beautiful changes that occurred.
The Tokyo Marathon was a great experience. I enjoyed running through the city streets while taking in the sights and sounds. I especially enjoyed the atmosphere of the race, with people cheering and encouraging each other as we ran. I'm looking forward to participating in more marathons in the future, including ones outside of Tokyo. The Tokyo Marathon organizer also expressed their wish to build a sports stadium in the future so that people can continue to enjoy running and competing in marathons.

When buying a used house, be aware!
The gap between the collapse of buildings and the excavation of holes is investigated by the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News).
Towards the revitalization of the used housing market, a new system for "Building Condition Survey" has been set up. Used housing transactions have become popular.
The price of constructing a house and the market for refurbishment are both increasing.
As the number of people aiming for a house near the station has increased, the demand for high-rise buildings has grown rapidly. As a result, the price of new construction has become relatively inexpensive.
Although existing (old) housing is shared widely in Japan, the level of sharing is still low compared to overseas.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started a survey, called "Inspection" in Japanese, aimed at ensuring safe and secure used houses in 2018 (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a skilled builder who has become proficient in residential construction checks the current condition and con dition of the building and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers when it comes to introducing inspe Home » News » News » APC will win Kwara State in 2019 – Gov.

By conducting an inspection of the property before engaging in the transaction, the merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning afterward and provide the customer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been a long-standing problem in the society.
Even if you are on the buying side, you can understand the condition of used houses for purchase by grasping the system, and thus benefit from it.
On the system of the current situation, the main responsibility for the guidance of building inspection is the seller side.
It is important to pay attention to the fact that the notification of the inspection system has become obligatory at the point.
Real estate agents who take responsibility for property management, such as introducing a construction engineer to inspect the building condition, are obligated to do so. However, the actual implementation will not be obligated.
Despite the risk of being nervous during the presentation, there is a possibility of making a profit by exporting to America or the UK, where the same system has already been established.
In the preliminary stages of a real estate transaction, the buyer typically hires specialists such as inspectors and building surveyors to conduct a building inspection before signing the contract.
For example, in the case of America, roughly 70 to 90 percent of the inspe The 2018-2019 school year marks the 10th anniversary of the Sustainability Academy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. To celebrate this milestone, the Academy is hosting a series of events throughout the year.The first event, held on October 26, 2018, was a panel discussion featuring alumni of the Sustainability Academy. The panelists discussed their experiences in the Academy, how the Academy has shaped their careers, and the impact of the Academy on the UCSB and greater community. The panel was moderated by Professor Emeritus of Environmental Studies, Dr. David Hursh.The second event, held on February 21, 2019, was a celebration of the Academy's 10th Anniversary. The event featured a keynote address by Professor Emeritus of Environmental Studies, Dr. David Hursh, and a panel of current and former Academy students. The panel discussed their experiences in the Academy, how the Academy has shaped their careers
In terms of the point where the "buyer" is leading the inspection, the "seller" is the main type of Japanese inspection and its nature is quite different from the "seller" led inspection in other countries.
The landlord can often be seen inspecting the condition of the building, even if only slightly, in order to raise the rent early.
We are considering moving to a place where we can feel safe and secure.
Even if it is the same inspection, it can cause trouble if both parties have different goals and expectations.
For this reason, risks such as anxiety and stress have been pointed out regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of inspection for the sales promotion model shall not be minimized.
Since detailed survey is not possible, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing the customer's case to the third party (selling agent) is effective.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the employer does not report unfavorable survey results to the labor authorities.

Is the Silver Zone an island?
Silver Brain: 5 Essential Academic Subjects for Leisurely Conversation (LEON.JP News) - Yahoo! News
This place was a peninsula in the past.
Even if you don't understand the complicated academic stuff around that, you can still show off a bit in Ginza.
Let me introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square in Tokyo. It is quite interesting and amusing to talk to someone.
Go up to the Silver Zone!?
He entered the goldfish bowl for the first time.
As you walk through the Silver Zone, you can find mysterious places such as changing landscapes, ancient stone monuments, and numerous shrines. All of these have been carved by the history of Silver Zone.
As she walked through the streets of Tokyo, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a profound silence. She realized that she had stumbled upon an ancient ruin from the past.
Is the Silver Zone the Hakusai Peninsula?
The nickname "Ginza" for the bustling city in Japan is popular not only in Tokyo, but also in other cities such as Osaka and Fukuoka.
The Silver Mine, which was known as "Ginza" in the Edo period, was moved to present-day Tokyo from Shimotsuma in 1612 (Kenkyuu 17).
At the time, it was referred to as "Newcomer's Town" but eventually came to be known as "Ginza" due to its transfer to that town.
According to the news, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which faced the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River was filled with boats entering from the Sumida River and heading to the Tokyo Bay. The area from Kameido to the Marunouchi was filled with boats entering from the Sumida River and heading to the Tokyo Bay.
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened a bakufu in Edo and buried and constructed the Kyobashi area.
We have to rebuild our home and neighborhood, and develop water transportation, in order to improve our quality of life.
Thus, they dug up the earth and threw it away, and then they razed the Shimoda Mountain. As a result, they filled in the river and built a castle there.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store on Ginza 2-7 (Central Ginza), there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worth taking a look.
People know the "Holy Pilgrimage" of the Silver Zone in Ginza.
Silver Zone is a place where the "Silver Zone Hachiman Shrine MEGURI" is held annually. This is a sacred ritual to worship the shrine.
In the sacred grounds of a Shinto shrine, the most captivating sight is the Kabuki Theater located in front of it.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki theatre.
One side, the "Lucent Shrine" is in the lobby of the Ginza Matsuya, while the "Ginza Subterranean Shrine" is located in the Ginza 3-chome 9th floor lobby of the Ginza Terrace.
The shrines "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" and "Atsukamori Inari Shrine" are located in a corner of the street, but "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" is famous for being respected by the Geisha and the actor Nakamura Kanzaburō. The shrine "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" is located in the basement of the building "Shochiku Inarimachi Building" and is not open to the public. The shrine "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" is located in the vicinity of the shrine "Torii Inari Shrine" other than that.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian deities as well as the spirits of the land and mountains. However, most shrines only worship the gods of harvest as their main deities.
In front of the Shaden (a type of shrine) foxes would greet people and bring them good luck, so it was built in a place with many farmers to benefit from the plentiful harvests of the five grains and silk.
As it has been transformed into a bustling metropolis like Kyoto and Edo, the benefit of commercial activities has become widely recognized. Even in Japan, the Ginza and other shopping districts have become more and more vibrant, as faith has been widely spread.

The South Korean company Posco has acquired a majority stake in the Senegalese energy company Enagase, expanding its overseas gas business. This news was reported by Yahoo! News (WoW!Korea).
Posco International announced on November 12 that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement and an investment agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, aiming to acquire a stake in the two companies.
Due to the fact that various procedures such as the consent of the host company and local NGOs are still pending at the Senex Enagic Corporation's Annual General Meeting, the purchase and sale procedures are expected to be completed by March 2021.
In 2010, the acquisition of Posco by the Posco Group became the world's largest M&A case in the history of purchase and merger (M&A).

That pain in your knee, could it be "Chondromalacia Patellae"?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC - Yahoo! News)
The Editing Department: We have been suffering from pain in the knee recently.
Is there a possibility of getting such a disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of the pain in the knee joint can be various, such as knee joint inflammation, ligament and tendon tears, and overuse injuries.
In Japan, it is very common for people to have "joint contracture disorder".
Is it possible that the editing team will be affected by the changes in the schedule?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Our job is to cover the surface of the joints with soft tissues and to make the impact gentle, as well as to smoothly move the joints.
Taking part in activities such as aging, overeating, and strenuous sports can cause the soft tissues to become loose and deformed.
As a result, it can cause joint deformities and inflammations.
Does knee joint pain often occur in addition to foot pain?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Even outside the knee, there are joints and tendons of the fingers, wrist, elbow, rib cage, hip, and ankle which can cause pain.
However, the most common case is a foot case, called "Foot Sprain".
What is the structure of a joint like?
Mr. Maruyama: The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are irregularly arranged.
Therefore, the part that is covered by this 2-book set is the "joint soft tissue", and the surrounding area is "joint capsule" which is covered by the set.
The editorial team is complicated and structured.
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
There is a layer of lubricating tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule. It produces synovial fluid to lubricate the joint.
This synovial fluid performs a lubricating role, and is composed of hyaluronate and condrocyte sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joint smoothly requires a combination of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms can transformation joint disease cause?
Mr. Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of lubrication, so it is important for joints to be flexible and not stick to each other.
Iwaba is a role like a maid in a cafe.
If you are constantly straining your muscles, it can cause joint deformities, inflammations, and pain.

12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win the prize money, but the steel bones are only 4 in number, which makes the safety measures insufficient and the death possibility quite high.

The store of the brand "Cotto" (Kotori) is about 1 meter long, and has a more compact size feeling compared to general items.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I make something this short and twisty?"
When you look at it for a while, you can make a long, thin, evenly cut piece of cloth by folding it once and attaching it to a single point. The whole thing looks like a web.
The ends of the web are connected to each other so that the store can pass through.

Even though we were about to be scattered, we still had fun together. But it was all too dramatic and soon it was time to go.
While working hard, I suddenly realized I knew what Paul and George were talking about! It was amazing! I was so surprised that I couldn't help but laugh. I was so caught off guard that it felt like time had stopped. I was so amazed by what I had just realized that I couldn't help but smile.
That's so irritating, the constant bickering and arguing. But then I realized it was just the atmosphere, so I started to laugh. It was so silly, like the Beetles were arguing. That's when I realized it was a legendary reunion.
Everyone really starts to play in that special atmosphere.
We were walking together and one of us said, "What a drag it is!" Then we started singing "That's Amore" and the whole thing became so much fun.

Since the documentary also provides an explanation for the director's cut of the movie, it's impossible to ignore the feeling that Peter Jackson must have had when he saw it.
Because Paul is taking care of the garden, there are many scenes of him being nice to the plants.

I'll just have to survive this little while.
I had to change my job because I was too sick to work. But I wanted to keep doing something related to business, so I decided to switch to a different industry. It was difficult to find a job that suited me, but I'm so glad I was able to find something I'm passionate about.
I was able to find some things that I could do despite the fact that I couldn't do anything. I was able to find little things that were helpful and I was able to discover that my future lifestyle will be more enjoyable.
Considering this deeply can be tiring, so it's best to take a break and let your mind wander.
It is possible to consult a company doctor or a labor-management consultant at the window of the company. There is also a system of consultation at the window of the company, so it is thought to be better to consult once.
Even if life is a bit boring now, it will be fun later on.

In America, a large number of tornadoes have caused severe damage to crops and livestock, as well as a cold and snowy winter (Weather News).
A typhoon with multiple spiral arms has developed over the American Southwest from the 10th to 11th days of the local time.
As a result of strong cold air from the south below, the atmosphere became extremely unstable and precipitation clouds developed rapidly.
A warm and muggy air mass from the southwestern United States has been pouring into the southern part of the country, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both days, Monday and Friday.
In a place where it was record-breakingly warm, a strong cold air from the sky 5500m below suddenly descended and formed an active front, resulting in a rapid development of the clouds in the shape of a line along the front.
It was rumored that the dragon eggs were hatching one after another in the outskirts of the village.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage decreases significantly from the summer to the fall.
The warning issued in winter which was announced on the same day has reached 150 times nearer than before. It was recorded in great amount.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States has reportedly received over 400 reports of typhoons and tornadoes in just 10 days (Friday).
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the south and north of the United States that are concentrated along the lines of the former Texas and Kansas states. The area in the south includes the state of Illinois.
In the EF Scale in Kanto, the strength of the dragon's roar was demonstrated, reaching EF3 at the third strongest person out of 6 stages. Immediately afterwards, a gust of 70m/s before and after was observed.
By surveying the damage from the storm, it is possible to determine whether it is an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese Version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the situation of Japanese buildings based on the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of JEF3 infection in America is high enough to cause considerable damage, such as the destruction of wooden buildings.

CNN and other American media outlets reported it.
Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the loss of life.
The fear of death has surpassed 100 people.
In KenTucky State, where people were affected by the tornado, they had to move housewares such as furniture and utensils from the damaged houses to the safe place during the night from 10th to 11th. The tornadoes in KenTucky State and other states have already exceeded 30.
According to records, the 1925 Mizoram tornado caused damage over a 219-mile (350-kilometer) stretch of land, but meteorologist Brandon Miller of CNN estimated the maximum intensity of this tornado to be 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In the wake of the devastating floods in KenTucky, the Mayfield Christmas Shopping Festival was forced to operate in a 24-hour state of emergency, resulting in a massive damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were also erased.
A woman who was unable to move her legs due to the thickness of the darkness beneath the gurney felt the weight of the rescue worker as he searched for her above the gurney on the live broadcast from her smartphone and facebook.
Besides the woman's cry for help that could be heard in the public broadcasted live, there was also the terrified singing of another woman that was heard through her sobbing. This was the singing of "Happi Birthday To You", which was heard in the background.
An employee of a convenience store located in Meifield, named Barbara Brown, was found hiding in the basement of her house along with her 5-year-old child after the earthquake warning was issued. She was unharmed.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a terrifying sound like the roar of the sea.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "The search activity will be stopped until further notice."
We don't know how long it will take, how many months, or how many years it will take to find out. But we continue to do our best with our helpless but determined rescue activities.
In Ilinoi State, a warehouse of the internet shopping giant Amazon collapsed and at least 6 people were confirmed dead.
The shockwaves from the train car being detached are so strong that even the fences and barriers have been sealed off due to the impacts of accidents such as derailment of the high-speed road.
According to media reports, over 40 million people in the U.S. are without power due to the effects of the earthquake in Japan.

It is an old saying that approaches to evaluation systems of star charts are different from each other.
Other countries are arguing to reduce their points based on 5 stars, while Japan is arguing to increase their points by adding/reducing stars.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, but four stars become "deficient element" and "excellent work" in different meanings.
When judging a work by five stars, if the work is perfect in every aspect, it will be classified as "the highest standard work" and will be awarded all five stars. However, if the work is lacking in any aspect, it will be judged as "deficient work" and will only be awarded three stars. Therefore, I think it is better not to present the concept of stars on the system level.

A family's long journey of environmental protection in China's rural areas (JBpress).
(Katou Yasuji: Find Asia Companies) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, and the species of mammals that live there are the world's first, while the species of plants are the world's third.
We recognize the value of biodiversity as proclaimed by the self-governing body, and not only do the self-governing body perform environmental protection, but also actively promote environmental activities by the local people.
The province of Sichuan in China's southwestern region is one of the regions in the country.
The area around the city of Sa Pa in Lao Cai province, Vietnam, is home to the Lao and the Hmong people, who share the same culture and language. It is also the ancestral home of the Tai (Tai Yuan) people, who are one of the 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam.
The source of the Mekong River is flowing through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Sihao people (Western Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) is an autonomous prefecture of China, with an area of only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wildlife species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, I visited the Shisapannan Environmental Protection Activity with Mr. Li Xuncai, and had a talk with him about the content of the activity.
A German man and his wife have started a environmental protection activity together. They have started this activity for the last 20 years.
What was that noise?
Mr. Li has been leading our environmental protection activities, "Tenchō", since 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This place is the only tropical rainy forest in China, and it boasts a great biodiversity.
Despite that, the economic growth has been slowing down.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, we had to import rubber from China, which was in short supply due to the previous hot-climate rainforest harvesting.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
Then, I was married to the journalist here.
Was Mr. Li interested in nature protection before?
My father is from Shimane Prefecture, but I am not interested in the meaning of the term "heat-tolerant rainforest" or its biological diversity.
We have become accustomed to advancing the project without knowledge or experience.
Even though there was no one special behind it, I was able to see a lot of people's faces from the top of the hill. Why was that?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.
In that brief moment of confidence, I stepped into the natural world.
That person is definitely convinced of their own strength and is holding on to it firmly within their heart.

I think it's interesting to talk about what people are wearing, but it's even better if their clothes are colorful.
Is it okay if it's a bit small?
Even though it's visible, it's still a mystery.
I think about how beautiful it is.
It seems like there is no meaning behind the fact that people are always talking.
Did you brush your teeth carefully?
If you confessed to the police at the crime scene, what would happen?
I confessed to my crush and my heart is overflowing with joy. I hope we can be friends.
Then, let's join together and increase our knowledge of golf, and share our mutual interests.

Although I am not retired yet, I often think of the limits of retirement.
I am thinking about the importance of spiritual care visiting nurses - today's visiting nurses have ended.
Because I am suffering from dual-diagnosis, I have been taking long-term counseling and visiting nurses for a long time. However, I am very happy to have formed a good relationship with the nurse at the visiting nursing station. She is very kind and patient with me.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and other related matters (such as dressings), it is more important for those with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which I thought was important in today's visiting nursing.
We had a discussion about gender differences today, and it was quite interesting. We even had a debate about gender theory. It was quite amusing.
We can talk about our sexual desires, why she left her husband, and such topics during visitations. It would be interesting, don't you think?
Although I am wearing a tamagotchi, I am actually a girl.
When I visited a nursing home to give a spiritual care, I couldn't find any nurses to help me with the practical work. Instead, I was told by the staff that "This place is about medical care, so we don't do anything like that here." I heard this story from a friend.
I am using the social welfare system to visit a small visiting nursing station, but I am grateful for the kindness of the nurse, who is treating me with respect. I think she is a good nurse.
You are so beautiful.
Both those who are receiving psychiatric care and those who are considering it should be mindful.
Visiting a nursing home is very meaningful for people with mental and physical illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good nursing station for our travel.

The Japanese technology of Hydrogen Economy and the Chinese Five Year Plan of Hydrogen Economy have been delayed due to the financial crisis. (Central China News Japanese Language Edition)
The Japanese government announced the Hydrogen Economy Load Map in 2019.
From 2022, we aim to popularize 6000 units of hydrogen vehicles and to operate 310 stations across the nation.
The target price of hydrogen per kilogram was 6,000 yen (approximately 577 yen).
Unfortunately, the target of 27% for fuel cell vehicles in the 2011 fiscal year has not been met yet. (Approximately 1700 units)
The percentage of hydrogen stations in Japan has reached 38% (approximately 117 locations), and the difference in hydrogen price and loading map announcement at the time is not significant.
It has been found that the loadmap of water resources for the government is far below the target value.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) announced a report titled "Status and Policy Directions of Hydrogen Economy System" on November 12.
According to reports, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mainly dependent on the United States and Japan. This is the actual situation.
The core material of the lithium-ion battery of the automobile is carbon fiber from Toho (Japan), platinum catalyst from Kyocera (Japan), menbrane from DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA) etc.
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, are leading the world market for hydrogen technology patent applications, with an average growth rate of 14% per year since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of water production and fuel cells in Japan (2014-2020 cumulative), Korea is the fifth in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has been dominated by six countries, which is the reality of the water element market.
The order of patent application filing in Japan, China, the United States, and Europe is China, the United States, Japan, and Europe.
In 2017, China overtook the US to become the largest economy in the world. Since then, it has been expanding the gap between the two economies.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) ranked 4th, but China (4721 cases) was 22% higher than the standard.
The Japanese government should specify the "National Strategy Technology" as a target for investment and development of hydrogen technology.

Is it okay to ask for money during volunteer activities?

For example, when someone needs medical treatment, charity is shown by offering gratitude in the form of a donation.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine to support its military forces in their training, according to CNN.co.jp.
The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine reported on December 12th that weapons, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine as part of the assistance plan that was approved by the Ukrainian government.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million dollars (approximately 68 billion yen). Lastly, a radar system consisting of four bases to identify launching sites of artillery such as rocket launchers is being transported to Ukraine.
According to the Caribbean News Agency, these weapons of mass destruction also included combat vehicles such as tanks and missiles.
The purpose of the Russian military presence in Ukraine's border areas is to boost its military power and strengthen its national defense capabilities.
The U.S. is warning Russia to keep its movement, and is negotiating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and Ukraine to respond to the possible Russian invasion.
The Baiden Great Leader had agreed to accept weapons assistance from Ukraine's Zelensky Great Leader when he visited the White House on September 1, 2020.
Military assistance from the United States to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of approximately 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, resulting in an increase of over 25 billion dollars in aid.

The LDP and Komeito have been pushing for a bill to banish handouts and donations to political parties, and the bill has been met with strong opposition from the ruling coalition. The bill has been seen as a way to weaken the power of the opposition, and the DPJ and other opposition parties have been protesting the bill. In response, the LDP and Komeito have been pushing for the bill to be passed quickly, and have even gone as far as to call for a snap election if necessary.

In the discussion of the integration of consumption tax and corporate tax, there was a sense of unease in 2022 Tax Reform, but it is likely that pre-emptive gifts will be restricted in the future.
How do the rules of etiquette change with different cultures?
The Basic Techniques of Taxation and Its Application to Tax Reduction.
(Diamond Editing Department, Miyamura Takashi)
In order to utilize pre-emptive donations to companies from the asset-rich families, the government should consider the following measures from the perspective of taxation: (1) Clarifying the criteria for taxation of pre-emptive donations and taxation of income from donations. (2) Establishing a neutral tax system that takes into account the timing of asset transfers. (3) Conducting a thorough examination of the potential effects of taxation on asset transfers.
The 2021 Tax Reform Proposal announced by the ruling party last year has generated a huge wave of movement across all social classes in Japan.
If we do not follow the rules of continuity, such as increasing the rate of taxation, it will lead to a great increase in the rate of taxation. This is because the meaning of "pre-tax contributions" is to increase taxation.
The steel rule for taxing high-income earners is to reduce their taxable income by taxing their wealth.
The pre-retirement gift-giving custom among asset owners, such as those in the three major metropolitan areas, has been widely utilized even though it is a small-scale tax.
Discussion on the integration of the consumption tax and donations tax.
On December 10th, the 22nd Annual Tax Reform was announced. The announcement clarified the status of the current law, such as the taxation of inheritance and gifts, as well as the exemption of non-taxable income. It also stated that the system of inheritance and gift taxes is not meant to impose any additional burden on the family's transfer of assets, and that it is an ongoing effort to reform the tax system.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Audit, Mr. Kamiyama, were speaking.
Making full use of the timing of asset transfers and avoiding losses is the most important thing.
"It is a problem that arises from the integration by the simulation. The chance to offer the precious gift is three times left."

The team that won 3 matches in a row in the NFL felt various emotions (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News)
This match, John's throw was caught by the Patterson's pass. It was only caught 3 times.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season when the Dallas Cowboys played the New York Giants in the infamous "Battle of the Boroughs". It was the second time in a row that the Cowboys had won the match.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, the first running back to ever rush for over 2000 yards, played for the Buffalo Bills.
The Builders were defeated by the Simpson and the one-man RB gym Blackstone in a weightlifting competition.
The reason for the maximum offensive deployed by the PaytonRottweilers was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains geographically close to the North Pacific Ocean.
This day was almost the same as the day before, with a temperature of around 1 degree Celsi Home » News » News » Celebrating 10 years of the African UnionCelebrating 10 years of the African UnionThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the African Union (AU). Founded in 2002, the AU is a continental union of 54 countries in Africa, which seeks to promote unity and solidarity among African countries, and to promote the socio-economic development of the continent. The AU has achieved significant progress in the last decade, including the adoption of the African Union Constitutive Act in 2007, which established the African Union Commission and outlined the AU’s core objectives and functions. The AU has also achieved significant progress in the areas of peace and security, economic integration, and political and social cohesion.The AU has also been instrumental in addressing the Ebola crisis in West Africa, as well as in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism in the region.

The buildings were only changed locally, and there was no major change in the selection of players.
For every 30 passes, the run should be 25 times.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
Interception was impossible, and we couldn't decide what to do next.
There were 4 Red Zone invasions in the Offensive Series.
After the third quarter, we continued to run all the way to the red zone.
Although I only won 3 points in the 3rd round of FG1, I still didn't give up.
The defense before the last board of the match.
The buildings were chasing the 4 points at 3rd & 9th and changed to 3rd & 14th.
The distance from the goal is 18 yards.
On the third and 14th, the QB All-Star was surrounded by a rush of lassitude from the pocket and flowed right out of the pocket.
So I threw a pass at the endzone to try to catch the td but it failed.
At the end of this race, Esperanza Wrstefon Diggs had just managed to sprint past the finish line, but she couldn't find her way out of the arena.
Arlen Harris, the WR Gabriel Dumont, had been stalking from the left sideline, but his pass was tipped in front of the end zone by Payton Pritchard's DB Miles Brian, resulting in a failed attempt.
Brian had been working on a WRC project in the buildings, but he stopped to watch the movements of the people in the middle of the way and released the beezy. He then reacted to the pass.
Allen threw two Endorses in order to pass the Reshiram and Zekrom.
We couldn't decide whether to take a 4th down or not, but there was no need to take a 3rd down.
It is possible to win a first down in two attempts of a play.
Since I was already at the 2 Minute Warning sign before the 4th & Short, I decided to call my own run and the short-yardage ability of the offense came through.

Translation: 3 items to make your kitchen more organized and stylish - Harper's BAZAAR (Hāpāruz Bazā)
Sponge
Even if you frequently change the sponge, it will eventually become dirty again.
From the research of 2017, it has been found that kitchen sponges can be effectively killed with an electronic sanitizer (although it is still preferable to sanitize them with an electronic sanitizer). Furthermore, it has been revealed that bacteria can reproduce in abundance even when sanitized with an electronic sanitizer.
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends exchanging a clean sponge once a week for 1 week.
Manabu
The United States Department of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to repair and replace damaged and worn-out equipment as soon as possible.
When microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi proliferate in a dirty environment, it becomes difficult to keep the environment clean. This is because the microorganisms have a tendency to rapidly reproduce in such an environment.
If you are still a big man, then pour 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water into a table spoon of undiluted liquid bleach and frequently shake it to forget about it.
Immerse a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.

This function can be used to commit fraud such as stealing money and goods without being caught.
That is not possible.

Do you want to talk about the difference between job and employment?
I don't understand why you keep talking about the same thing.

In Japan, it is.
There is no connection between the Gajin Wind and the Kanji.
It's better to talk early than to remain silent, right? "Why do you keep quiet/stay silent?"
Why did you become so unhappy without any relation with foreigners? You just got angry easily.
I'm so frustrated with the low probability of success. I can't even dream of success.
Even though I had been living overseas, I still felt a sense of belonging to Japan. I was surprised when I encountered people who were so intolerant of other cultures.
If you appear to be a Westerner, there is no need to be concerned about having an evil spirit. Just be yourself and you will be fine.
If my friends were from Europe or America, I would be talking in English. But since they're Japanese, I end up talking in broken Japanese for a bit before switching to English.
If you're friends with someone from Japan, they'll probably be really nice to you.
Although the Japanese language is very pure and simple, it is difficult to understand if you don't pay attention. That's why it's important to be mindful of the exceptions when handling it.
Even if you speak the Japanese language, you won't understand the Japanese culture if you don't respect their rules.
Even though he had no relation with them, he always raised his glass higher than others at the drinking party.
I think it's amazing how Japanese people have such unique customs and habits. For example, when you greet someone, you bow even if you're the same age or younger. When you leave, you bow even if you're the same age or older. It's so strange yet so cool.
Japanese people are known for their unique and delicate sense of beauty. Even bizarre things like watching ants can be seen as beautiful by them.

Since I have only a limited ability to understand English, I will judge the text that has been translated only by its content.
The translated text gives a slightly awkward feeling, but it is understandable and there is no level restriction when playing (I felt this way, but I also tried it out for other people).
This translation of a game made outside of Japan has been accurately localized, even though it is a small company.
Can people who don't speak Japanese well understand the subtle differences between the two languages?
I don't know what level you are trying to reach, but if Japanese people are not bothered by the feeling of discomfort when trying to reach a level that is not their own, then it is good to explore other people.

There are various reasons why people want to have a place of their own to relax. Some people want to have a place to call their own, while others want a place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Some people may want a place to pursue their hobbies, while others may want a place to relax and unwind. It depends on the individual.

The exchange of hard work for equality in "Ugokoku Monogatari" (The Tale of the Grave) is a song by <Anime "Ugokoku Monogatari" Beginning Commemoration>. (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
In recent manga, the blade of "Exorcism" was found to be different from the usual. It was said to be "The work of a master craftsman".
There is no battle in Daikanyama, but it is popular among readers. The shop is known for its relaxing atmosphere, even during the day and night. It is also famous for its unique workshops, such as sword polishing and leather crafting.
It took two years of hard work to become like that, but it was all worth it since it was so fun to draw.
There is a mysterious charm to the exotic landscape of the place where the ancient ruins of the temple can be found. However, there is also the fact that staying in the same location for too long can lead to a lack of variety.
After the main character, Ashitaka, had completed his training with the sword of the demon slayer, he knelt down before the great warrior San, and offered him his own life in exchange for the life of the human princess, Princess Mononoke. It was from this moment that the great warrior San began to speak of taking the rights of life and death from others.

Initiation and the journey of growth from the imagination.
We went to the mountain in the fog, following the man who had not completed his training, and reached the summit by dawn. Along the way, we encountered a river of fire and a waterfall of sparks.
Before entering the mountain to perform a ritual, make sure to prepare an offering of stones, sticks, and ropes to appease the spirits.
Despite the intense stench of the rotting corpse of the witch Wana, the person was able to work with their hands and correct her mistakes with the help of their nose. They avoided the witch's curse by doing so.
Even though it was a sudden attack, he was able to avoid it completely by raising his body strength suddenly! He was so amazed that he couldn't help but exclaim, "It's amazing how powerful I've become!"
Suddenly, people who were ordinary became strong without knowing why and woke up. It is possible to use the power and technique they have been polishing until now in a natural way.
People who have put in hard work deserve to be rewarded, but putting in effort without any results is a waste of time. The concept of "equal exchange of labor" is based on the superhuman power of extraordinary people, not on the praise of the weak. This rule is difficult to follow.

Following Samsumg's integration of the CE and IM businesses, the company has decided to call it the DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect it in the organizational changes to be made by the end of the year. The announcement was made on the 12th.
Through various services available from mobiles to home appliances, users will be able to strengthen their experience (Experience).
Samsumg Electronics announced that it has integrated the CE and IM businesses and is launching a new DX business with VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, MX (Mobile Experience), and Networking as its core businesses.

24-Carriage Rolling Confrontation: Tram Driver Uninjured, Unaware (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the operator of the truck involved in the crash in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, that caused a stir was not injured, but rather was caused by some kind of negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and rental cars collided on National Road 41 in Mabashi, Osaka, and 12 people were injured in the accident.
The police first caused a traffic accident and arrested a 71-year-old man for suspicion of drunk driving. On the 12th, they sent the suspect, 54-year-old Noguchi Takayuki, for further investigation.
The suspect in the Yamanouchi incident was apprehended by police after he had continued walking without stopping for more than 10 minutes even after the accident. It was confirmed that he had lost consciousness temporarily.
Unfortunately, it has been revealed that the suspect in the Nishikawa case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are conducting a thorough search of the crime scene and investigating the current situation in detail.

A review of the manga "Oginomama X" [Weekly News]. - Yahoo! News.
The 20th Superhuman Olympic Games began from Volume 3 and has now concluded in Volume 4!
The first chapter was filled with tension as the match progressed from the opening ceremony to the decisive final battle. Despite the focus on a single match, the story was packed with new and exciting developments.
●"Kin-Kin Man" 4-Volume Review Submission by OginanuMX (Star 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling Begins Even Before the Match Starts!
This four-volume series was drawn with great care and attention to detail, but it's not like we can just stop here. We still have the ring match to draw!
After beginning from a sumo wrestling or a special training scene, the story has changed a lot since then. We can't just give up on the match, even if it means showing our weakness.
As the tension gradually built up during the writing process, the reader could almost feel the excitement of the upcoming battle.
Then, the thrilling final match between the Teriyaki Man and the Ramen Man was decided in the third place playoff.
While I was looking for something special as a battle card, my favorite lame-duck-turned-poster-boy for the match said, "From now on, it's my turn to shine!!"
Trying to make a pop sound with a drum.
Unfortunately, the silent but powerful Tamamori stopped the terrifying man with his sword, and the scene changed suddenly.
This is the last chance to fight against the powerful Kinnikuman inside the tournament. There is no opportunity left to surrender.
Despite that horrible chicken, I'm still hungry.
If you can see such a future, you won't be able to resist imagining it!
It's amazing how quickly time flies! I can't believe I'm already a manga creator, and I'm feeling the pain of deadlines already!
Although the fight between those two was short, it still left a mark. The ring announcer's plea for justice after the match was that of a man who had been crying for his lunch.
"You must never rely on just your strength! ！"
That is a lifelong struggle.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the reader and the protagonist, so there's no need to force it anymore. I think I'm starting to understand why the protagonist is so powerful.
By making this speech, the teacher was able to scold the students without using her hands.
Readers will ask "Isn't it impossible to defeat a powerful opponent like Kin with just bare hands?"
What's going on? 」
It seems like the writer is standing in the same spot, imagining something new and looking at the work of the teacher as if to say, "Here is a lifelong challenge to bind yourself with your own chains."
This is amazing.
I think the biggest point of this volume is that there is no such thing as an error.

The FBC Fuji Television will be holding a winter illumination event at the Koyamae Mountain in Fukui Prefecture (Japan) on the weekend of December 22nd and 23rd.
At the base of the mountain in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, the first winter illumination of the season is beginning to take shape. The garden is bathed in a beautiful light.
The illumination of winter, which started on November 26th, features a 20-meter-high Christmas tree and is decorated with pathways and flower beds, with 500,000 LED lights scattered throughout the area.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture have been coming to Fukui Prefecture for a long time and have been surprised to find such a wonderful place.

When I was reading a book, suddenly my friend came and started talking to me. I tried to ignore him, but he kept talking and talking. Then I realized that he was trying to tell me something important. He said that he had found a great book about Linux and wanted me to take a look at it. He said it was a reference book and I should read it from cover to cover.
It is easier to learn from high abstraction level things such as Docker than from Linux.

This morning, I am unlucky.
The power supply for the PC used for NAS has become inaccessible. 😥😥😥😥😥
That happened.
Open the window for the sake of changing the air in the morning.
Power is being cut off during this time.
2.) After a while, the PC's pink-colored fan starts to sound. I'm getting used to it little by little.
It is considered that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6 °C).
I tried it one more time after warming the room.
3.) No action.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will blink once and then stop immediately.
After that, we didn't talk much.
I tried plugging in the power plug again, but it didn't work.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, and then try to power on the computer.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles Bubbles Bubbles" has been coming from the PSU fan for a long time, but it is not the cause.
We will try to find an ATX power supply after the post.

The popularity of emoji has been increasing significantly in Japan, and a ranking of the most used emoji in 2021 has been released.
The character I use the most is a crying emoji.
I believe that picture characters are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there have been many applications and tools that allow users to create stamps instead of using emoticons or emoji.
Spicy, simple, no reply needed, polite element.
In the modern age, it is important to preserve a gentle atmosphere with soft characters!
Everyone is using cute emoticons these days.
[Viewing the Entire Ranking of Picture Characters] 2021, The Most Used Picture Character Ranking in the World!
Positive and bright emoticons are ranking in widely.
According to the Unicode Standard, 92% of the world's net population is using emoticons.
The most popular character is 5% of the total characters!
Even though the laughing emoticons with the first, third, and fifth places are difficult to use, they're still pretty cute, aren't they?
When it's fun time, happy time is always great!
Even if you don't have time, you have to make an effort... Even if you don't have the motivation, you have to act selfishly in those moments... It's impossible for such people to become few in number.
People who have never used a top 10 emoji once are rare.
I want to try something new.
