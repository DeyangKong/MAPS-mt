The students of Zhejiang University performed at the annual meeting of the university and showed their research achievements, which made people amazed.
Using air to wash hands, smelling the air to diagnose diseases, and carefully searching for the source of the mist were presented at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these fruits are students, covering a wide range of research areas such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students have started from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical values, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The biomedical engineering team of the university displayed a biometric sensor attached to a smartphone at the exhibition. The sensor was half the size of a regular smartphone.
All you need to do is take a deep breath, and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of your breath.
Zhang Dingyi described how the sensor and smartphone were connected, and when gas was detected, a health report would be displayed on the phone.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market. Common physical parameters that can be detected include temperature and heart rate.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as stone and clay, to detect chemical elements. Its sensitive "feel" allows it to go deeper and more accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Smart Surgical Light: A Surgeon's High-Tech Magnifying Glass
In addition to smartphones, the operating room has also started to use smart surgical lamps.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition.
Zhu Lin and her team from the Institute of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new perspective in traditional surgical lighting by inventing a Smart LED Surgical Light.
Many diseases can be detected in the early stage and removed timely, and there is a relationship between the light used in the doctor's office and the surgery.
If doctors cannot identify and remove all tumor tissues in time during the early diagnosis of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has four light pads, adjusting the light spectrum to enh Home ¬ª News ¬ª News ¬ª 2018 ¬ª New Public Artwork Unveiled at the Historic CourthouseNew Public Artwork Unveiled at the Historic CourthouseThe City of Woodbury is pleased to unveil a new public artwork at the Historic Courthouse. The artwork, titled ‚ÄúThe Woodbury Story,‚Äù was created by local artist and Woodbury resident, David Hutchinson. The artwork is a 3-dimensional sculpture made from recycled materials that tells the story of Woodbury‚Äôs history and growth. The sculpture is located on the east side of the Courthouse and is visible from the street.The artwork was funded by the Woodbury Arts Commission and the City of Woodbury. The Arts Commission is a volunteer group that works to promote and support the arts in Woodbury. The Commission is responsible for selecting and approving public art projects, as well as providing grants to support local artistic endeavors.The City of Woodbury is proud to have this new public artwork as a part of its community.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and the patient's habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash hands: Saving water and feeling cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with a towel, squeezing out the handkerchief, and Li Qui Zhang and his classmates invented a set of "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the device for washing hands, our body weight can be compressed and the air can be sucked out.
He was like a person playing a wind instrument.
The compressed air that was released formed a fluid and combined with the water at the Dragon's Head.
That's great, we can finally get our hands clean and dry!
The results of the experiment showed that the effect of the experiment was the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure cleanlin Home ¬ª News ¬ª News ¬ª 2017 ¬ª Have Your Say On The Future Of Health And Social Care In Northern IrelandHave Your Say On The Future Of Health And Social Care In Northern IrelandThe Department of Health is inviting people to have their say on the future of health and social care in Northern Ireland.The consultation, which runs until 22nd November, will look at how health and social care services can be improved to meet the needs of people in Northern Ireland.The consultation will focus on a range of topics including:‚Ä¢ How to ensure that health and social care services are joined up and accessible to people‚Ä¢ How to ensure that services are provided in a safe and effective way‚Ä¢ How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is responsive to people‚Äôs needs‚Ä¢ How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is sustainable‚Ä¢ How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is person-centred‚Ä¢ How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is equitable‚Ä¢ How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is cost

That's annoying.
It felt very meaningful to hold that one piece of identification‚Äî‚Äîa rescue certificate.
This is one of the important skills certificates I feel is necessary besides a driving license!
Emergency measures should be taken as soon as possible. This is to prepare for and respond to unexpected events, such as a rescue operation before the arrival of the rescue vehicle.
During the process of rescuing the car after the accident, there was still a period of time, which was the most critical.
This is the time when we need urgent rescue.
If I really had a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, our window of life would be only four minutes, gold four minutes!
Therefore, the people around you are so important!
When there is someone who falls down beside us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of just standing there doing nothing. This helpless feeling is too frightening.
In China, there are about 300 million people who die from unexpected deaths every year, which is the most dangerous one called sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, 15% of the population is able to be rescued.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, you can survive up to 78%, with less than 1% chance of failure in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is the first reaction of Lu Le, the founder of the company.
If a person suffers from cardiac arrest, their breathing and heartbeat will stop, as will their circulation and respiration. In this situation, CPR is useless.
We must do artificial respiration and external compression in order to possibly save a person.
I discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of mindset to learn emergency rescue quickly, but when the situation happens, they come too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to go and learn this skill, so that we can make timely reaction in the face of emergency.
Even if the situation is unstable, we can still save a person's life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross center. I am registered at the Red Cross center in Zhuhai and I have a discount. Students also have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of what I wanted to accomplish when I was 25 years old. Adding an emergency rescue certificate to the list of goals was several months before, but it was really accomplished!
After I had finished applying for the other exams I wanted to take, I decided to apply for a diving certificate. I had seen in the Little Red Book that there was also a diving rescue certificate, so I thought it might be useful to have. In the end, having the diving rescue certificate proved to be very helpful when it came to taking the exam!
I have ordered #NUMBER#
There's only one 13-yuan shrimp dumpling in the whole place!?
I haven't tried it yet.
How can I #NAME# without writing it clearly?
How much is it?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# lost some food items, so I had to make up for it with a plate of dumplings! ü§§
Because I saw the code was valid before I input it.
First, I will talk about the conclusion. I believe 'The Four Seasons' is a film that can be appreciated from all angles. From various perspectives, it is a masterpiece.
But you have to say this movie is not a bright spot and it's not even the least bit enjoyable.
There are many kinds of popcorn in the cinema, allowing you to fall asleep peacefully after watching the movie. It also fills you with resentment afterward, just like the monkey on the mountain of „ÄäFour Seas„Äã. It can use innumerable ways to ignite your rage.
On this point, Han Cang really is a heaven-sent gentleman.
The most painful part of the film was the one that was a replica of a creature from the "Kingdom" series of novels, with its body covered in holes and its clothes resembling a windbreaker.
After you finish watching it, you will be left with a feeling of doubt whether there is a hidden message in the movie. However, when you think about it carefully, it turns out to be just a joke.
I found it difficult to understand some of the simpler scenes.
The man's hometown should be located in the south, and he should live with his wife according to the customs of the place.
She wished to go and see the snow in the east. So, her big uncle arranged for a car to take her to the east and she was able to see the snow.
Are old people in China allowed to sit in the back of the bus to see the snow in the south and the east?
He and his father were very relaxed.
After that, this old man didn't have any more text to read.
How did the female owner get the business license to operate a bar on a abandoned boat?
Why did the Flying Car Party manage to finish the mountain road so quickly?
Then the car stopped at the side of the road. The four drivers of the car searched around but couldn't find it.
This item is too obvious.
Why did the illegal and suspicious party become a police informant?
Why didn't the police report the high-interest loan? There was a special scene in the movie where the police asked whether there was any difficulty.
A grown man can't even use a smartphone, yet he doesn't know how to use a room key to open the door of a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel's staff and sleeps outside the door of the room?
This kind of mysterious plot twists can be found in the entire movie, and since they are too bizarre to be believed, I always feel painful when I recall them.
Besides the plot, the main theme of the movie was also disappointing. It was like a shallow collage of uninteresting and annoying scenes.
You will think of a funny movie when you see the beginning of the video, but after 20 minutes you might think it's a motivational movie. After watching half of it, you might think it's a movie to show the struggles of young people in the rural area to survive. Finally, you will be confused and wonder why you watched it.
Most people are familiar with various kinds of movies, such as car chase scenes, even though they may not realize it. For example, if you want to make a movie about a character who is trying to achieve their dreams, you can tell the audience a story filled with both determination and humor, and then show them a cute bird that takes small steps towards success.
If you want to take a love scene, then you just need to be realistic and talk about the frustration between the young people and the service staff in the small town.
If you want to reflect reality, then the most important thing is to avoid unrealistic elements in your story.
(For example, the actor playing the role of Zhang Xiao in the musical "The Last Emperor" was burned and still managed to sing.) In this case, you can't help but be fascinated by the mysterious brain disease.
Although she was playing the role of a 5-year-old child, she was able to display her intelligence and charm in certain aspects. I don't know if it was due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I was also confused, why did Han Cang become so passionate about adding a car crash scene to his own movie?
Such arrangements for the movie are stored in the Spring Festival, is it to give the audience a hard time?

The advantages of using hollow concrete blocks in constructing wells are as follows: the four sides of the blocks are uneven and irregular, forming a stepped structure; the blocks are combined with brick walls to form a chain-linked lock.
The brick-and-mortar structure of a wall is far superior to that of a slab in terms of anti-seismic performance.
The module is composed of hollow structure, connecting the vertical and horizontal holes, then filling the holes with concrete and forming a net-like structure. It serves as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is equipped with both longitudinal and transverse reinforcements, which can increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition to using concrete to check the foundation of the well and the drainage well, which is easy to cause settlement, subsidence and leakage of water, the wall and the module of the machine is stable, simple operation and standard size.
This equipment is used to check the soil, adjust the drilling module, and operate the intelligent control of the data input and output, touch screen, and liquid crystal display. It can realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of materials, density control, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The hydraulic press and conveying system adopted in the mine is composed of single-tube and double-tube hydraulic presses and conveyors.
An independent hydraulic pressure integrated station, to avoid the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, to ensure the reliability of the hydraulic system.
Check the soil, install the module, fill the mold, close the door, and automatic transportation of the pallet, complete the whole process independently by the hydraulic system, thus achieving the reduction of mechanical wear and tear.
The equipment should be checked regularly to ensure the stability of the performance. The imported computer, electronic components, sealing materials and hydraulic components should be used to ensure the performance of the equipment.
The wall and floor of the machine are made of a single steel plate, and the cutting line is welded without any joints. The filling box is free to swing and guide direction, effectively reducing the mechanical wear.
Utilizing a mold, reducing the load, filling the mold with a single material and a two-way synchronization of the vibrations, achieving an integrated, synchronous operation, and ensuring a stable vibration effect.
The vibrating motor is composed of a wall body, a module, a mechanical exciter and an electronic control system. The vibrating frequency is adjusted according to the material's price-performance ratio, which reduces wear and tear and extends service life. This reduces costs.
This machine has a dual-functionality of manual and automatic control. It can be operated manually or automatically through the control module.

The modern apprenticeship system of the school is to be implemented in Chengdu. Upon enrollment, students will become employees of the school.
Yesterday, the reporter from the city education committee was surprised to learn that this year, our city will be piloting the "modern apprenticeship" model of human resource development in 60 urban and rural schools. At the same time, the students accepted into the pilot program will be granted apprenticeship status and will be recruited by the trial enterprises afterwards.
The Education Bureau requires that all private schools recruit and admit students in accordance with the regulations on private education, clearly identify the student's status as either a full-time student or an apprentice, and sign a tripartite agreement with the school, parents and employer. For students under 16 years old, a four-party agreement is also required to ensure their safety.

Doctors from South Africa: The power of social media and traditional media is strong, but it is more effective for light diseases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new variant of the Coronavirus is more contagious and spreads faster than SARS.
According to the Associated Press, the spread of AIDS in South Africa has been reported by a group of 5,000 doctors from the province of Kwazulu-Natal. They said that the symptoms of the new cases of AIDS are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever similar to flu symptoms.
The organization's overall coordinator Unben Pillay (M.D.) said that he has to see about 30 patients per day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
They can control the disease at home and most people will recover within 10 to 14 days.
He said, this package includes elderly patients and those with health problems, such people are more likely to be infected with the coronavirus easily.
He said that compared to the previous wave of the disease, the new cases he treated had difficulty breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
During the two weeks after the first case of pneumococcal meningitis was reported in the southern part of Africa, other health workers also shared similar experiences.
Although we have collected enough data, it still needs several weeks of time. However, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the severe cases of the new coronavirus were found among the hospitalized patients, which is half of the proportion of the first wave of the epidemic. The average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the recent cases in South Africa, only 3% died, while in the early cases of the virus in South Africa, the mortality rate was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the head of the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, cited data and other reports to say, ‚ÄúCurrently, almost all the evidence suggests that this is a mild illness.‚Äù
He still said: "We need to obtain the data in the later period."
Under normal circumstances, the time for hospitalization and death is delayed, while we have entered this wave of the epidemic only two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospital rates, as well as testing current vaccines and treatments.
Despite the fact that the novel coronavirus has become the world's most important infectious disease, there have been cases of outbreaks in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the pandemic.
According to the health department, the number of new cases of illness in Guangdong Province in December increased by 400%. Tests showed that the majority of the cases were infected with the novel virus.

Education assessment: What can we do to save the children in danger?
If the famous public service advertisement of "No buying, no selling, just killing" is compared to the popular "No harm, no foul" mentality, then in a good environment without coercion, the prevention of crime will be more effective, the risk of harm will be minimized, the cost will be high, and the crime will not occur.
Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department announced the launch of a platform for urgent dissemination of information about lost children.
This is the authoritative platform for publishing information about lost children, and quickly finding the lost children with the help of the Internet.
After hearing the name of this App, "Group Circle", I felt warm and cozy.
The new technology means not only the name "Wen-yi" (literally "culture and art") but also the feeling of love and joy, and the application of information is very practical and effective.
To apprehend the perpetrator and to recover the abducted child is the primary goal, to ensure the safety of the child and their family's freedom.
Only then was it the trial and punishment of the suspected person.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many "big words".
Before breaking the case, we should pay attention to the physical safety of the victim first.
Different topics are discussed under the urgent and difficult situation of ‚Äúrescue‚Äù. For example, whether selling children should be punished by death penalty or not. It is difficult to make a conclusion due to the complexity of the issue. However, it is unavoidable to help the children in need.
According to the experience of handling such cases, people tend to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the loot.
Searching for a missing child can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The further the child is from home, the more difficult it is to find them, and the case becomes more complex.
Under such circumstances, extracting information from platforms like "Questions and Answers" can be directly helpful in uncovering cases and finding missing children, which is an effective action.
After all, "putting down the bandits" was a task that required the entire legal system to be put in place.
To protect the interests of victims of crime, to safeguard children and families, from perfecting the law to ensuring the security of the law, and from the secrecy of the law to the compassion of the law, we must persist in our concern for the weak.
In addition to preventing the sale of children, it can be done better in the family and society.
For example, a common case, a family of three took a nap at the train station, only to wake up and find their child missing.
As a parent of a two-year-old, you cannot expect them to have enough self-protection skills. However, as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some basic protective consciousness.
The parents and the child took a rest and were protected by the stable environment. It was the most effective preventive measure against child abduction.
From the perspective of the police, cracking down on illegal activities is an important task. However, it is also important to pay attention to the other side of the story, which involves buying and selling children.
Unlawful behavior of an individual is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the law of my country, the punishment for selling children is 5 years imprisonment; in cases of special severity, the death penalty may be applied, and all the criminal's assets will be confiscated.
At the height of the crackdown on crime, the sale of children has become more and more difficult. It is evident that this type of crime is particularly serious and deserves heavier punishment.
There are still many shoplifting cases happening every year.
People's understanding of child rearing and education in the family is weakening, and the legal awareness is becoming shallow.
Educational policies should be synchronized and advanced with the development of the people in this part.
To effectively control illegal sales, it is impossible to rely solely on strict enforcement of laws and regulations by the government.
If there is a wide presence of the market, the sellers will always seek for more profits, and they will keep innovating their selling methods. This will lead to a confrontation between the sellers and the law enforcers, which may result in a low efficiency.
Therefore, by understanding the concept of law, it can help to prevent and control illegal activities such as gambling and buying and selling children.
Comrade Yang Hongdong spoke at the Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress Spiritual Meeting of the 19th National Congress of the CPC.
Drawing power from the Party's century-long struggle history.
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th, the vice-chairman of the provincial committee, the vice-chairman of the propaganda department and the director of the publicity department of the province, Yang Huan, went to the Mao'an Mountain Video Creation Garden to interactively spread the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and learn the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping. They also learned the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Yang Hongdong spoke from three aspects: his own experience, his feelings, and his understanding of the Party's theory and spirit. He deeply explored and broadly expounded the core meaning and requirements of the whole meeting.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congress and the spirit of the whole party, so as to strengthen the sense of unity, promote the spirit of learning, and increase the strength of defending the "two unities" and the "two consolidations". We should have a clear political consciousness, clear action consciousness and unwavering determination to move forward in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive dialogue, the representatives of the grassroots, enterprises and young people discussed the relationship between the three historic decisions, the meaning of the "two establish" decision, how to grasp the direction of the enterprise, and how the young people of the new era can draw power from the century-long party history. Yang He, using a common language and vivid examples, answered the questions from the young party members, and firmly believed that from the party's century-long struggles, they should draw the power of advancing and tightly unite with the central leadership.
According to the preliminary estimates, the number of graduating students in the Beijing region in 2022 is expected to reach 26.8 million.

Reporters from the scene witnessed that the number of graduating seniors in Beijing this year is estimated to reach 26.8 million, an increase of 1.6 million people compared to last year.
The person in charge of human resources and social security of Beijing Municipality expressed that they will strengthen the matching of supply and demand, support the implementation of proactive employment policies, expand the job channels, provide assistance to unemployed people, and support innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as improve service efficiency in these aspects.
The Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will build an experimental platform to increase job supply, actively contact 40 universities and colleges to provide internship opportunities, visit enterprises and institutions to understand the needs of employment, and integrate the information of job demand and vacancies. It will focus on "six-pack" employment, that is, to enlarge the scope of businesses and recruitment, to recruit employees from state-owned enterprises, to recruit talents from the grassroots level, to provide internship opportunities for unemployed people, and to provide entrepreneurial support for job seekers. It will also implement a dynamic management system to recommend at least five job vacancies for each graduate, ensuring that 100% of the graduates have employment intentions.
In reality, I don't know whether it was the store's fault or my own mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Investigation failed.
I hope you will understand this.
Because the delivery time was much faster than the display, it was 30 minutes.
No need, thank you.
It has changed hands already.
He had waited for a long time.
That restaurant has always been talking about processing.
It has been waiting for several hours.
The International Olive Council will divide olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.

According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin Oil (Top Grade): It is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is pure natural product.
The fragrance of the plant is exquisite, with a gentle sweetness and a mildly sour taste, not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil (FVO): The acidity is slightly higher than 2%, but still within the normal range. It has a pure and delicate taste, with a lightly fruity aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Oil (ÊôÆÈÄöÂàùÊ¶®Ê©ÑÊ¶ÑÊ≤π): Taste and aroma can be maintained, acidity should not exceed 3.3%.
The crude oil that has been refined to reach an acid number of over 3.3% is called "secondary oil".
The oil can be divided into two levels: refined and unrefined.
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, to achieve a balance of flavor, aroma and color, with an acidity of no more than 1.5%, resulting in a transparent light golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: This is a refined oil obtained by extracting and refining olive pomace oil through a chemical process.
You should have already discovered that the acidity of the mustard oil is an important indicator of its quality.

The mainland of China (including the sea) is the main production area.
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, France, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somaliland, etc.

The Democratic National Convention has ended, and the new president has been elected. The fire of freedom will never die out.
The Online Summit for Democracy, attended by over 110 countries' government and civil society leaders and private sector representatives, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
During the closing speech at the conference, Liu Yandong said that freedom's flame burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and no authoritarian regime can extinguish it forever.
He also expressed his plan to convene the second Global People's Congress in 2020.
The Taiwanese government representative, political advisor Tang Fong and other activists from the Hong Kong democracy movement, such as Joshua Wong, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Bowen said: "We know that our work is so difficult and overwhelming."
Although we knew it, we could still accept the challenge, for as I had said before, what happened at the summit was a demonstration of the fact that the democratic world was nowhere to be found.
The flame of freedom, which is unquenchable even by totalitarian regimes, is burning in the hearts of people all over the world and throughout history.
We must continue to demonstrate and safeguard our democracy with the concerted effort of the entire society.
He said: "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democracy, promote reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be able to resist the temptation of power for our own benefit and prioritize the public interest."
The second day of the National People's Congress focused on defending human rights, preserving democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital totalitarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is the "International Human Rights Day".
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ant√≥nio Guterres, also expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democracy movement is facing a great challenge globally, especially with the emergence of new digital technologies.
He said, "This is the time to uphold the shared values and standpoints as well as the democratic spirit."
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality issues, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding women's and girls' opportunities.
This also requires resolute denunciation of all forms of nationalism, racism, and extremism, including the use of all available technologies to promote revolution.
A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, addressed the UN Human Rights Council by pre-recording a video message, reminding and encouraging the Council to continue paying attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other minority groups in China.
He said: ‚ÄúFor a long time, the world has always been subject to the Chinese rising, yet it has never established a mechanism to hold it accountable.‚Äù
This is why political figures and social leaders must work together.
We must utilize all the resources we possess to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task.
Luo Guanzhong also urged the world to unite and resist the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some people in the middle fear the leader, perhaps some people in the middle do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some people in the middle do not understand the (Communist) Party's threat to our democratic values."
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Fighting Against Digital Isolation and Defending Democratic Values" held by the Taiwanese Government, a video was released titled "The Statement of the Nation". The video emphasized Taiwan's stance on opposing authoritarianism and defending civil rights.
He also shared his experience of how to build trust through transparent information sharing and combat the novel coronavirus crisis.
He said, ‚ÄúAt the frontline of the struggle against authoritarianism in Taiwan, we have remained steadfast and will continue to advance the cause of global freedom, democracy and human rights.‚Äù
During the pandemic period, various authoritarian governments around the world have been rationalizing their violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests. This has resulted in a retreat of global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down the flag to fight fake news.
While the second day of the National People's Congress was going on, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for severe violations of human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that had allegedly used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

I know that.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time was always delayed.
Originally, it was supposed to be #NUMBER#.
I didn't call him.
He didn't eat.
I will definitely file a lawsuit.
You didn't send it yet, why are you still talking about it?

Hi, the live chicken that was just delivered to the restaurant is very delicious.
I want to try out playing basketball, but I'm afraid of myself getting too frustrated and not wanting to continue. So I'm looking for a place with a reasonable price to practice my skills.
Unfriendly, in reality, the price tends to be inversely proportional to the friendly degree, if you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap garbage, such "entrance fee" is really industrial waste.
Their strength was very low, the ball was hit to the top of the net, the vibration was very great, the hard ball could not be stopped, and it was difficult for the skilled players to control it.
The logic and subtlety of net passes are as difficult as the Chinese language, yet you still refuse to learn, buy expensive stuff and make things difficult for yourself. You keep playing and replaying, so you won't have to pay again. This way, you can enjoy the game without spending too much money.
I can tell the difference between good and bad now. That means I have made progress. I will come back here to buy expensive things later and make two times money.
Advising to buy a second-hand Prince or Dong Fangzhuo's ball is enough, since these two brands are not popular and the price is not too high, so it's better to buy a new one at 500-600 yuan. Enjoying the feeling of the ball is not worth the money?
Treat newbies kindly, but once they've passed the newbie stage, they'll be treated like adults. However, most people, especially girls, won't be able to pass the newbie stage.
The delivery time has been extended multiple times due to the order delay.
Can I help you with anything else?
Delay
Thank you.
Is that so? I already have credit, right?
Do I need to re-order the same thing again? It's not necessary to calculate it again, right?
You are welcome, you have ordered food from this restaurant, but it was missing many ingredients and the chicken was also raw.

The item under my bed requires delivery, and there is no self-collection option available.

You still have to wait for a long time before the food is delivered.
The family has already received the worker.
Your phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, name is #NAME#.
You owe me a reasonable exchange.
You can, but your horsehandling is very troublesome, so it's a hassle to deal with.
Can you check if it's still on the road? If you can, send it there immediately.
If there is nothing, then return the money for the meal.
In actuality, there is much to consider when it comes to dressing a petite girl.
The girl wearing the skirt cannot be too short or too long, the difference should not be too much at the knee, and it can cover the bulky thighs at the same time.
If the skirt is too short, it will cause the fat on the legs to be exposed.
When you are too tall, you will feel embarrassed and bulky.
If you wear different colors of clothes from top, bottom and legs, it will make you look taller. When you wear a colorful top, it will make your legs look longer and your bottom look slimmer.
In reality, many petite girls are wearing deep colors such as black, navy, and burgundy as their uniforms, which the author has deep understanding of. Deep colors are also a good way to hide their body shapes, while the high-end and elegant black skirt is their first choice.
Wearing a black short skirt will make people think you are slimmer.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear your pants and shoes too tightly, or people will notice it.
As cultural diversity increases, the colors should not be too bright and flashy.
When people pay attention to your leg and foot, they will get a feeling of being fat.
For the slightly plump girl, it's important to teach her about the right clothes and accessories to wear.
Don't wear too tight or too short shorts, it will make you look uncomfortable. If your legs are too thick, you can wear a long skirt or a net skirt (with a grid pattern). Choose a soft and comfortable fabric for the skirt, and pair it with a loose-fitting blouse. This will help to hide the girl's imperfections.
Of course, the little girl was also curious about why she was wearing a short skirt.
The fat girl should choose a matching color for the short skirt, so that the fat girl's bulky figure will be highlighted with an increase of height.
Wearing shorts and high heels can make your legs look longer and slimmer, which is the hottest combination for the summer!
If you are upper-body fat but have slim legs, we recommend you choose a beautiful feeling sleeveless dress.
Not only can it block out large pores, but it can also show off your advantages.
A-shirt will make you look slim, especially for plump girls. When you wear it, choose a tight-fitting one to form a layered effect and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt and shorts can be a great option for those who are plus-sized.
The girl who was petite was also able to exude a fashionable feeling.
As long as they can grasp the rules of wearing clothes and accessories, even the most petite girls will become the focus of attention.
After changing your clothes and putting on makeup, you should also exercise more in life and strive to get up early to break away from the label of "micro-shrinking" women. Let's have fun!

Girls donating money to their elder sisters' charity fundraiser: "If you get hurt, it's still okay."
A young girl was standing in front of a wooden board at the Hunan Forest Park. The board had the words "human flesh and blood" and "one arrow" carved on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl in Hangzhou donating money to charity with the caption ‚ÄúGiving is Fun‚Äù went viral on WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a wooden plank which is slightly taller than her, with the words ‚Äúhuman flesh‚Äù and ‚Äúten yuan‚Äù written on it. It is meant to symbolize that after paying a fee, one can use a bow and arrow to shoot at the target.
This behavior triggered a heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City, Xiangshan Sub-Bureau, spread the news that the person in charge of the incident had verified it to the reporter of the New China News Agency. The police confirmed that the girl had done such an impulsive and excessive act, but this behavior is not worthy of praise. After warnings and advice, the girl had already left the local police station.
The little girl on the street corner was collecting donations for the charity. She held a donation box in one hand and a signboard with the words ‚ÄúDonate Now‚Äù in the other.
While browsing the Internet, a long-haired girl with a distinctive style stood in front of a wooden plank, writing "human flesh and blood, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" in black ink on it. On the other wooden plank in front of her, she had written her bank account and WeChat/Alipay numbers.
This picture caused a controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think that this behavior is similar to "beggars begging for food", and there are also many netizens who express their sympathy.
We arrived at the square at around 10:30am when we noticed the situation. By then, there were few people left.
The police station near the scene of the incident accepted the media interview of the local people, and the two girls, aged 20, were dressed up in a youthful and beautiful manner.
A girl was crying in the middle of the road, begging the people around to play the game with her. Another girl was standing beside her, helping her drink and talking about her sick sister, who needs an urgent surgery fee. Please help them.
We have contacted the police in Guizhou and found out that the girl is raising money for her sister, who has leukemia.
Last night, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City Xiaoshan Branch informed the Xinhua News Agency reporter that the girl's name is Jiaqi Li, and she is 11 years old. She had donated money to help her sister, who is also named Jiaqi Li.
Although the treatment still requires a lot of money, people were too busy to think of a good way to donate or contribute. Therefore, they resorted to such behavior.
He said, throughout the entire process, two girls acted as lookouts, one responsible for handling the gun and the other taking pictures, but neither of them were involved in the actual shooting and no one discovered them until after the fact when the pictures were uploaded to Weibo.
After the regulations were issued, the department was put under control, and the bow and arrow used by the guards did not belong to the management scope.
The person in charge expressed that "We do not encourage taking this kind of donation approach."
After the warning and threats from the police, she had already left the police station.
The heat dissipation effect is good, the thinness degree is convenient, the exterior material is satisfactory, and the price-performance ratio is very high.
The new machine is very good.
Stability of performance, four winds blowing cool air, no heat problem, worth recommending.

What will be the hottest year in 2021?
The Beijing Olympics was undoubtedly the biggest event of the year.
Do you think only the Olympic athletes in good health can win the awards?
The article "Quick Look! An Olympic Project Manager Can Crush Any Giant Brand" in the front section of the newspaper was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can always be the first to act and no one can match them in their daily routine of shifting bricks, taking risks, and working overnight. They also have the skills to save fires, bake pizzas, and face any challenges.
This article is like a funny joke, but it also reflects the daily struggles of project managers and their bitterness towards current project management work.
Employees who are involved in project management work gradually choose to release themselves from the difficult situation in the work by taking some actions.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certified professionals increases every year, more and more project management practitioners are able to enhance their project management skills through learning.
According to the 'China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)' published by the Project Management Institute, the total number of people who have taken the PMP¬Æ exam in China has reached nearly 60 million, with a pass rate of around 42 million people, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP¬Æ certification holders.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing steadily, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on simple and straightforward approaches can no longer bring success. The ever-changing work environment makes us realize that we need to learn and explore new paths.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can one guarantee project management work will be smooth and hassle-free?
Many project management beginners expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they can systematically grasp the ten major domains and five process groups of project management knowledge, but when it comes to actual project management work, it is still a bit of a fog.
Many project managers frequently feedback the following problems: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, absence of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and workflow support, work becomes unstable, unpredictable, and lack of control; unclear division of labor, team members are not clear about their roles, and "old oil barrel" phenomenon is difficult to address; lack of cross-departmental collaboration, poor communication, and slow progress.

Advertisers should lead the rational consumption of consumers before and after the Spring Festival - Economic Observation Network Ôºç Professional Economic News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" online payment business transaction volume reached 1.77 billion yuan, far exceeding the previous year's record.
The Chinese government has been giving out large amounts of red envelopes to stimulate consumption, leading to a surge in consumer spending. This has caused a lot of excitement among the people, but it has also made us reflect on the implications of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer culture.
Before coming to "Double Twelve" shopping spree, "Zhe Xin" (short for "Zhe Xin" Financial Limited Company) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the public, especially young people, to build good consumption habits and resist blind consumption.
According to the 2020 Consumer Financial Wellness Report released by the People's Bank of China, the national consumer financial wellness index was 66.81, higher by 2.04 than in 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese citizens in terms of financial consumption is better, but there is still a large difference in terms of financial behavior and skills. We need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Older people and younger people have a low financial literacy level, which is a major challenge for financial education. The report published by Norilsk Research and Central Television's Economy Report showed that young people have a huge consumption potential, and credit and debit products have become an important way for young people to upgrade their consumption. Nearly 87% of young people have no debt, but some of them have excessive consumption and risk-taking behavior, which has attracted the attention of the outside world. However, some young people have excessive consumption, following the trend and behaving recklessly, which has led to the accumulation of too much financial pressure and risk, and even caused social problems to gradually increase. Financial institutions should be brave and take up the social responsibility. They should provide correct guidance in a positive direction.
As a long-term, sustainable consumer financial institution, we always strive to provide quality and caring services to help people build their own happy life. We advocate for consumers to establish proper and correct consumption habits, and actively respond to regulatory calls to improve the rational consumption consciousness of young people in particular.
Over the past few years, we have been dedicated to promoting financial literacy among young people in China through various activities such as organizing the Financial Inclusion Challenge, partnering with top-tier universities to launch innovation and practice competitions, and providing rational guidance to help young people form a rational consumption mentality and plan their consumption demands in a rational way. This has helped them accumulate wealth and build a better life.
Twelve is coming, reminding all consumers to build a rational consumption mind and spend the money correctly. We should resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoiding over-indebtedness and damaging personal credit.
Consumption should always be planned in advance, and force yourself to pay on time and repay the debts.
If you miss the deadline, the missed deadline record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may cause adverse effects on your future car buying and house buying activities.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also select legitimate institutions and channels, and check whether related institutions have the required business license.
In the future, we will build a reliable and trustworthy consumption financial system and update it continuously, providing tailored services to meet the diversified needs of consumers and helping them to improve their financial knowledge and sense of moderation in borrowing. We will also help them to cultivate a rational attitude towards consumption and develop a long-term partnership with them.

The People's Daily Online - The South China Sea Cooperation Committee Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover station of the King of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, includes the countries of Aman, Al-Arab League (Arabia), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that, this was the first time in 2017 that the President of Mongolia, Kh.Battulga, visited Kuwait. The visit was significant as it was the first high-level visit from Mongolia to Kuwait since the imposition of the ban on Iranian vessels in the Arabian Gulf in 2017, which had led to a worsening of the maritime security situation in the region.
In this critical moment, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain and Egypt have broken off their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive ban on its transportation, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations and having a close relationship with Iran.
The strained relations between China and its neighbors have had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the overland, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only solved at the 2021 January meeting of the China-Pakistan Maritime Cooperation Committee in Beijing, when the respective countries signed an agreement to ease tensions and move towards ‚Äúcooperation and stability‚Äù.
Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan reopened their border.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are currently working to restore their relationship with Kuwait after appointing new ambassadors.
The Chinese government is committed to resolving the disputes in the South China Sea with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in order to restore and maintain the relationship between China and ASEAN for the sake of mutual benefits and regional stability.
During the visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to the UAE, both sides agreed to open two coastal roads connecting the two countries.
The 725-km-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of the two countries' citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia-China Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in the Chinese city of Aman, and the two countries' businesses have signed a memorandum of understanding worth $300 billion.
The Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement between Iran, the United States, and five other world powers to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. However, some Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, opposed the deal, claiming that it was not effective in resolving the Iranian missile issue. Thus, they initiated a series of talks to renegotiate the deal.
Each coastal country has always seen Iran as a long-term rival and perceived Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country in the region considered the issue of Iran's missile activities as a problem that could not be resolved, and failed to take any action to contain Iran's activities in the region. This was a dangerous weakness.
In the wake of the failure of the talks between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program, Saudi Arabia and Iran have begun direct negotiations.
The goal is to tame the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the growth of national economy in the Pearl River Delta.
The first meeting of the Conference on the Law of the Sea will be held in Cancun, Mexico, from November 29th to December 3rd, 2010. This meeting will be the first time that the Conference on the Law of the Sea has been held since the end of the disputes between some of the member states and Costa Rica.
This is an opportunity to promote the recovery of the Gulf Cooperation Council and to make a contribution to its unity, through various measures, in order to effectively address common challenges and to ensure the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

The sound of people running in the New Mountains District is the loudest!
This car we brought for you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the car is near two hundred million yuan, and the road tax for one year is about ten thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Because you have the power of 700 horses, can you imagine how fast it can be?
The editor didn't know either, the data shows that it needs only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably the same as myvi's 30km/h speed.
The low-slung car seats, the tinted windows and the giant intakes at the corners of the car, as well as the glass-covered engine bay, perfectly capture the essence of the Lamborghini Aventador.
For the explanation of car models, you don't need to say too much, just Google it and the editor has prepared some explanations of the Google results!
Everyone is watching the same thing, but it's so interesting that no one wants to look away! (It's kind of cool!)
It costs about RM1 for 1km of petrol. (The car owner doesn't really care about it.)
The posture and maneuverability of the car should be practiced regularly to avoid stiffness and awkwardness (due to being stuck halfway out of the car's cabin).
The sound of the engine was too loud, so I had to turn down the volume of my ears after getting off the car. (But it was still very comfortable.)
The car was too big to park in the ordinary parking lot, and it was very narrow. I was afraid of being hit by the car when the gate opened.
It's a bit lonely because there's no one on the road. (This is what I said, unrelated to the driver, haha)
Don't make a mistake, this video's super fast running has nothing to do with selling. We apologize!

The car accident was worth millions of dollars!

Allowing University Spirit and Spirit of the Times to Resonate in Unison - New China Net
The spirit of a university is to form a series of educational concepts and values pursuit over a long period of time during the development process, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been an important factor in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, and has made important contributions to the progress of a nation.
From the first modern university in the world, the University was born with a unique mission and spirit, different from other social organizations. For the University, it was born in the difficult time of the nation, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the values of ‚Äúrighteousness, harmony and peace‚Äù and ‚Äústrengthening the nation‚Äù.
The trend of information and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global education competition, technology competition and human resource competition are constantly heating up. Higher education has become an important "supply side" in the face of these challenges, and the structural reform opportunities and challenges are unprecedented.
The proposal of "Integrated Development of World-Class University and World-Class Academic Disciplines" was particularly highlighted in the report, which showed the Chinese people's confidence and determination to make progress in higher education and to build world-class universities and disciplines. It also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we rapidly build a world-class university and world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap between us and the world's top universities and disciplines? How can we achieve the "Fast Track" of "Supercar" in the shortest possible time?
In addition to having faith in the target, path, and ability, a college should also fully exploit the three advantages: first, by continuously introducing outstanding scholars from abroad, it can learn advanced experiences from world-renowned universities; second, by inheriting the profound wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, it can promote the development of its excellent traditional culture; third, by taking advantage of the superior system of socialist countries, it can strengthen the motivation of the target, unite the strength, and improve the image. Furthermore, it can optimize the resource arrangement and provide a solid foundation for rapid growth.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that building a world-class university requires the presence of multiple campuses, each of which should highlight its own advantages and characteristics.
In order to have a distinct Chinese feature, it is also necessary to manifest individual uniqueness in terms of goal orientation, study tradition and resource endowment.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we should pay attention to three aspects of its features: first, it emphasizes the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, and builds an integrated education and business environment to form a complete value chain of entrepreneurial education; second, it actively adjusts the optimization of the academic system, creating a favorable institutional environment for the cross-border gathering of disciplines, and actively cultivating interdisciplinary and signature cross-border achievements; third, it emphasizes the construction of an all-round service system and social service system, and actively promotes in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, accelerating the formation of a comprehensive and collaborative production and research system.
During this process, it is especially important to remain steadfast in the university spirit, so that the university spirit can harmonize with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the core values of "seeking innovation", "hard work", "moral integrity", and "practical wisdom" form a new system of understanding and expression. The spirit of "opening up, awakening, and cultivating the people" and "building a strong and prosperous nation" is the latest description of the university's spirit.
This is a school that has been persisting in the correct direction of study, accumulating culture and spiritual intensity, and protecting it with great importance. It is abundant and profound in meaning.
The first emphasis is to open up and embrace a spirit of inclusiveness, manifesting in the pride of being a "world-class university" for nurturing talents. The second emphasis is to pursue excellence and integrity, exemplified by the perseverance of Tao Xingzhi and Liu Heng in their pursuit of truth and moral integrity. The third emphasis is to innovate and reform, encompassing both knowledge-seeking and technological innovation, as well as a commitment to national revitalization.
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit, is the soul of Zhejiang University 120 years of education.
A wise man hears the sound of silence, while a brilliant man sees the unseen.
China's higher education should seize the opportunity to further consolidate its position in the global market, and deepen its understanding of the historical mission and burden of the higher education industry. This will accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should guard the humanistic spirit of independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times interact with each other, and thus provide inexhaustible energy for the realization of national strength and ethnic revival, and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

I saw some news about the stock price of my friend's company, and the greatest feeling I had was the selection of the industry they chose to invest in - the stock market. Firstly, they should choose a large growing industry, with a market size of at least 1000 billion yuan or more. Secondly, they should select a promising industry with good growth potential in the future, considering the industry's growth potential in the next 3-5 years. Finally, they should choose an industry with stable policies.
The size of the market and the stage of industry development are the two factors that determine the width and length of the competitive landscape. A flat or mountain-like competitive landscape depends on the market and industry's competitive situation.

The new year brings the first item of business: summarizing 2021 and adjusting 2022 military strategies.
The essence of martial arts is to "do the things right" and to "do the things correctly".
Therefore, strategy is based on "do the right thing", which is equivalent to doing the correct thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land on the ground, in most of the tactical thinking, there is still space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase customer number (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider whether to deepen current domain or extend to new domain (Strategic Thinking). For example, how to increase customer retention rate (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider how to improve core customer and high value customer retention rate (Strategic Thinking). In increasing activity participation rate (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider how to set correct activity KPI, achieve correct activity target, such as increasing target customer participation rate, activating inactive high value customer, calibrating new customer. For example, how to increase DAU (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.

A group of ethnic minority students from Yunnan Province filed a lawsuit against the East China Normal University for discrimination.
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice Department, protesting the discriminatory admissions processes of three universities - University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University - in their recruitment of students.
The Asian-American Education Alliance held a news conference in Washington D.C. on the same day to initiate a complaint against the Trump administration.
The Asian American student population at three top-tier universities in the United States has grown exponentially over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian Americans at these universities has remained largely the same.
Research has shown that these universities in the so-called "holistic admissions" process of recruitment, "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants.
According to the research done by Zhao Yukun and others in 2014, the rate of admission of Asian applicants was the lowest among all racial and ethnic groups in these three universities.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all the schools in the Chinese American Student Recruitment Consortium, Berkeley and Dartmouth have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while UCLA and Brown have implemented race-based affirmative action for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told the reporters from the Chinese Embassy that they hoped the US Department of Education and Justice would launch an investigation and take appropriate measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asians after the fact was confirmed.
They also hoped that the school would take the initiative to address this issue and change its recruitment policy towards Asians.
Currently, the three schools being sued have yet to respond.
The Asian-American Education League was established in 2015, when it had filed a lawsuit against Harvard University for racial discrimination in its admission process. However, the U.S. Department of Education had rejected the league's complaint for procedural reasons.
This includes participants from outside the United States Chinese American Association, as well as participants from the United States Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Filipino American communities.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building in Yuzhong Town, Zhejiang Province from the real estate agent. After multiple visits to the site, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory building.
On the same day, Mr. Liu purchased a house and signed the property ownership rights with his family. After that, they negotiated with the seller and transferred the money through the bank. Finally, they got the house with a down payment of 20 million yuan.
Lin Xingyi signed as the collector of the deposit on the contract of the factory, where it was clearly written, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer within one week after signing the factory purchase and sale contract."
However, after extensive negotiations on the scope of the sale, the payment method and other major contract terms, the buyer and seller were unable to reach a consensus, resulting in a delay in signing the contract.
After considering that both sides failed to reach an agreement on the content, Ling took back 20 million yuan as a deposit from Liu and returned it to him after several days.
It was quite difficult to see the house in the middle of China, but the money had been exchanged, the down payment had been made, and all the paperwork was in order. However, the buyer suddenly refused to sign the contract, which made the seller feel helpless and angry.
For this, Luo Xinsheng brought a lawsuit against the city of Yuzhong in the People's Court.
The court held that both parties failed to sign a formal contract, and thus the case should be settled as a commercial dispute. Therefore, the plaintiff should not be awarded any damages, and the defendant should not be held liable for any breach of contract.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff raised an appeal.
The original verdict of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is maintained.
[Lawyer's Warning] In the trading process, we should be prudent and cautious, paying attention to our duties and obligations.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should be prudent and attentive to the duties, such as verifying the ownership information of the house, whether the house has been occupied by people, and clearly specify the time and place of delivery in the contract, to avoid any disputes between the two sides.
After the conclusion of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Weimin made a statement on Saturday, December 11, saying that the United States had organized the "leadership" meeting of the "Democracy Forum" which was "to institutionalize democracy, to weaponize democracy, to brandish democracy as a tool to split and oppose each other, to transfer internal contradictions to the external front".
The Chinese government regards the United States' long-term efforts to change its political system and value orientation as an attempt to weaken its foundation, promote "color revolutions" and unilateral sanctions, and cause disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has already become a 'large-scale killing weapon' of the United States interfering with other countries.
This time the Summit was to fulfill the pledge of the election campaign.
The meeting was to be held for two days and was to be conducted via video. 111 global leaders were invited, including Taiwan's leadership, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the meeting, China and Russia jointly attacked the United States, accusing the United States of lacking the qualification to host such a meeting.
There are also suspicions of ulterior motives in the international arena, such as criticism of the invitation to the summit and the organization of some authoritarian leaders, such as the President of the Philippines, the President of Poland and the President of Brazil, which have raised doubts about the true intentions of the government. It is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes that the summit was organized.
The German Federal Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen also attended the video conference of the People's Congress.
The statement made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, June 1, 2019, was that "Today's American-style democracy is on full display, with its glaring manifestations of money politics, personal politics, extreme polarization, political chaos, social fracturing, and inter-racial tension." American democracy is a "rich people's game" built on a capitalist foundation.
During his speech, President Obama expressed, "As the leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to fortify our democracy, to advance reform, and to resist the lure of authoritarianism and the forces of intolerance."
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation and in my view, this is our generation's defining challenge."
After bowing, he said, "The challenge of defending global democracy and human rights is a continuous and daunting one, and democracy needs warriors to protect it."
The United States has promised to open up a year of action after the 2020 Democratic National Convention, including a proposal of $4.244 billion in funding to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
Before the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Chinese government made specific public promises to improve its democratic system in order to show its commitment to democracy.
We pledge to work for a better future for all countries, and to report our progress next year.
He was so kind that he only feared that he had sent the wrong address.
Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
Environment: Regulations and Services [Food Ring] Food: Dishes are served quickly „ÄåOld-fashioned mooncake„ÄçMy must-try dishes „ÄåMooncake is too sweet, too soft, too good to eat„ÄçYou must try „ÄåEast-West Sichuan Sauce„ÄçThick and flavorful, a must-taste! „ÄåDongjiang Mala Hot Pot„ÄçThe soup is very fragrant and delicious!
The flavor of the dish is great and the meat is delicious. The service is enthusiastic.
It's been so long since I last came to Xiangshan. The fruits I picked were so delicious to drink and the real materials I used to make the dumplings were so fragrant. The first time I tasted the steamed buns was my favorite Sichuan flavor!
The steamed buns were cooked to the right degree, the quantity was sufficient, the packaging was beautiful, the wings were crispy and the soup was delicious. The process of making the dumplings was also quite satisfactory.
People praise our delicious food and warm service. Our meat is especially good.
The old store in Changsha has been around for many years. It is located in a small alley, made of wood and concrete.
The wait for the dumplings was interminable, and when we finally got them, the dumplings were cold and the sandwiches had split open...
It has been several years since I last visited Chengdu to eat Sichuan cuisine. Various small restaurants serving Sichuanese dishes have since sprung up, dispersing the customer flow.
It was difficult to find a seat in the store, but the quality of the food was not good. It was better to go elsewhere.
The flavor of the meat is great, and it's a good main dish.
They are selling goods outside the shop.
[Mi]Food: This time the vegetables were a bit disappointing.
Three bowls of chicken: The vegetables were slightly too much, but the chicken was slightly too little.
The taste of this dish is a bit off, the sourness of the base flavor is not enough, so it is overpowered by the sweetness, so everyone can adjust the flavor by adding various seasonings and herbs to the vegetables...
What is the significance of the "red card" in Chinese culture?
Everyone's hobbies are different; some people love collecting, some people love eating, but of course there are also people who love drinking, such as William Grant & Sons's Glenfiddich, which is currently the most popular Scottish single malt whisky and has also won international gold medals.
Every single bottle of red wine has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you might have missed the chance to enjoy its delicious aroma.
How do you drink the red card?
The editors have prepared a simple introduction for you.
The powerful Red Pill wolf is drinking a beer.
The fragrance of the incense is a blend of rich and robust aromas of sandalwood, patchouli and traditional Chinese herbs. It has a deep and exotic flavor with a sweet and smoky taste.
The entrance was filled with the sweet smell of alcohol, accompanied by the fragrance of fresh grass and the heavy aroma of tobacco.
This liquor can be directly mixed with ice and used for drinking, or it can be mixed with your favorite drink to make a delicious cocktail.
The popularity of Kweichow Moutai has been increasing rapidly in the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the people, Kweichow Moutai has been combined with various flavors of beer, snow-white wine, or new-style liquor, becoming a kind of fashionable and long-lasting drink.
These sweet-tasting beverages, besides being able to harmonize with sour and bitter flavors, can also bring visual and sensory pleasure when added to drinks, resulting in a refreshing and wine-like change in the flavor of the drink.
The combination of Red Panda, Wild Sichuan Peppercorn, and Ginger (or Sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink Chinese tea.
The aroma of Sichuan peppercorn is slightly bitter and acidic, but when combined with sugar it will neutralize the bitterness and give the liquor a clean and refreshing fragrance. Of course, the sweetness level can be adjusted according to one's personal taste.
The three best ways to drink wine are as follows: the French way, the German way, and the Italian way. Everyone can use these methods as references and try them out. We hope that this introduction from the editor can help you.
Thoughts on Education: How to Make University Exams Easier for "Academic Superstars" and "Cramming Superstars"The Chinese education system has long been divided into two categories: ‚Äúacademic superstars‚Äù and ‚Äúcramming superstars‚Äù. Academic superstars are those who excel in their studies and are able to achieve high scores in their exams. On the other hand, cramming superstars are those who are able to memorize large amounts of information quickly and are able to answer questions accurately in exams.In recent years, the gap between these two types of students has become increasingly evident. This has caused a lot of debate and discussion in the Chinese education community. Some people argue that the current education system is too focused on rote memorization and cramming, and that it does not foster creativity and independent thinking. Others argue that the system is working as intended and that it is the students‚Äô own responsibility to find the best way to study and prepare for exams.In this article, I will discuss the current education system in China and its implications for students. I will also provide some suggestions on how to make university ex
Three students from Lanzhou University sent a letter to the school leadership, expressing their frustration with the difficulty of the university entrance exam and proposing measures to make the exam more challenging and transform the test type to truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
For a long time, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" in China.
At the university campus, students came from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of study, making the learning situation diverse and unique.
For a group with such diversity of characteristics, there will be different feelings, and it is difficult to avoid.
Of course, if the test is too simple and repetitive, the experience will be completely different.
Students who don't use their strengths may be able to achieve good results by focusing on their studies right before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may be able to get better results with half the effort.
When you come here, you will find yourself in a state of "study shock" during the regular period. You won't put in any effort, yet you can easily pass the test, even getting a high score. When it comes to "study hard" period, you will be seen as a diligent student who always does their homework and notes perfectly.
As seen, the issue of students facing difficulty in university entrance exams in China is not limited to Lanzhou University. We believe this is a problem existing in many universities in China.
From this layer of meaning, we should write a congratulatory letter to the three students who passed the exam.
In reality, many people who have passed university have become clear about how to prepare for the exam, seek various methods from teachers to "extract" questions, compete to narrow the exam range, and even seek "precious guidance" during the examination. Furthermore, during the examination, some people even carry small notes and seek the help of teachers after the examination. This is not a rare phenomenon.
As seen from the perspective of an examiner, the assessment of teaching quality is a directional measure, with the evaluation of student compliance and the comprehensive grasp of teachers on both teaching and learning as the basis. Furthermore, the scientific design of examinations is also based on this.
After entering the university, major specialization began to be divided into many specialty courses, with the basic knowledge as the main content.
Doubtfulness is not a suitable attitude towards learning, as it involves grasping the fundamental knowledge points of a particular subject in its entirety. This is an important content to be tested in university exams.
In essence, the knowledge of a college student is based on scientific principles and basic knowledge, which is relatively fixed from the perspective of knowledge.
Just like what the teacher said 20 years ago, ‚ÄúThe basic knowledge of mathematics I learned in university is still my focus now.‚Äù
Although knowledge points are basic and unchanged, it does not represent a test item type or repeated questions.
At many universities, exams are usually composed of a group of questions, and then the questions are collated and put into an exam paper by a subject specialist teacher. The exam paper is then marked by a group of experienced teachers from the same subject, which can help to reduce the problem of exam paper duplication.
However, the test should be designed to meet the requirements of both theory and practice. The topics should be tailored to the overall situation of the students' learning, which is difficult but interesting. It should also take into account the comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, as well as the integrated grasp of the overall level of student learning. Finally, the test should be dynamic and flexible, so that it can highlight the difficult and easy topics, while also being able to explore the basic knowledge and ability testing.
Examinations are the commanding rod of university education, with what kind of examinations students will have corresponding preparation plans, and this will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the advice letter to the students, the Lanzhou University has highly valued it and has already implemented the reform plan in the whole campus.
All teaching units should organize teachers to conduct seminars and end-of-course exams, formulate relevant examination items and related systems, strengthen the examination and supervision of examination items and evaluation procedures, and refine the grading system.
To solve the problem of single-type questions, repeated questions and other issues faced in university examinations, a corresponding system is needed, but the expertise is expensive and should be comprehensive, not only covering the content but also the students' learning situation. Teachers should not only digest the content but also understand the students' learning process, forming a good interaction, making the examination more realistic, and thus allowing "studying" and "students" to get their due.

The couple had their wedding photos taken at the South Street Store. Currently, there is no store division.
Because we didn't have the time arranged in advance, we had to change the time twice and the photographer Linda was very patient with us and arranged the time for us.
I chose a good weekend to take pictures.
The staff of the gold couple's work are praised by all, regardless of whether they are consultants, beauticians or photographers.
That was my first official makeover, wow! I was so scared, but one day I'll definitely look that good, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super gentle when it comes to makeup. They also do it very naturally.
We were lucky to have good weather when we were shooting the scenery in the Yangtze River City. The makeup artist was always mindful of our clothing, headwear and accessories, and would adjust them whenever necessary.
The photographer was also very quiet, and felt very happy when taking pictures for a whole day.
When choosing photos for an album, due to seeing many examples online, I didn't want to delete too many photos, but when we were actually choosing photos, there was no thought of adding more photos. We just chose 24 photos and moved on. I was shocked when I heard that the package included one million photos and I was scared that I had chosen too many.
Today, the photos were finished and Lanlan gave them to me. I looked at them and felt they weren't good enough, so they helped me re-edit them immediately.
I compared the pictures I took before with the pictures of my sisters and I realized that our pictures were much better than before, simple, clear and fresh. That was the style I wanted.
Recommend everyone to go and take a look at the Shrine of the Golden Man in Xuanzhou!
Price of the package: 3999 yuan
Wish you all a happy and prosperous life. May the journey be as smooth as silk!

Although the guarantee is given by Cynthia Amos, all the babies who have applied for a birth certificate have already been recorded in the system, and fake papers will be supplemented after the week.
He appeared at the news release meeting and explained the issue of making counterfeit newspapers for 10 months.
He said the problem appeared two months ago and he had to face the same issue.
One of the reasons was that Chinese factories producing counterfeit paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed shipments to our country.
He explained, Sabao used paper for counterfeiting and other regions were different, so it couldn't borrow other states' storage.
Quentin Amis revealed the latest batch of fake papers on June 6th, and the printing process was completed on June 8th and handed over to the printing company for partial printing work.

We celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party with pride, officially declaring the completion of the socialist new-democratic society, and striving to achieve the first centenary goal of the great struggle. We also embark on a new journey of modernizing the nation and conquering the second centenary goal.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, summarizing the Party's great achievements and historical experience over the past century, and finally approving the historic decision of the Party - the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Achievements and Experiences of the Party in the Century". This is a political declaration of the new era of the Chinese Communist Party, a commitment to persistently adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and an action plan for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In one year, the world has experienced a great change in terms of global pandemic and new coronavirus pneumonia. The external environment has become more complex and severe. Domestically, the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia and economic and social development have become extremely arduous.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been adhering to the core values of Xi Jinping, persisting in the overall stability of the two major issues of the country and the world, and striving for steady progress in the overall situation of the nation. It has been tenaciously fighting against the changing situation of the past century and the epidemic, and has been actively adjusting and optimizing the economic and social development. It has been striving to build a new development framework, strengthening macroeconomic policies across generations, and actively promoting innovation, deepening reform, and achieving remarkable achievements in the reform and opening up. The party and the country have achieved remarkable successes in various undertakings.
Achieving a good start, a key aspect of it was realized, constructing a new developmental framework and making progress in it, resulting in a new level of efficiency in development.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control has maintained the leading position in the world, with strong, robust and dynamic characteristics continuously displayed; the country's strategic technology strength has been accelerated, major breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of innovation, and the technology innovation capacity has been constantly improved; the industrial chain has been strengthened, exports have been enriched, and structural optimization has been continuously optimized, representing a new growth momentum; the reform and opening up has been deepened, and obstacles to the supply-side structural adjustment and the flow of resources have been broken, creating a new competitive advantage; social security has been strengthened, employment has been expanding, and income growth has been synchronized with economic growth, achieving "double first-class" results; environmental protection has been effectively implemented, and the employment rate has been steadily increasing, with the annual grain harvest continuously staying above 1.3 billion tons, achieving "double first-class" results. China's ecological civilization construction has been continuously promoted, carbon emissions have been reduced, and the low-carbon transformation has been steadily advanced
The achievements of these scores are the result of the core of the Party Central Committee led by General Secretary Xi Jinping, the result of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism and the scientific guidance of the Party Central Committee. It is the unity of the whole Party and the whole country, the hard work and dedication of the people of all ethnic groups.
Practice has proved again that the CPC is the core and the central pillar of the Party and the whole nation. It has established Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism as the guiding ideology of the Party and the nation, and has given a decisive meaning to the development of the Party and the nation. It has also made an important contribution to the great cause of the Chinese nation's glorious history.
With Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the Party has achieved great successes in uniting and leading the Party, the country and the people of all ethnic groups. With Comrade Xi Jinping's new century of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party has provided scientific guidance for the people of all ethnic groups to unite and strengthen their resolve, and we have overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles. On the path of comprehensively building a modern socialist country, we will create a brilliant new era and write an unprecedented glorious chapter in the history of the Party and the Chinese nation.
The 20th National Congress of the CPC will be held next year, which is a major event in the life of the Party and the country.
Spreading the great spirit of the party, persevering in the steady and rigorous course of reform and opening up, comprehensively and meticulously implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress, hastening the construction of a new and modernized socialist country, and driving the momentum of innovation and development, we will continue to make progress in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We will persist in the overall and comprehensive approach of deepening reform, strengthening Party discipline, and improving the quality of development. We will remain firm in our commitment to the people's livelihood, social stability, and economic development, and we will resolutely resist all risks and challenges. We will continue to implement the "six steady" and "six secure" work, and strive to achieve a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We will also continue to pursue the goal of "two centenaries" and "one blue sky" by maintaining a healthy economic environment, a stable social environment, and a clean and beautiful political environment. We will certainly achieve the great victory of the 20th National Congress of the CPC.
Let us tightly unite around the core of Xi Jinping Thought and strengthen the four consciousnesses, four self-confidences, and two defenses. We should constantly enhance our political judgement, political expertise, and political execution, so as to turn the Party Central Committee‚Äôs decisions into real actions and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Education News: Beijing Compressed 2016 Primary and Secondary School Entrance Ratio - China News
The two-day entrance examination for primary and secondary schools in Beijing will be unified organized by the Education Committees of each district.
This year, the average compression rate of Beijing's various districts was higher than ever, and the fierce competition for talents was even more intense.
In the example of Dongcheng District, the proportion of primary and middle school students entering the school in this year does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan, and the number of people entering the school is 380, which does not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Any student who has a talent in sports, arts, and technology, and who is able to register online for the special examination, is qualified to attend the school.
To facilitate student participation in the exam, the East District extended the exam arrangement of last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school area, totaling 13 examination sites.
The examination will be divided into different examination areas according to the examination region and will be conducted in time segments. Students will enter the examination area according to the time segment and will be tested.
On May 23rd, the Education Bureau of the District announced the list of students who had passed the recruitment examination on its website. Students can check their exam results online.

The President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, said China has the ability to organize a successful Winter Olympics during a special period.
The Chinese president Xi Jinping expressed his enthusiasm for the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, and was confident that China has the ability to organize a successful Winter Olympics in a special period of time.

When they meet, Kobe Bryant highly praised the Chinese side's excellent organization work and left a deep impression. He was impressed by China's ability to organize a successful Summer Olympic Games in 2008 and looked forward to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games. The Black Mamba hoped to use this as an opportunity to further promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the sports field.
During the period of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China and the United States had a special "Olympic Flag" which was passed on between them.
The 1984 Sanya Hot Spring Winter Games was successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Games will open the curtain and present a simple, safe and colorful grand event to the world.
We hope that the cooperation between the two countries in the fields of preparation for winter and summer sports competitions, training of athletes and other aspects will be deepened, and the Chinese Embassy in Botswana will continue to play the role of bridge and promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries. Let the two peoples walk together into the future, and wish the athletes of Botswana a good performance in the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Before the event, the organizing committee of the 10th Annual Best Athlete Award held a ceremony to present the awards. Qui Ping was invited as a special guest and presented the award for the best young athlete.
The video was playing on the spot of the Beijing Winter Olympics Games promotional event.

The State Council has required strengthening the control of infectious diseases and epidemics in coastal cities, and demanded that the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Transport jointly formulate a mechanism for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. - Xinhua Net
The State Council, on December 11, 2019, issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus outbreak in coastal cities. It required that all personnel who had been to or were from coastal cities (including Hong Kong and Macau) should have a negative test for novel coronavirus within 48 hours after leaving the coastal cities. Those who had been to the coastal cities and were going to land-based border cities should also take a negative test for novel coronavirus before entering the land-based border cities.
According to the notification, the time range for the requirements mentioned above is from March 15th, 2021 to March 14th, 2022, as determined by the respective provinces, cities and counties.
In addition, the notification also proposed to study the conditions of the coastal cities and set up the prevention and control of the epidemic buffer zone within the administrative area.
This is an introduction of the person in charge of the National Health and Health Control System. For some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the two sides often have frequent exchanges of people.
Implementing a differentiated management policy for infectious diseases, transforming the single barrier of defense into two barriers, is expected to achieve the relocation of the border, reduce the pressure of the infectious diseases, and minimize the social impact and social cost.
In recent years, there have been multiple cases of locally-transmitted cases of infectious diseases in our country, with most of them originating from outside the country.
The notice mentioned above pointed out that some places had been infected with the virus, resulting in inadequate, high-risk personnel management, irregular periodic testing, ineffective cold chain management, and poorly located and unsupervised cluster sites. In addition, there were also problems such as inadequate scientific preparedness and inadequate emergency treatment.
Notifications are required from the perfecting of the city's prevention and control system of infectious diseases, strengthening the prevention and warning system, implementing border control measures, and improving the weak links of the city's prevention and control. Stay vigilant and scientifically handle the prevention and control work, tightly seal the border and strengthen the defense line.
Notice emphasizing that all cities along the coast should synchronize their work on epidemic control and population health protection, publish and regularly update the hotline for population health protection, regularly check the basic living supplies and prices, and actively respond to and reflect the public's emerging problems.
According to the notice, the cities specified include open land, water and airports. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, cities), cities (districts, counties, flags) and cities (provinces, autonomous regions, cities). It is necessary to be notified in a timely manner according to the needs of prevention and control.

The truth about the Chinese military for 20 years of spilling blood and guts - China News.
This video is from the Oil Ministry.
On December 11th, an oil platform named "The Killing Machine" caused a great deal of attention on the web.
This film describes how the United States waged the "anti-terror" war in Afghanistan to forcefully spread American democracy. Throughout 20 years of poverty, thirst for power, and indiscriminate killing, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were ruthlessly suppressed, committing all kinds of human rights violations.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, twisting the human nature, establishing a murderous gang.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed millions of Afghanistan civilians without remorse.
The U.S. military has established a "black prison" to torture and humiliate "suspected criminals".
The more people commit evil acts, the more hatred is aroused among the Afghans.
Just as the video said, the American "anti-fear" war is getting more and more intense.
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to Afghanistan, but only left it with an endless cycle of violence and destruction.
Slapping the TV, let's uncover the truth of America's "anti-terror" hype, and expose its fake democracy's hypocritical facade!
You unintentionally stumbled upon the next article, discussing why this client wants to hire a warehouse storage company which is not within their business scope, but still within their service range. This article may help explain why the client wants to do so.
I have visited many milk powder factories and got in contact with many milk powder production lines.
In reality, the materials of pouches and earrings are the same, without any difference.
Why is the warranty period of a bag with a detachable liner longer than two years, while the warranty period of a bag without a liner is only one year?
Why is the price of the two so different?
In fact, many consumers, or even mothers' age group, believe that the quality is better than the same material.
In reality, the raw material is the same, but people think that what is expensive is good.
Consumers who have this kind of mindset will have a different reaction after they eat. Some may feel differently about the taste or smell of the food.
Now let me tell you the reason why we should listen to expensive things first. Where is the expensive thing?
Why is the price of their raw materials so different?
Because most factories consider the price of the product when setting the price, consumers find it difficult to accept, which means that factories will generate low profits or even suffer losses. What can factories do to survive?
Therefore, they were able to raise their prices on the hearing aid market, giving them a huge advantage in terms of profit margin.
Therefore, most of the factories are promoting the listening earphone rather than the pouch.
Advertising expenses for factories each year can range from a few million to even billions of yuan. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine and know.
As society develops, marketing costs are constantly increasing. For example, expenses related to promotional staff in shopping centers, fees for displaying products, and advertising costs are all on the rise.
Therefore, each factory is constantly introducing new products, and the prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is due to the increasing cost of marketing.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of increasing raw materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan.
There is still a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, without hesitation, accompanied by doctors from the hospital to help promote the product, from the earnings of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
Related laws in China are absolutely forbidden to operate in such a manner, in fact, this kind of behavior is akin to harassing consumers.
Suggest that everyone keep a can of milk powder in their home before buying a can of milk powder and store it in a can, which can save money, increase the storage and sealing properties, and have no impact on children.

Don't be fooled by the tricksters who try to stop the runners at the starting line.
When browsing books at a bookstore, you can often feel the thrill of success from the exciting books.
Today's successful books and magazines are often based on the "best practices" principle ‚Äî they first assume or hint that you can "do it" and then tell you what needs to be done.
Equal to saying a few words about the most important and fundamental circle.
Since they all have this common trait, either they must be worked hard to reach the best outcome, or they must be worked loosely to achieve nothing, or they may be 100 or 0, or you may climb the Tai Mountain or stay at the origin loosely.
This kind of "best practice" will make everyone admit "correct without comparison" but 99% of people will be fooled and run at the starting line.
Because this kind of thinking can be described as a "you must suffer to reach your goals, rebuild yourself, and undergo a 180-degree change", it is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who adhere to the traditional rules, such as the prohibition of change, you have to shout at them from the side: "You must change!" Without doubt, this is an act of cheating and bullying.
Most people will hesitate before making any changes, either out of fear or due to the short-lived excitement of the moment. Some may be brave enough to take the first step, but eventually they will succumb to the hardships of the transformation and fall back into their old habits.
The renowned soundtrack of "From Tomorrow" starring Jackie Chan was universally acclaimed for its classic portrayal of humanity.
The greatest challenge of the "Best Principle" is that the door threshold is too high, which often exceeds the capacity of ordinary people and makes most people "wondering and yearning".
Perhaps, ‚ÄúFollowing the Golden Rule‚Äù is one of the paths that can lead more people to success.
The core of the principle of "Less is More" is to encou The 2018-2019 school year is off to a great start! We are excited to welcome new students and families to our school community and to welcome back our returning students and families. We are looking forward to a successful and rewarding year.We would like to take this opportunity to remind our families of our expectations for student behavior. We expect all students to be respectful and courteous to their peers, teachers, and staff. We also expect students to come to school prepared to learn, with all necessary materials and supplies. We also ask that students refrain from using cell phones and other electronic devices during the school day.We look forward to working together with our families to ensure that our students have a successful and rewarding school year. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Whatever you do, it will be better than not doing anything.
Due to the decrease in the severity of the door knob, the possibility of ordinary people to persist indefatigably has increased, and thus success is likely to be achieved with persistence.
Only by following the "successful principle" can success be achieved. The road is long and winding, but it has already been traversed.
Although it is advertised as the ‚Äúbest principle‚Äù and appears to be successful on the surface, it is ultimately able to inspire only a few; whereas the ‚Äúsecond best principle‚Äù can effectively inspire more people, allowing them to benefit more.

The amount of resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake will increase by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 11.4%. - Xinhua Net
The State Administration of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Xinning County, Qinghai Province, announced on December 11th that the total amount of fish in the lake had increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, an increase of 40% compared to the initial protection in 2002.
The famous fish species "Sinking Fish" in the Qinghai Lake is a special fish in the lake, which has great importance to the ecosystem of the Qinghai Lake. It plays a significant role in safeguarding the "Water-Fish-Bird" ecological chain and promoting the biological diversity of the lake.
During the 60s and 70s of the 20th century, human activities such as large-scale fishing, overfishing, and uncontrolled breeding of aquatic animals had a severe impact on the environment of the Qinghai Lake, leading to a sharp decrease in the number of the lake's fish resources. In 2002, the total amount of fish resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Red Data Book listed the Qinghai Lake Monster as an endangered species.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has been implementing the ban on fishing in the Qinghai Lake and its surrounding river and tributaries, as well as prohibiting any unit, group or individual from catching, buying or selling the fish and its products.
Meanwhile, we can also take measures such as increasing the flow of rivers and streams, clearing the Qinghai Lake and designing a reasonable fish passage to enhance the protection force. As the resources of Qinghai Lake are gradually increasing, the yield will be further improved.
This is an introduction to the farming village of Longyangxia, located in Qinghai Province, China. It has been implementing artificial breeding and releasing fish into the lake since 2013, resulting in a contribution rate of 23%.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and functional area for the prevention and control of the westward desertification.
In order to protect the Three Gorges, Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau ecosystems, the water and wildlife of the area, the Qinghai government has released a series of bans on fishing and hunting in the Yangtze, Yellow and Qinghai Lake since 2017. This has resulted in the construction of a comprehensive ban on fishing and hunting in the area, forming the "One River, One Lake, One Gorge" system.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I had to stuff into the bag. It was cold outside.
Do you mean that the goods are stored in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I thought it was stolen, but it was actually our people who took it away. Thanks.
It has been 1 hour already, and they still haven't sent it.
I just read a whole article about how to write fake news, and it was too long.
Give unknowing men a taste of health.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will go through menopause around 50 years old.
After ensuring good health of the body, one can compare the monthly cycle more regularly.
Although it is not the rule to predict the exact date, it is usually about one week apart. We need to prepare in advance and sometimes the mood difference can cause a turnaround (suddenly the forecast is good for a few days).
The severity of time, space, and pain is different for each person; some people need three days, some people need one week; some people have little blood, some people have a lot of blood loss; some people have no reaction, some people are in agony and need to be carried to the hospital and get medical help; the severity of the pain changes with time, and it does not represent the strength of a person.
During the 24 hours within which the full moon is at its peak, the only thing one can do is to use a sanitary towel or a piece of cloth to stop the bleeding and prevent it from reaching the clothes or furniture.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins, which begins right before your period and peaks during your period. Eating brunch can help reduce menstrual cramps, but once the cramps have started, there's nothing else that can be done.
Due to excessive release of blood and prostaglandins before menstruation, it is easy to get a painful period.
If you reach the period, it's impossible to hide your belly, so you'd better come to the clinic as soon as possible.
The best time to change a sanitary napkin is every three to four hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, eliminate sleep time, and the worst case is to change six times a day, which is equivalent to 42 pieces per month, and if you add the pre-prepared pieces, it may be up to 50 pieces per month.
(This should be changed to, "Washable cloths are not necessary to be changed often, usually after five or six hours, and can be changed up to eight hours.")
During the full moon and the period of menstruation, the chance of experiencing strong emotions is higher, and the mood may be unstable due to hormonal changes. This can be very overwhelming, and it can be difficult to take care of yourself.
But the official crime rate data can see the female control feeling ability is very high, and will not borrow the problem of feeling.
The fluid is not only blood, but also contains endometrial tissue that has been shed.
After the conclusion of the monthly ritual, the inner membrane of the child's room became thin, and then slowly became thick. This can be understood as the child's room is a house, and each month is prepared to receive guests (the inner membrane becomes thick). If there is no guest, it will be demolished (the monthly ritual is performed) and a new house will be built in the next month.
The monthly cycle is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with each month lasting 24 hours of bleeding and abdominal pain and cramps. Who would want to suffer this?
However, people are able to be born due to their mother's hard work in preparation for their first visit to this world. We should all be grateful to our mothers for their diligent effort in going through the monthly cycle.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed by society, which told them it was immoral and shamed them. Everyone thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone feels that preparing for pregnancy and childbirth is an evil thing, if they think that women's bodies are for that purpose, they shouldn't say it out loud in public. Stand up, girls, and don't think that way. This man has never experienced it before and will never go through it. Men, don't forget your duty and be so unjust. How could you possibly understand such an attitude?
Finally, give it a try, sisters! Health care cloths are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and it's quite disappointing.
You should also book a table for them to eat.
The store was very busy and chaotic. Everyone needed to check their products carefully before they left the store.
Is your electricity bill too high because of your feet?
Choosing the suitable foot bath can bring you good health effects. Today, the National Beauty Small Editor will answer this question and hope to help friends.
As people's health awareness has been strengthened, the popularity of foot baths has been increasing rapidly. On the market, a variety of products ranging from a few dozen yuan to thousands of yuan have been presented, providing consumers with a great selection space.
On related data tables, compared with traditional home appliances, the health care-related home appliances such as sauna bags have seen a rapid growth in sales, but sauna bags lack special industry standards, resulting in a certain safety hazard.
In the water with electricity, it's really dangerous!
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his parents on their birthday, but when his parents tried to use it, they felt a burning sensation on their feet.
When Mr. Li first started using the vibrating function of the bath tub, he didn't expect it to cause such a stir. He was shocked when the vibrating function was suddenly turned off and he felt a strange sensation in his feet. His father said it was like a massage.
Mr. Li tried using an electric brush, but to his surprise, the brush lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to discover that the water in the bathtub was carrying electricity.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had to give up the massage chair and the hot tub. Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that the old and popular foot bath which was set in the highest temperature nowadays has no clear industry standard in terms of application, population and material safety.
However, a general rule of thumb is that electric baths and basins will not have any problems, but it does not exclude a few products from the factory without strict inspection.
Therefore, when purchasing a massage chair, choose a foot bath basin with separate parts.
Separating water and electricity can cause no safety hazards.
You can take a pencil test anytime.
The 13th China Tea Expo opened in Wenzhou - Vision Point - Hunan Daily - Wenzhou Edition - China Voice Online
The 13th China Tea Industry Expo and the Introduction of New Techniques for Processing and Marketing of Red Tea was held in the International Exhibition Center of Hunan Province on December 10th, 2019. The event showcased the tea industry, introduced new tea technologies, and spread the tea culture, accelerating the target of the billion-dollar tea industry.
The Vice Chairman of the China National Supply-and-Demand Strategy Joint Committee, Mr. Huan Shunli, and the Vice Chairman of the People's Provincial Committee, Ms. Yao Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu from the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced the origin of the Red Tea at the opening ceremony, and infused a new dynamism into the ‚ÄúFive-Colored Xiang Tea‚Äù.
In recent years, the provincial government and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the development of the billion-dollar Chaoshan tea industry, and forming the "Three Teas and Five Colors" development framework.
The tea industry in the province has seen great innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main forces driving the development of the tea category. The tea-growing region is pushing for tea tourism and integration, leading to an increase in tea production and revenue.
The wind and water flow in circles, and the red tea has gained new strength.
According to tea experts, once the green tea is harvested, the red tea and black tea can be produced. This will bring in an income for the tea farmers throughout the year, and the tea garden's value will continuously increase.
At the ceremony, the company was granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark and enjoyed the joy of rediscovering the "source of the Hunan Red Tea".
At the New Tea Expo Hall in Fujian, a renowned tea merchant from China saw a special kind of tea called "Ice Cream Tea" from the high mountain region. He immediately placed an order.
The Chairman of the Tea Industry Association said, "Currently, the market for tea leaves is affected by various factors such as the epidemic and the weather, but from the Tea Expo, it is obvious that the tea industry is still flourishing and full of vitality."
A cup of freshly brewed red tea, injected with the essence of tea culture, brings a warm and vibrant atmosphere. The birth of the Xiang tea industry ushers in a new spring.

You have to pay for everything, even for a single thing.
You should go to the restaurant and order something.
I would rather not go downstairs to buy things, so I end up spending so much money on things to be sold outside.
Ding Zi Liang: Zhi You Ren. (This is a phrase meaning "Sorry, I can't help you.")
Throughout the 30 years since the disaster, my family and I have been deeply grateful for the unconditional help from all of our friends both at home and abroad. In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have been providing continuous assistance since 1994.
Most elderly parents who encountered difficulties in life have already passed away, leaving their children alone in the world. The children have grown up and become successful in their careers.
You have been so kind to help us through the most difficult time of our lives.
The current novel coronavirus pandemic has been ravaging the world for months, and most donors have already exhausted their contributions.
Therefore, I humbly request you to kindly stop giving us hard time‚Äî‚Äîthe Mothers of the Motherland. This is a humanitarian act of rescue and assistance. It should have a perfect ending.
I will forever engrave your love in my heart and your justice will be forever etched in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to use this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the International Federation for China Social Services (IFCSS) and the Mingni Foundation (MCDF).
During the process of engaging in human rights assistance, the United States-China People's Fund and the Minnesotan China Partnership are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often having to cross paths.

Money can never be sent to the victims of the June 4th incident smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Ding L«éo Shƒ´, a special team was founded to receive and distribute funds for rescue and relief.
In 1998, the MCDF established the 'Sixth Generation Fund for Chinese Orphans', which has been in operation for 11 years since then. In 2009, the MCDF then established the 'Sixth Generation Fund for Chinese Elderly in Distress', and has been continuously executing it until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from the donations made by the alumni and the public after the June 4th Incident in 1989, as well as from the generous contributions of individuals. The Democratic Progressive Party also provided support.
Since 2018, we have received the support of the National Natural Science Foundation for our research on labor reform.
After 31 years, the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the event.
During this period, "China People's Rights" also implemented their humanitarian aid projects independently.
We understand that Ding teacher called for a stop to the June 4th donation, considering the donors. We are indeed some retired people with limited income, so we express our gratitude to Ding teacher.
We will respect the decision of the hard-hit people and terminate this project within two years. We will also restore it as soon as possible when needed.
For those who have been enduring great pain and suffering for many years, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our deepest gratitude and respect.

A programmer's experience sharing.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to seek training in a certain place. But if you don't have the idea of this aspect, it's better to self-study instead. Training costs a lot and it will take 6 months of time to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a good choice, especially for those with self-motivation and weaknesses. Training is a great choice for them.
If you are strong enough to self-motivate and self-regulate, you can choose self-study, but it will be tiring.
Choosing a good training organization is very important.
First, we need to look at the teacher's qualifications of this institution. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions also do not have particularly strong teacher qualifications.
Before selecting this training organization, it is worthwhile to explore it in detail. It is best to explore the students of this organization before making a decision. After all, only the students of this organization know how it is really like. It is also important to understand the quality of the courses offered.
Hi, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your personal situation. There is a big connection between learning this thing and personal situation.
For example, if you are interested in a specific profession, age, or language, you may want to study or pursue a career related to it, such as in a certain city.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many online and offline training institutions that are not bad, but it requires a high investment of time and money, and it also requires a concentrated training of 3-6 months.
However, if it is my situation, it is very convenient to self-study. There are many free learning resources on the internet, such as websites and forums. You can also find many training resources on bÁ´ô. If you can't find resources, you can contact me and get free resources or detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can still afford to pay certain tuition fees and time investments, then it is recommended to attend training centers to learn. This way of learning is not very costly and the teacher explains in great detail, with the help of people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, there is help in planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training institutions will sign a job agreement with you, with an internal recommendation bonus and referral to companies after the study, which can greatly reduce the job interview process.
This is my opinion, which is based on my limited understanding of your situation. I have only briefly described it, so if you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I arrived at the store 1 minute before, and I saw it in the App.
What is it called?
You haven't finished yet. What are you doing?
Our company provides a variety of services including installation, cleaning, maintenance, wall hanging, clothes dryer, air conditioner, furnace, oil burner, lighting fixture, and glass polishing. We specialize in home and office services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me a pat on the shoulder. For the effort I have put in toiling hard in life, it is tiring but I must continue.
People who put in effort will never be disappointed in life. Those who love me will pay attention to me and thank those who are silent but show their support.
Life is like this, people only see the results, you have to go through the process yourself, facing life, we are strong and continue, there is no choice, the road can only look back but can not turn back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Keeping clean is work, but it's also a responsibility, and a life of service makes it beautiful and exciting. Service is made special through use of the heart.
Although our work was the dirtiest and most tiring, we still used the most meticulous attitude to clean every corner of the house until it was spotless, and saw the customer's happy smile and proudly raised thumbs up in the end. All the hard work was worth it and we got a great reward in return!
My Daily Work
I am here to fulfill your requirements.
Use heart to serve, use heart to clean, keep a beautiful home.
Pay attention to the details, and I will help you to finish the "perfection" of my service. I will serve your family with love.
Keep the house clean and tidy, put up a tree in the courtyard, and provide services at the right place. Cleanliness will reach home.
Cleaning both inside and outside is my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp was beautiful, it would become dull and dim after a long time without being cleaned, and only when it was cleaned could the colors of the lamp shine brightly. Life is also like this.
With heart we can do anything successfully, with meticulousness we can create masterpieces, and with sincerity we are determined to achieve excellence.
Give me a chance and I will make sure you are satisfied with the quality, since the professional is worth trusting and recognition is my greatest motivation!
Everything is not going well down there!
Nevertheless, I will always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, persistence, and effort, I will be better than others, at least a little bit! Let's keep trying!
From the moment the sun rises until the morning, all the good things will begin. May you bring along happiness, luck, health and positive thoughts as you embark on a new day, and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good night.
In the past, happiness was a thing to be possessed, so people strived for it. As they grew older, they realized that happiness is a state of mind, and mastering it made them happy.
Strive to be the most authentic and virtuous version of yourself, walk with courage and no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a clear mind, shining brightly until old age!
Each stage of life brings its own unique challenges.
Many times, your fears were not due to lack of ability, but rather a positive attitude of facing them.
Since you cannot escape, it is better to face it directly.
The more afraid you are, the more difficult it is to overcome; if you face the difficulty boldly, the problem will eventually be defeated.

Among the 27 participating artists from Saudi Arabia, there are various forms of art such as painting, installation, and performance art. 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention, with some using innovative methods to create artworks from recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "The Story of the Mountains and Rivers" (2014), which reconstructed a classic mountain-and-river painting with discarded objects.
Di Liye expressed his hope that the 2019 Double Year Exhibition could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain a better understanding of the cultural and creative industries and the interactive community in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Tian Wen Yu said: "The goal of the Two-Year Exhibition is to create a dialogue between two cultures, allowing the art of Saudi Arabia to be seen in a global context, as well as allowing the audience to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
During the exhibition period, we will also hold a series of lectures, inviting artists, curators and creative industry leaders to share their insights on cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Hello

Second, although the Rightists had a short-lived glory in history, it was due to the fact that they exposed themselves to the sunlight and drank the water, which made them perspire profusely; thus they were easily defeated by the powerful enemy and suffered a crushing blow.
Although the reality is far from ideal, the right-wing has made positive contributions to the social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, the true definition of reality should be set as the standard for developing the economy, advancing science and technology, and promoting political system reform and human rights protection. The positive meaning of the right-wing should not be denied.
Despite not completely agreeing with some of Li Weidong's views, I am very interested in them and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person. This is because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere in his views on Chinese society.
But I reject his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe revolution is inevitable, which will lead to social turmoil, people's suffering, and political instability. In other words, it is futile to expect a foreign power to intervene.
Four, changing or improving China requires perseverance and taking responsibility as a citizen, political plots and schemes are doomed to fail, it is not right-wing.
Let's talk some more.
Left, in reality, is a relic of the era and politics.
If the right has positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts at times of need. Then the left will have nothing to do, because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away.
Five, I recently saw some friends who were upset, angry, and even stole from each other. It was really unpleasant, so I decided not to interfere.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all a waste of time. They're all just a bunch of stubborn, irrational people.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't want to admit that we are wrong. Why do we need to do that?
I tell my friends this way: When people insult you for five inches, when they make fun of your left leg and right dog, it proves our middle path is correct!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but later in life they forget their dreams or pursue them half-heartedly.
As one dreams, one walks slowly, slowly, and eventually slays a dragon.
I think Left-Right is a generalization of constraints and freedom, and China's historical and cultural genes have caused it to be biased Left.
The right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing focuses on control and equality. Both prioritize fairness and safety.

Although I didn't understand it, I still gave it a thumbs up.
What else is there to say? Flowers are already so beautiful.
For the past two years, the US has been imposing sanctions on Huawei's components, not only putting the company into an unprecedented predicament, but also causing "US-based" companies to suffer immense losses.
The US imperialism has been pressuring China's semiconductor industry, requiring domestic enterprises and alliance members to simultaneously lock down the Chinese semiconductor industry, resulting in a direct impact on the global chip supply chain and chip manufacturing enterprises. This has caused a decrease in research and development investment, a decrease in production capacity, and a shortage of global chip supply chains.
Now "chip shortage" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price hikes, almost all industries using chips have been severely affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-authority, more and more countries' technology giants began to walk the "China-ization" road.
In order to tightly control the global semiconductor industry, the US is pulling the strings of the Chinese semiconductor industry's development, recently inviting the US to host the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish the Semiconductor Alliance. Meanwhile, it is also trying to bribe the US domestic giant technology companies, such as Intel, to regain its dominance in the chip field. To this end, it has invested 200 million US dollars in the US state of Arizona to build two wafer fabs. It has also opened up the chip foundry business to foreign companies.
Most people regard this as a game, but it can cause a certain amount of impact on the Taiwan power grid and may even steal the "rice bowl" of Taiwan.
This is because Intel, the giant in the semiconductor industry, has been investing in the Chinese market for decades and has accumulated a large number of talents and technological reserves. It is inevitable that Intel will quickly rise and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor in a short period of time.
However, regarding Intel's decision, Taiwan's chip pioneer Zhang Zong-mian showed no regret.
At the "2021 Teacher's Smart Bank" forum held in April this year, Zhang Chunguang's speech was shocking, and he openly criticized Intel for its investment in the factory, saying that Intel was "building a factory for contractors".
Zhang Chunguang's determination to invade the lucrative circle of the gaming industry was fueled by his long-standing grudge against 30 years of accumulated resentment and animosity towards Intel.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always at the forefront of the US semiconductor industry, occupying a position of global leadership. It was the undisputed champion of the world's emerging microelectronics industry.
Throughout the 80s, the world's semi-conductor high-end chips were dominated by a few powerful players.
During the semiconductor industry's IDM era, chip design, manufacturing and packaging were all completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a pattern makes some small enterprises unable to bear the burden and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only wish but not afford the cost of constructing a large-scale production line.
After feeling the market demand, the chip industry began to appear in the 80s, and the cooperation of subcontracting began to emerge. In 1984, Zhang Chung-Ming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in the production of chips.
After a short while, Zhang Chang's dream became a reality. Taishan Electricity started to operate.
The company has been focusing on the production of jewelry processing for a long time and has not designed any products. It only provides outsourcing services for jewelry manufacturing.
When Tsinghua University was just established, it was a small and weak university in front of the giant and powerful Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chunguang had once found Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor was only in the chip manufacturing industry, it had some doubts and rejected the investment.
Zhang Chunguang also recognized that at that time, Intel's foundry services were not available.
I never thought that when I watched the documentary about the giant in the jewelry industry, I would have to start doing jewelry repairs as well.
Therefore, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when Intel entered the Jade Circle.
Now the value of Taiwan's chip industry has exceeded Intel.
Facing the fierce competition in the Taiwan market, Intel is also unwilling to be passive and complacent.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor has already reached 3nm chip-making, while Intel is still lingering at 14nm from 7 years ago.
Wanting to escape the reality is not easy.
He didn't wait.
I placed the order at 19:06 and it took 2 hours.
Today, let's take a look at some [weird] hot topics.
What is normal emotional behavior?
Three hot topics randomly chosen are the Chinese New Year dragon-raising ceremony, the price hike of good-looking friends, and the event of shopping spree. The emotional spreading formed a wave peak and then [the index] fell down (smooth curve). If the emotion is generated again, it will have a small hump peak.
It looks like the emotional model displayed on the official website of the network has a great difference with the one on the network.
What is the emotion of abnormality?
Six hot spots were randomly chosen from the same event, presenting a [[mountain peak shape]], [[tooth shape]], and [[cliff shape]].
[Cultivation Status] Quickly heating up, it caused a lot of attention from the public; [Cyclical Heating] Ensuring the topic remained hot, it kept the topic at the forefront; [Breaking Point] It caused a mass exodus, demonstrating its full functionality, and heading to a new mission and battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave is exactly the same as the valley of the other event, only a few seconds apart. It is inevitable that the united forces of the water army will be deployed to the new mission, and the offensive will be launched.
Professionalization of the Dark Gate is evident: Several dozen hotspots have emerged simultaneously on the rankings, attracting attention from various quarters - some for their innovative strategies, some for their responsibility, some for their competitive spirit, some for their attempts to shift the paradigm, some for their impact on cognition, some for their misleading judgement, some for their stimulation of emotions, and some for their meticulous planning and execution of tactics. Dark producers have also been meticulously segmenting their accounts and nodes, thus making it difficult to spread the sentiment.
Transmission is a science, opening up a new perspective, owning the emotional factors and only observing the data, the black box will be unveiled.
Whatever path we take, we will leave behind a trace of our journey. Together, we can unearth these traces.
The source of the data is the Hot Seat Time Machine.
A case of plague was discovered in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China for the first time.

After being treated in a hospital, both patients' test results became negative and they have returned to their respective homes.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced on January 10th that three cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been confirmed.
These 3 people are students. They all came back from abroad traveling in the beginning of the month. Due to their weakness, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent and control the spread of the virus, the government has been constantly increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers aged 12 and above who arrived by plane must pay for and go through a mandatory X-ray inspection at the airport.

Because of trust, I first introduced my friend. Therefore, I chose to take a look at the basic budget of 700,000 yuan for the initial stage of my house.
As soon as he entered the store, he began to perform a series of scams.
I was the first time to the store just showed them my floor plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they still could give me the price of my 135 square feet 7 million yuan house. They probably didn't even know what brand of material they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you away and force you to give them the money. (This money is gone forever unless you have enough experience and argue with them.)
When negotiating for a car loan, they will invite their manager to tell you. If you can pay off the loan today, you will get a great discount.
This is an example of being scammed out of a lot of money. I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late.
He gave me an estimate of 7 million without including the cost of water and electricity, as well as any doors or closets. The bathroom was not included in the estimate.
Their service fees are much higher than other companies' fees.
I lost trust in this company and didn't know what to expect at the beginning. So I just signed the contract without making things clear.
When I went to ask them to return the money, they displayed a very experienced mannerism, with a specialized team to face you.
Regardless of how it happened, the customer's problem was ultimately their own fault. They had no right to blame anyone else.
Responsibility for different types of refunds, as well as many details, do not want to speak all at once, it is all tears, do not choose them, because my friends found them to repair the house is also poor quality, later calculate different fees.
The original dragon costumes were used to deceive people in the past, but now they have been replaced by beautiful ones. It seems to have shut down again, but it has been changed to something else.
Therefore, everyone should choose a reliable company to do the decoration of the house.

Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?

The sky is full of stars, the constellation of the twins, and a stream of star rain will arrive on the 14th day of the Chinese lunar calendar. It will be a very grandiose day.
On December 12th, 2018, the renowned Chinese astronomer Professor Zhou Runcheng gave a special introduction to the audience at the New China News Agency in Tianjin. He shared his knowledge about the last and most grandiose meteor shower of the year, the Twin Zeta Ursid meteor shower, which will be arriving on the night of December 14th. Those who are fond of meteor showers can observe it after the night.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing photographed a double-star rainbow in Qinghai on December 13th, 2018.
Most of the periodic comets that produce meteor showers are members of the Solar System's Oort cloud, but the mother of the Geminid meteor shower is a 3200-numbered Kuiper belt object, a type of trans-Neptunian object.
The second-known meteor shower is the Zodiac Rain, which is also known as the Zodiac Rainfall. It is not the result of a comet or asteroid, but is instead believed to be the result of a planetary collision.
Dr. Peng Xin of the Tianjin Astronomical Society gave a lecture on the "Double Zeta" meteor shower, which usually appears in the last days of the year and can be seen from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is renowned for its large flow rate and stable performance. It is often compared to the Chinese constellation of the same name, and is one of the three great meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
The most prominent feature of the Double Star Rainfall is its slow speed of the meteorites, rich color, and plenty of fireballs. It is suitable for both visual and photographic beginners in astronomy.
Tens of thousands of amateur astronomers in Tianjin City, China, gathered on December 13, 2020 to photograph the double zeta Ursa Minorids meteor shower.
The meteor shower of the year 2019 will arrive on December 14th or 15th at around 15:00 UT. According to the prediction, the ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors per hour seen at the zenith) will be 150.
Recommend a star chart for the constellation of the Twins.
Last year, the double-star constellation gave people a deep impression, but this year's double-star constellation will be affected by the moonlight interference, and the spectacular level will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th day of the lunar month, the moon is in its full phase, shining brightly in the night sky. This may cause some interference for those trying to observe the moon, but it will become easier to observe later in the night when the moon is at its brightest. This is also the time when the Double Star and the Zodiac constellations are most visible, as the radiation point of the stars will be higher than usual.
Enjoying the star shower with friends can be done after the midnight moonfall, but be aware of the cold and take measures to keep warm.
How can we observe more stars efficiently?
It is not advisable to conduct observations in urban areas, but one can choose to observe from a mountain, a valley, or a rural area facing east, and wait patiently until the moon falls before conducting the observation.
The important thing to note is that the flow of rainfall towards each direction from the Double Star is very large. When observing, one does not need to constantly fixate on the Double Star's radiation point.

The phoenix awakened and reminded him.
What differences exist between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional television that the host mentioned should be referring to liquid crystal television, while the difference between plasma and liquid crystal televisions in the market positioning mainly consists of two points:
The first one is laser TV, focusing on the large-screen market.
Compared to the liquid crystal television market, the laser television market is more focused, as laser television is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream liquid crystal TV size is from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is usually above 75 inches, with the maximum size of over 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for a large-screen TV.
In recent years, the global demand and sales of laser TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for over 60% of the total 80-inch and above TV market.
According to the prediction of the Chinese market, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 20
The reason why we have achieved such good results at the large market is due to the excellent performance of our laser TV in the protection eyewear department.
Based on the principle of laser television imaging, the light from the laser source is reflected instead of directly entering the eye. Compared to the backlight of a liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Shanghai Institute of Standardization and Quality Control, in collaboration with the Beijing Ophthalmology Hospital, conducted a rigorous comparison experiment of viewing both laser and liquid crystal televisions under the same conditions. 144 data sets were collected.
Data verification: Laser TVs possess very strong eye protection features, even in certain aspects exhibiting certain improvement effects.
With the increasing awareness of eye health, laser eye surgery has become more and more popular. Not only did it take advantage of the eye health benefits, but it also opened up a new market in the colorful world of cosmetic surgery.
The second generation of laser TVs will focus on the high-end market.
With the price of liquid crystal televisions constantly exploring the opposite direction, the price of current market sales of laser TVs are generally above one million yuan, with the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
What is the price of this expensive laser TV?
Ken is rational.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
By taking advantage of the advanced technology of laser projection, the distance between the projector and the screen can be greatly shortened, allowing for a 100-inch experience within a short distance. The space required is small, and the host is small and compact.
In the brightness aspect, a big brand laser TV can reach above 2000 lumens.
Adding the heating element reduces the power consumption, which in turn reduces the wear and tear on the equipment, and extends the lifespan of the TV.
Outside of this, there are many high-end laser TV models that also feature 4K Ultra High Definition picture quality, Artificial Intelligence systems, and Imitation Glass panels, providing users with an even more exhilarating visual and audio experience.
Talking about the fake needs and dividing the real needs into products, discussing the quality and investment of the product, laser TV is not a game for the audience, considering the large screen and watching environment, it is possible to try, everything has its own advantages and disadvantages, and then judge by yourself.
A simple explanation, the wide angle lens is close to the screen, it is inevitable to use the expensive wide angle lens and reflection mirror, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block part of the environment light, using the fabric of Fengshui, the price is expensive, the size of 80 cm can be exchanged for 65 cm of liquid crystal.
There is still one point I want to emphasize. I particularly detest the practice of some merchants who put up a mirror on the screen and charge people for viewing it. This is not only cheating people, but also harmful to people's eyesight. The light from the mirror reflects directly into the eyes, while the eyes can't see any light from the mirror. Even if the light is dim, the eyes will be harmed. The same is true for the liquid crystal TV. It is also "directly" illuminated by the mirror, so why do people open the TV and get illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will never be completed.
The hot spot effect of the curtain was ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from one corner. That was really difficult to bear.
The store chooses the best quality products and offers a wide range of photography services. It is currently looking for a suitable store location.
After I added a date to my WeChat appointment, my girlfriend just sent me the available times she had chosen, which was very efficient.
Before entering the store, I checked out the photos taken inside. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The shooting style involved was also diverse.
After I had finished chatting with my friend and trying on two outfits, I finally settled on a style and posed for the photographer. He directed me to move and adjust the props, paying attention to every detail.
However, due to the lack of specific shooting ideas, the photos I took were not what I wanted. Nevertheless, they should be visually appealing.
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, and have a chance to communicate with the model. It felt like the photographer was very attentive to details.
The makeover took about a month, and it was worth the wait~
The King of Photography Shoot was a great success! Everyone was able to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed in.
In the end, he chose a black blazer, experiencing a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer is a younger brother of 95, and he feels slightly more experienced but still a bit green. He hopes to give more advice in the future after more shooting experiences. The shooting process was quite enjoyable.
The store specializes in the selection of high-quality photographic products and provides excellent services.
I've already visited the homepage, so I'm here to check out Queenie~
I went to the store first and filled in my name and phone number, then chose clothing, wedding dresses were available, and it was very patient and hardworking. Finally, I chose the clothes and had a makeover for a long time. The service attitude was also good. Later, I took a picture and learned how to pose, which was almost the same as the original picture. It felt like half a month, and then I received the pictures three days later. It felt like the original picture.
The environment is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
The makeup spot is not far away, there is a photography backdrop inside.
[Service] Very hot and very attentive.
The instructor was very patient.
The photographer will also be very attentive in teaching you the movements.
The photographer will also propose retouching if you are not satisfied.
Experience has shown that the eyes may become slightly protruding, the original double eyelid has been replaced by a triple eyelid.
Even my eyebrows were shaved off, which made me feel a bit awkward for daily life without eyebrows.
The picture was taken after 10 minutes, but the result of the P-picture was not satisfactory. It felt like there were too many layers of eye makeup on.
Because it was not very clear what style to choose, she tried two different outfits. In the end, she chose the black formal dress.
After choosing the clothes, the makeover began. The stylist and the makeup artist were super patient and helped me to get the perfect result.
After getting dressed and doing makeup, I started to take pictures. The photographer had full control of my poses and expressions throughout the process, which was very smooth and relaxed.
After finishing the photoshoot, he chose four favorite pictures and showed them to his brother. The ending was very happy and fulfilling.
I have not received any replies for 3 days due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, thus I cannot join #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card when paying.
I have to pay shipping fee every time.
Can I pay my monthly fee in installments? After you finish the investigation, can I pay the remaining fee?
Should one buy insurance when buying a small umbrella?
Small umbrella is a platform of insurance and financial services over the internet.
According to the conditions set forth in the Insurance Regulatory Authority's Guidance on Establishing Insurance Intermediary Companies (2015 Revision): To become an insurance intermediary company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, founding person, and no serious violations of law in the past three years; the minimum capital requirement is 5000 yuan; and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Authority.
This three-tiered system is actually quite complicated. It requires strength and perseverance to go through the process. Insurance companies need to have a good investment attitude and be approved by the relevant government departments. Shareholders must also take a prudent attitude. In short, it is not an easy task for any insurance company to achieve.
At this point, it's not bad, it's worth believing in.
From insurance products, we can see that Small Rain Umbrella Insurance is a kind of insurance marketplace, where many companies' star products are being sold, such as the latest Superstar and Thai Superstar 5th edition products, with the guarantee of both parties being insured and the insurance company being responsible for the insured. Small Rain Umbrella Insurance is only a mediator, without any doubt of its trustworthiness.
From the perspective of cost structure: Internet platforms, due to the absence of operating costs of traditional businesses, the cost of personnel and the cost of capital, the Internet product price is generally higher, and the cost structure is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the burden of paying for people, and at the same time can maximize the flexibility of insurance premiums.
This point is still very good.
You can consider it.
From the perspective of insurance professionals, this point is particularly important, as the insurance industry requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health and professional areas. Insurance professionals often add their own subjective views when self-insuring, which can easily lead to misrepresentation and even fraud.
I have done insurance sales over the phone for "Tencent Weibo" (just like Little Umbrella, it is an internet insurance platform). I am very responsible for telling you this.
Insurance for the Internet is real, but it is still risky. Unprofessional individuals can be found on the Internet, but there are also many scammers. There are no professional sales personnel on the Internet, and there are many misleading sales.
For example, if you buy insurance for 600 million yuan, you can get a free mobile phone and receive 6 million yuan of accident insurance. These marketing strategies have been successful, but they are not sustainable. The first month is free, but the second month requires payment according to the normal fee. Many customers are confused and do not know why they have to pay for the insurance they bought.
I can buy 1 block of gold with 100,000 RMB, and the insurance company will pay 600 million RMB (the whole world is shocked).
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If you win a prize, you don't exchange it and nobody will remind you.
For those who are investing in insurance, it's just another hole in the ground. If you only rely on this, without any other business risks, what if the real disaster happens? 6 million can't solve the problem, and it won't solve the problem in the future. Life will be full of running and hiding.
At present, the country is also vigorously combating the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, it is advisable to look at the platform, there is no problem, the product also has no problem, the problem is the professional degree and professionalism of the staff.
Recommendations for choosing an insurance agent should be considered carefully, as there are many insurance companies offering a wide range of products, and customers have more choices and better products than online products.
I have helped 59 online customers by providing support, guaranteeing product quality, and saving up to 2000-3000 RMB per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an experienced insurance broker with over 3 years of business management training and customer service experience. I have worked with over 100 insurance companies and served more than 1000 businesses. Before proposing a policy, I will carefully assess customer needs and tailor a suitable insurance product. During the policy period, I will strive to secure the best coverage for the customer and make sure all the paperwork is in order. After the policy is in place, I will handle all the paperwork and make sure the customer is worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, online insurance is when a person clicks on the insurance link and can complete the entire insurance process autonomously.
During this process, neither the insured nor the insurance agent needs to sign any documents, and all steps can be completed by the insured himself.
Although there is no "ceremony feeling" in online insurance, even the paper contracts of printing out the insurance policy may not exist, but it will not affect the validity and legality of the electronic contracts.
This kind of pattern is similar to the traditional telephone sales job, but buying insurance will bring a fatal problem‚Äî‚Äîthe subsequent service may not meet the expectation.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades, so when we purchase insurance, should we carefully consider and choose a reliable "intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services in many years?
How can I contact the delivery staff?
I have already finished the task in 3 minutes.
Is it supposed to give me compensation?
I said I wanted to open the door and send the goods.
But that guy just gave it to the door, and then people just walked away.
The gift was wrong.
Your hands have already taken my one piece of overseas sale, but still waiting for it until now.
My order has been received at 19:25, but they are still reluctant to ship out.
Did you buy everything? Do you need to go to other stores to buy something else?
How do I do it?
Your horse has gone to where?
Do you still need to wait?
I am sending a bill.
Good, you didn't cancel, so I called the police.
However, my food may cause safety and health problems.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of discrimination and ridicule, and cannot accept any form of physical or verbal attack.
In the civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't see the political parties and factions, you must suppress it first, which is an uncivilized behavior.
From you I started to send friend requests, then I posted a flirty thread on your wall, and finally I tried to publish your home address and father's name on social media. I have already taken an unresponsive attitude.
After you tagged me, you continued to talk about me behind my back in a malicious and insidious manner. You discussed my private matters, such as my shyness, embarrassment, and physical appearance. You even talked about my sleeping and eating habits. All of this made me feel so uncomfortable and humiliated.
After I sent you the picture, I received many messages from your friends, including some related to your face and some offensive comments.
I'm sorry, as a female student, I can't keep silent anymore.
After you upload the news about me reporting the police, you have not been caught yet and instead become more and more popular.
Regardless of your political background or identity, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
You can continue this type of provocative, humiliating, shaming, and berating discourse, you can also continue to say that you are only loving and caring for me, you can also continue to think that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is your picture or continue to post all sorts of attacking language.
I can't stop you.
Even if I don't recognize you, I don't want to recognize you. My appearance and body are not something that needs your evaluation.
I was so ashamed that I felt like no one would want to be friends with me after what I had done.
My friend asked me, is it still good?
I said hello, you will not believe it.
I think no one can be so humiliated afterward that they can't still say they're okay.
Regardless of work, society, politics, or business, only those people who lack basic human decency will choose to harm any woman in such a manner.
I believe, the path of righteousness is within everyone's heart.
I have cut and pasted part of the message to give to everyone for review.
Your own post should not be copied by others.
You are the enemy of civilization.

The People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum.

The Changjiang River Basin has achieved integrated green service coverage on the water.
On December 11th, 2019, the reporter Wang Xian from Chengdu visited the newly-built Wuhan Green-service Area on the Yangtze River. This is the second green-service area after the successful operation of the Fourth Green-service Area in Chengdu. It is the official start of the green-service area operation along the Yangtze River.
This area has covered the entire length of the Yangtze River, from upstream to downstream.
The Vice Chairman of the Communications and Transportation Department, Mr. Zhu Jianhua, introduced the management of the 10 green service areas on the Yangtze River and the lower reaches.

The US Navy's three aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China and can be seen in the latest satellite images. The most powerful weapon in the US arsenal is visible and can be accessed from the disputed island of Diaoyu. This is a significant signal to the region's US allies and adversaries.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, on January 9th, the United States Navy's "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier was found in the Balabac Strait.
The Sunda Strait, connecting the Java Sea and the South China Sea, is a strategic location in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
This platform has predicted that the ‚ÄúCarlson Wagonlit‚Äù will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the Carl-Gustafson aircraft carrier, the first time to load F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey transport aircraft for deployment.
The U.S. Navy has two aircraft carriers operating in the South China Sea. Besides the Carl Vinson, there is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which was deployed from the United States on January 3rd.
The F-35C carrier-based aircraft of the US Navy's 314th Fighter Squadron has made its first sortie, attacking the enemy team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy has one other carrier stationed in the Asia-Pacific region: the ‚ÄúRonald Reagan‚Äù (USS Ronald Reagan) in Yokosuka, Japan.
The mothership of the battle group still includes the "Shanghai Lake" and "Stuka Destroyer" class of missile boats and "Sky Whirlwinds" class of anti-ship missile boats.
The United States has deployed three aircraft carriers to the South China Sea, according to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Observation Platform" published on January 17, 2022. The satellite image shows the three aircraft carriers gathering in the vicinity of China.
(@SouthChinaSea Strategic Situation Awareness) The US Navy has deployed its most powerful weapon to the South China Sea for a rare visit. The CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft flew along the route on 17th January 2022.
According to the US cable television news network (CNN) on January 17th, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy weapons store was mysteriously missing from Guam during the weekend.
The nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-733) entered the waters near Guam on Saturday, January 15th. The submarine is part of the United States Navy's Ohio-class submarine fleet and is armed with 20 Trident missiles. It also has several dozen nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and torpedoes.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have been gathering in the South China Sea, making it the most powerful weapon ever seen in the region. Analysts say this is a signal of the tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. submarine has visited Guan Island since 2016, and it is the second time Guan Island has been open to the public since the 1980s.
The Chinese navy has been rapidly expanding its presence in the South China Sea, with a number of military installations being built on disputed islands in recent years.
The island is a popular tourist destination in China.
The U.S. Navy declared in its statement that the "Inner China Delta" class of nuclear-powered submarine had been strengthened during its visit to the South China Sea, demonstrating the U.S. capability, flexibility, and readiness, as well as its commitment to the region's security and stability.
The typical submarine used for boomer operations is called a "Boomer submarine".
The track of the 14 submarines of the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet is usually kept secretly.
The secret of the submarine-launched ballistic missile "Poseidon" has been revealed, making it the most important survival weapon in the world. This system also includes a domestic launch facility for ICBMs in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
Following the recent plunge of Meta, its market value has been evaporated by 2510 million US dollars, and Buckingham responded to the "unprecedented competition" it faced. What is the reason for this?
Meta (originally Facebook) is an advertising company, mainly earning from advertisements. It is today's most successful advertising company, with its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., regardless of what kind of function it is, it is all a Meta flow channel.
Not only this, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many Apps connecting to it through its advertising platform, thus achieving transformation.
However, the times have changed.
Due to the adjustment of the privacy policy of Apple, it is difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertisement spending.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, it will be very obvious to users whether they allow the app to get their information, most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google further sharpens its sword and cuts into the Meta's income, the impact will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor weakened in the Meta's income growth before (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of the company's income comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies engaged in maritime business.
There are about 100 people in the office in Hong Kong, and there are several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas market, and Meta is the only reliable advertising channel for them. Spending a lot of money on it.
One of the major competitors of TT is Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from the Chinese market.
Agents from all over China have been helping each other to advertise in the Chinese language version of Meta, which has been doing very well.
I haven't been specializing in it recently, but I'm sure it will be better than before.
The stage of China's large-scale overseas money burning has already passed.
The third, the expansion of the new flow channel is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, with new platforms such as TT included in it. They are not in the Meta hand anymore.
The biggest problem is not only a decrease in income, but also a lack of growth expectation.
Not only do we need to look at current income from the capital market, but it is also important to consider our expectations for the future.
It was very obvious that the expectations of Meta were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zack Brown talked about ‚ÄúThe Universe‚Äù.
The universe should be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the universe is relatively long, so this story should not be able to support the value of Meta in three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be more difficult than ever for Meta.
Don't look at the face of the book now, it is very bright. Every year there are 1,000 million to 2,000 million US dollars of income, the real sense of danger is very strong, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is nothing good security of the river.
Although his social media presence is currently higher than ever, it is still a popular social media platform, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of TikTok, he has no confidence, and it is a stealthy tactics.
Translating the concept of the universe into a short period of time is impossible, so there is no hope of success, so the risk of facebooks is very dangerous, this is why Zuckenberg changed the name of the company and always looking for new tracks. However, I think his decision is wrong, it is a wrong path.
17th Article: The State shall implement a registration and practice management system for firefighters' qualifications.

The Chinese and Vietnamese armies concluded their joint peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance exercise ‚ÄúPeaceful Responses - 2021‚Äù on the New China News Service.
On December 12th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Vietnam People's Army jointly held the "Peacekeeping Rescue - 2021" exercise in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a delegation to participate in the exercise. All the members of the delegation safely returned to China. This marks the successful completion of the 7-day exercise.
This joint performance was to explore the great topic of humanism in medical rescue and relief. We had to be vigilant and tenacious in our work, and to make sure that every casualty was treated with the utmost care and respect. We had to adhere to the standards of real-life battlefield medical treatment and evacuation, and complete the tasks of joint command and joint rescue, joint field medical treatment, and mass casualty evacuation. This effectively improved the two armies' medical rescue and security capabilities.
After practicing hard, I was able to get the approval of the two armies.
The Vice Chairman of the Exercise Instruction and Supervision Committee of the People's Army of Vietnam, Long Van Xuan, spoke at the conclusion of the exercise, saying that through this exercise, the Vietnamese military doctors have learned the knowledge of exercise organization and professional activities from the Chinese side. They also saw the medical and safety equipment of China.
The results of the exercise proved the professional ability of the two countries' military medical forces in the fields of medical assistance, epidemic control and disaster relief.
The Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Wang Hongguang, expressed that this exercise was a continuation of the successful organization of the Joint Medical Exercise in 2018, which was a great opportunity to explore new ideas and practices. He believed that this exercise had great significance.
During the period of military training, the People's Liberation Army of China donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the people of Vietnam.
