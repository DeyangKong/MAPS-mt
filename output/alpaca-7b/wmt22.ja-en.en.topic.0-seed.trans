I don't want to watch TV anymore...
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was so popular on TV.
Yesterday, I was watching Netflix in Chirori, but it was so boring that even the staff behind me started laughing out loud.
"It's not funny when you're just making a fool of yourself, but it's hilarious when a comedian is doing it," said the man with a smirk.
Even though the staff didn't laugh, the artist's bad attitude made the workplace unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and ordinary. Some of the artists are also unhappy with the attitude.
I can't help but feel a deep sense of admiration for the artist when I see them struggling with their own work.
Even though income is quite low at the moment, I'm trying to make ends meet by selling my art. But it seems like a never-ending task since I'm constantly struggling to find the right words to express my ideas.
There is a tendency for people in the entertainment and media industries to be overrepresented in the public eye, to the point where their presence is becoming excessive.
Although there are some difficult parts in the entertainment industry, artists have to keep trying their best and never give up.

I exchanged the items I purchased at the convenience store without hesitation.
You are expected to have ordered the wireless mouse and it should have arrived with a wired version, so you can return it and get a refund if you wish.
Even though it is difficult to purchase a self-made PC, it is still worth considering since it is a famous place.
I discovered that a wireless gaming mouse was 3,280 yen (including tax) at a Tsukumo net shop sale from the day before.
Since the same price was found at the storefront, the possibility of price misconception was considered and the page of the wireless version was also confirmed to be 5,071 yen (Link to Unicorn). Therefore, there was no misconception of price when ordering.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipping mail also arrived.
The name "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless" can be found in my purchase history for both my email and my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order until the shipment of the wireless mouse that was ordered, I thought it would arrive at that time.
From here it became a problem, and after delivery it took several hours for the message "There was an error in product registration" to come.
That is what the email said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but in reality it was the wired version.
Since we are already shipping wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.

Even though it was the second time in a row that the town was isolated due to a typhoon and heavy rain, the only bridge leading to the town was flooded out by the disaster. The residents had to stock up on food supplies three times as much. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa Village, Furukawa District, Fukushima Prefecture.
The great impact of the typhoon in 2019 was felt even by 8 people in a single room.
Mr. Matsumoto was feeling a bit nostalgic. He said, "It all started with a feeling of'majik'."
It was a terrible feeling when I saw the only path connecting the highland region with the outside world, the Highland Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the local community were left stranded in a desperate situation.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the barrier of the JR railway bridge continued to carry necessary supplies using the bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "If you go to the temple, a car will come to take you to the cemetery. If you don't have a car, you can take a bus or walk across the bridge. It's better to take your time and enjoy the scenery than rush. The sudden bridge was completed three months after the flood. It was destroyed by a typhoon after only a few days of use."
Despite having recovered for two years since the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing his lessons to pass on his experiences.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about buying 10 cases of beer.
We should ensure that food such as canned goods, instant noodles, and cup ramen can be used for emergency food. To this end, we have increased the stock of emergency food by about three times compared to before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto: "Even though it wasn't my own disaster, I couldn't help but feel helpless since I didn't know how much preparation was needed. But I think it's important to take small steps and help each other out in times of crisis." Meanwhile, Shimizu experienced the unexpected disaster firsthand.
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to devise its own unique curriculum from that year onwards.
The town of Shirakawa is going to hold an event called "Disaster Prevention Day" on October 12th in the future. We would like to consider what kind of preparations we can make for disaster prevention on that day.
Even though we have experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.

When buying a used house, beware!
The hole caused by the collapse of the building inspection system (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
Towards Activating the Used Housing Market: The Building Condition Survey System Established. Used housing transactions have been going smoothly.
The price of real estate has been increasing, as has the price of renovation. The renovation market has also been expanding.
As the demand for inexpensive real estate increases, the popularity of words such as "station", "near station", and "direct connection" is rising, leading to a surge in construction of tower-like buildings. This has had a significant impact on the decrease in the number of affordable new constructions.
Although existing (used) housing share in Japan is still low compared to overseas, it is gradually increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started an inspection of building conditions in 2018, with the aim of ensuring safe and secure used homes for trading (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a builder who has become skilled in residential construction checks the current situation and condition of the building, including deterioration, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers when it comes to import and export inspe Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalA new public artwork has been unveiled at Antrim Area Hospital.The artwork, which is located in the hospital’s main entrance, was created by local artist, David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture made from steel and aluminium and is inspired by the hospital’s history and the surrounding landscape.The artwork was commissioned by the Health and Social Care Board as part of its Public Art Programme.The unveiling of the artwork was attended by the Chair of the Health and Social Care Board, Richard Pengelly, and the Chief Executive of the Health and Social Care Trust, John Compton.The Chair of the Health and Social Care Board, Richard Pengelly, said: “I am delighted to be here today to unveil this wonderful artwork.

By conducting a property inspection before engaging in the purchase and sale transaction, the broker can avoid the cost of cleaning and provide the buyer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been increasing in the workplace.
Even if you are on the buying side, you can grasp the condition of used houses for purchase, and it is a system that can be beneficially purchased if you can see it.
On the system of real estate, the principal is usually the seller.
It is also important to pay attention to the fact that the system of inspection has become obligatory at the point of adding and subtracting.
Real estate agents who take on property business are expected to be able to introduce a construction engineer to check the building condition when needed. However, the actual implementation of this duty is not yet obligatory.
Although there is a risk of being anxious in the inspection of the sales of used cars in Japan, overseas markets such as America and the UK have already established similar systems.
Before entering the negotiation stage of buying or selling a house, the buyer will ask for a specialist such as an inspector or building surveyor to inspect the building.
Inspections of used houses are usually conducted at a rate of 70 to 90% in the United States.
In terms of the point that "the buyer" is leading the inspection, the main difference between the Japanese-style inspection and its nature is great.
The seller side can often be seen to be slightly negotiating the condition of the building, up to the limit of their ability, and quickly selling it.
The buyer's side is considering the survey contents and taking appropriate measures to make the house comfortable and safe.
Even if they both share the same goal and purpose, their feelings for each other may still get in the way.
For this reason, the institution of Japan is pointed out as a risk in the following points.
The scope of inspection of the sales model determined by the country shall not be minimized.
Since detailed survey is not done, there is a risk of missing important defects. ● For inspection company, introducing customer cases to the sales company (selling agent) is important.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the seller fails to report unfavorable survey results or shows "ingratitude".

The Ginza, which is known as a fashionable shopping district in Tokyo, was originally a silver coin mint in 1612 (Kan'ei 17). It was moved to present-day Tokyo in 1868.
At that time, it was referred to as "New Exchange Town", but it was later renamed "Ginza" and became widely known by that name.
According to legend, the Tokyo Skytree was once a small island that emerged from the sea near the Ginza district.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed through the marshes of Kameido and the inner moat of the Imperial Palace. From the Japan Bridge to the Ginza, a half-island called "Edojima" extended along the river.
The leading edge of that island is currently located in Tokyo.
The Tokugawa shogunate constructed the Edo Castle and buried the moat, thus proceeding with the improvement of the Kyobashi district.
We must further improve the living environment and develop the water transportation industry by widening canals and rivers.
Thus, they dug up the earth and buried the riverbed of the Kanda Mountain, and thus it became a moat.

The "Torii Shrine" is located in the entrance of the Success Shrine Building 1F, and it is a non-public shrine other than the time of visiting the Hachiman Shrine.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian deities as well as the gods of the land and sea. However, most shrines only worship the gods of rice and harvest.
The shrine in front of the Shinto shrine, "Inari Shrine" which is often visited by foxes, is built in a place where there are many farmers, and it is believed to bring good fortune for the farmers.

Posco International has acquired a majority stake in the Senex Energy Group, a leading Australian gas producer, and is looking to expand its overseas business.
Posco International announced on November 12th that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, as well as a investment agreement with Senex Energy.
Since there are still some procedures, such as the approval of the local NGOs, to be completed at the Senegal Enagie's shareholders' meeting, the acquisition process is expected to be completed in March 2021.
In 2010, the acquisition of Posco by Posco Group became the world's largest M&A (merger and acquisition) case in the history of purchase and merger.
The total amount of purchase and sale was 7709 billion yen, with Posco International investing 50.1%, and Hancock Natural Resources investing 49.9%.
Posco International has been increasing its demand for natural gas continuously in the energy transition era, and has been playing a leading role in the development of the blue hydrogen market by introducing green hydrogen together with natural gas.
Posco International will secure 802Bcf of natural gas storage and 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in Korea through this purchase. It will also secure human resources for land-based gas field operations in the area.

That pain in your knee, could it be "Chondromalacia Patellae"?
Different Treatment Methods According to Cause - Yahoo! News
The Editing Department: Recently, the pain in my knee has been persisting.
Is there a possibility of getting such an illness?
Professor Maruyama: The cause of pain in the knee joint can be varied, such as patellar tendinitis, joint inflammation, and iliotibial band syndrome.
In Japan, "Skeletal Dysplasia" is very common.
Is it possible for body parts to change shape due to editing?
Maruyama-sensei: That's right.
Our original purpose is to cover the surface of the joints with soft tissues in order to absorb shock and to make the movements of the joints smoothly.
As people age, they may experience joint pain due to factors such as weight gain, lack of exercise, and soft tissue weakness.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Is the joint contracture disease also found outside the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Okay.
Even outside the knee, there are joints and tendons in the fingers, toes, head, chest, abd # 2018–19 FC Barcelona seasonThe 2018–19 FC Barcelona season was the club's 119th season in existence and the 87th season in the top flight of Spanish football.

The most common case of this is a foot or ankle sprain, which is called "ankle sprain".
What is the structure of the editing team?
Professor Maruyama said, "The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are irregularly arranged."
Therefore, the part that is covered by this 2-layered structure is the joint cartilage, and the surrounding area is covered by the joint capsule.
The Editing Team: It's Complicated, So We Need a Structure.
Maruyama-sensei: That's great.
There is a layer of smooth tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule, which creates synovial fluid to lubricate the joint.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and condroilin sulfate.
It is said that "Hyaluronic acid and Condroitin sulfate are good for smoothly moving the knee".
What kind of symptoms can occur if you have a deformity of the joints?
Professor Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of viscoelasticity, so it can act as a shock absorber to prevent direct contact between bones.
Iwaba is a role like a maid in a cafe.
If you continue to strain yourself, it can cause joint deformity, inflammation, and pain.
Should I sleep in a pajama?
Basic pyjamas are okay, but when it's time to wash them, it's better to wear a nightgown instead!

Take a step towards the New Year, and generously give a push to the Tori-no-Otoshi at the Shinto shrine in Yasnaga.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Shinto shrine in Yamagata City, where a giant ema featuring the character "tora" (meaning "lion") from the Chinese zodiac has appeared.
The students of Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed a shrine, visited the shrine on November 11th and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The Shinto shrine has been requesting students from the art university to create paintings of horses from last year.
Nine people from the Japanese Painting Course taught by Prof. Mitsuomi Takemura participated in the 3-year program at Tsukuba University and one of their works, a painting by Yui Sasaki (22), was selected for employment.
The painting of a horse is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.

Considering holding a workshop for high school students in Tokyo's Yamagyu Ward: Sandej News Digital.
What kind of town was 2030's Yamanouchi?
The student representatives of four high schools in Tominaga City are discussing the idea of continuing to live in Tominaga at a workshop.
As part of our survey and policy proposal for the organization of "Tamano S.D.G.S. Miraluzuki Center", we will summarize the voices of youth in the business.
What is funny in such a situation?
When the student was asked about the quality of the teacher, he answered things like, "When many people are gathered, it will become lively and energetic" or "The teacher will start to drum and the atmosphere will become lively".
The opening ceremony of the first time was held at the National Diet Building on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed various themes such as "an interesting town", "a livable town" and "a town to feel the atmosphere" while moving to the "island" that was decided by the "World Cafe" method.
Each thought was written on a slip of paper and organized by pasting it onto a model-making paper.
A town with many youth is interesting. There are plenty of transportation options such as trains and buses that do not require a reservation.
We have no points of disagreement; let's talk some more.

However, the natural abundance is beautiful," and started talking with the adults. Not only did he become aware of the local issues, but also felt the charm of the place.
The second meeting of the month of December was only for high school students, to organize the contents of the proposal.
We are planning to announce the mayor and education ministers in February 2021.
The mayor of the same-center is talking about "to foster the hometown love among high school students and to make them actively involved in the community through various activities".

You must not forget to take your coat when going out in winter, even if it means carrying your shoes in your pocket.
While adjusting the balance by looking into a mirror, I hear a mysterious voice.
When I thought there might be a store nearby, I looked around and found a new item.
The store of the brand "Cotto" is about 1 meter long, and has a more compact size feeling than the average.
When I first saw it, I wondered if it was possible to shorten it.
When you look at it closely, you can see that it is a piece of cloth that has been carefully cut and sewn into one piece. The whole thing looks like a net.
The ends of the web are open to store.
Even if you don't join hands at the end, you can still tie each other up with a knot.

The documentary on the Beatles at Disneyland is super interesting.
Despite being directed by Peter Jackson, the film was a flop.
There are so many different kinds of feelings that I can get from a single beat of my heart……
Even though the gossip was about to break apart, it was still so dramatic that I couldn't help but listen.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I was able to understand Paul and George's conversations! I was so surprised! Then, I started to talk slowly and carefully, but it was too late. I had already been caught off guard.
It's so irritating when people are arguing and complaining all the time. But then I realized that it's not worth getting frustrated about it. Instead, I just try to stay positive and focus on my work. That way, I can still have a good time with my colleagues. That's why I think it's so great that the office has such a positive atmosphere.
Then, everyone will start to perform in that special atmosphere.
From the phrase "What are you doing?" our conversation has evolved into listening to the song "That's the Way It Is". It's really boring.
It's amazing how quickly you can get the special title Get Buck in this game.
The funny nose singing scene gradually appears in the recording and it's great.
It's amazing how much you can see the process of composition in such a chaotic environment.
Everyone is so excited to be here before the performance even starts. We're all covered in glitter and ready to watch the show!
Although it was only one episode of the three-episode story, it was very impressive. The maximum cause of the disbandment of the group was the environment around them, as seen in Beatles.
Four people started to make a song together. They were so excited and couldn't stop laughing. Then, they decided to look for a place to perform their song. As they were talking, they met a producer and other people who were enthusiastic about their song. They said, "Let's take our song to the world!" and started to promote it.
Since the documentary is about to explain the director's interpretation, it is remarkable that Peter Jackson felt that way……
It seems that Paul is always surrounded by bad people in the movie scenes, so I thought he was the villain.

I feel like I'm always being responsible for something, even though I have plenty of spare time in my heart.
I'll just have to survive this little bit.
I had to change my job from an operational role due to illness, but I was determined to find something related to the hospitality industry. I had thought that if I could do something different from the operational role, it would be more interesting and fulfilling. So, I chose to work in the hospitality industry, and it has been a great experience so far.
I was able to find some things that were helpful despite the difficulty of the situation. I hope to be able to find more things that are useful in the future and make my life more enjoyable.
Contemplating on something can be tiring, so it's best to take a break and let your thoughts wander.

In America, there was a large number of tornadoes, and the cold weather affected by the seasonal change was strong. (Weather News - Yahoo! News)
A typhoon has developed over the American South from the 10th (Friday) night to the 11th (Saturday) day.
As the temperature dropped significantly in the strong cold air that moved southward, the air quality became very unstable, and the clouds developed rapidly.
A warm and muggy air mass from the Southwest has been pouring into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking heat.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature in the forecast for the next 9 days (Tuesday) and 10 days (Friday) is 30°C (86°F) close to.
In a place where the record-breaking warmth had settled, around 5500 meters below, a strong cold air from the south had descended, resulting in an active frontal system with a well-defined warm front and a rapid development of the convective clouds along the front.
It was observed that the dragonfly was hatching in the nearby area.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage decreases significantly during the summer and fall.
The warning issued in one day of winter season reached 150 times nearer than before and was recorded in great amount.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in America has reportedly received over 400 reports of storms and tornadoes in just 10 days (Friday) alone.
According to this, there are two distinct areas, one on the south side of the line from Kansas to Texas, and the other on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In the EF Scale, the strongest storm in the Kanto region reached EF3, with a peak wind speed of 60 m/s.
By investigating the weather in the future, it is possible to determine whether it will be an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the reformed Tsuchiya Scales) is often used to harmonize the conditions of Japanese architecture, such as the scale of the building.
The level of JEF3, a typhoon that is comparable to the one in America, is high enough to cause considerable damage in Japan.

The roar of "the world's greatest sumo wrestler" from beneath the ring has been broadcast live to help him in his quest (Yahoo! News).
With regards to the damage caused by the typhoon in the western and southern parts of the United States, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11th (Japanese time: November 12th), showed a remarkable performance of exorcis...
CNN and other television networks reported it.
Mr. Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the disaster.
Fear of death exceeding 100 people has spread in Japan.
In KenTucky State, where people were affected by the tornado, they had to carry damaged houses and belongings such as furniture and clothes from 10th night to 11th morning. Tornadoes in KenTucky State and other states exceeded 30.
The record of tornadoes causing damage in 1925, such as in Mizoram State, India, is still left. American meteorologist of CNN specializing in weather has estimated the maximum extent of this tornado to be around 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In the wake of the disaster, the factory in Kendatki City, Miyafiield was severely damaged and had to be shut down due to the 24-hour tense situation.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were gone.
In the darkness of the cave, the weight of the woman who couldn't move her legs due to the thickness of the cave wall was felt by the rescue worker, who was searching for her above the cave wall. She was eventually rescued through live broadcasting from her smartphone.
In addition to the female vocalist's plea for help, the sound of weeping and another female vocalist's terrifying wailing were heard in the live broadcast of "Happy Birthday to You".
The convenience store employee, Anbar Brown, who lived in Myfield, was startled by the earthquake warning and hid in the basement of his house with his 5-year-old child. Everything was safe.
There were many people who were examples of mysterious, eerie sounds like a train whistle, but it was even more frightening.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
He continued his selfless charity work without knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Irino, Ibaraki Prefecture, a warehouse of an online shopping mall collapsed, and at least 6 people were confirmed dead.
The train car was severed by the strong impact, and the tracks were blocked by the influence of derailment and overturned vehicles.

It is an old saying that approaches to evaluating star systems are different from each other.
Other countries are arguing to reduce their debts by sending five astronauts to the stars as a basis, while Japan is arguing to increase its debt by sending three astronauts to the stars as a balance.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard time, but four stars become "poor element" and "beautiful star" in different meanings.
If we use the same criteria to judge a product with five stars, then the product can be classified as either "defect-free" or "excellent" depending on its quality. However, if we present the star system without any quality assurance, then the product can be classed as "defective" due to its flaws. Therefore, it is better not to attach any stars to the product.

This place is the only tropical rainforest region in China, and it boasts abundant biodiversity.
Despite that, the economy has been slowing down on that side.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, China was forced to produce rubber due to its shortage of rubber. In order to do so, vast areas of hot and wet rainforests were cleared in the past.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
After that, I was married to the journalist I met here.
Did Mr. Li have an interest in nature conservation before?
Mr. Li is from a tropical rainforest, but he has no interest in the meaning of biodiversity and nature conservation in such places.

Despite the fact that there was not much time to play with the data that had become stable until the end of March, I felt like I had to spend a lot of time to identify the factors causing the CTD by examining the data during the weekends.
Why can't I analyze the log with.NET Script Framework? (It takes a few minutes to understand.) Some errors are left unresolved even after crash logging.
The timing of the main CTD.
* All plug-ins, such as Papyrus and.NET Script Framework, should leave a trace in the log.dll plug-ins.
If an NPC is killed during the accumulation of Essentials, the console will trigger a kill. This can be improved by disabling the Essentials update.  * これについては濡れ衣の可能性あり？
When the camera work for the Kurumu's transformation is off, it can be fixed by changing the setting to off in the.ini file. However, the limit of how many times the transformation can be done is still unknown.

Is there a misconfiguration of armor and body meshes that can cause the actor/NPC to wear the default 2.0 SPID set? The default.ini has a syntax error but the result is intended to be applied to NPCs with the Perk.
At first, I focused on OnHit relationships and movement/combat MODs (DLLs) by soaking my clothes in water and checking the results.
I couldn't find any similar bug reports in English or German, even at the French level.
People who are struggling with similar CTD problems in a Japanese language environment may find it helpful to refer to this as a reminder.

Thinking about the importance of mental health nursing - Today's visiting nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from dual disability, I have been taking long-term care visiting nurses for a long time. However, I am very pleased to have formed a good relationship with the visiting nurse station's nurse (female) who is always kind and professional.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and dressings in the nursing care (such as wound care), it is more important for people with mental health problems to have enjoyable communication, which I found out in today's visit nursing care.
Today, we discussed gender inequality and laughed a lot.
Talking about the sexual desire of men and women, or how she decided to get a divorce, such a topic is interesting to explore in the nursing care.
Although I am wearing a tamagotchi, I am gender-swapping.
When the medical staff of the psychiatric hospital visited the nursing station, there was no one to provide them with any practical assistance. Instead, they were just told, "This is a place where medical care is provided, so you should know what to do."
Although the small visiting caregiver station I am using is managed by the social welfare organization, I am grateful for the kindness of the caregiver who is taking care of me with mental illness. I hope she is a good caregiver like Frank.
You are so beautiful, it's funny.
Both those who have received mental health care and those who are considering it should be supported.
Visiting a psychiatrist is very helpful for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good nursing station for our visit.
Even though I was angry, I decided to cancel the contract from here.

I've been touching the same shopping bags over and over again.
The Japanese technology of Hydrogen Economy and the Chinese 5-year plan of "Slowing Down the Hydrogen Economy Loading Map" (Central China News Japanese Edition).
The Korean government announced the hydrogen economy load map in 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 6000 hydrogen cars and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of water was set to 6,000 yen per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
This year, the target of fuel cell vehicles is 27% of the standard (approximately 1700 units).
The share of the nuclear energy infrastructure in the proliferation of hydrogen stations is 38% (approximately 117 locations). The price of hydrogen per kilowatt is also the same as the time of the announcement and there is no large difference. 8400Won per ton.
It has been found that the load map of the economy of the government is far below the target value.
The All Japan Economy and Labor Confederation (ALEC) released a report titled "The Current Situation and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy" on December 12.
According to reports, the nuclear industry's core components and materials are mainly dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the automotive battery in Japan is Toho (Japan), White Gold Catalyst is Kyocera (Japan), Membrane Film is DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA) etc.
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, are leading the world market for hydrogen technology patents, with an average annual growth rate of 14% since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of Hydrogen Production and Fuel Cells (2014-2020), Korea is the fifth largest in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) currently consists of 6 major countries that control the majority of the world's water element market. In reality, these 6 countries are the lower-tiered competitors.
The patent ranking of China, the United States, Europe, and Japan is as follows.
Since 2017, China has been steadily expanding its lead over the US in terms of economic and military power.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) exceeded China's (4721 cases) 22% standard.
The Japanese government should designate "national strategy technology" as a priority for investment and research and development expenditure tax deduction limits.

The United States has deployed weapons and medicines to Ukraine as part of its training mission there (CNN.co.jp).
The U.S. State Department reported on December 12th that the Bayden President had accepted a plan for humanitarian assistance based on arms embargoes.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million dollars (approximately 68 billion yen) and is being transported to Ukraine. The last equipment item included in the aid is a radar system to identify launch sites for rocket attacks.
According to the Caribbean reports from the Japanese Ministry of Defense, these weapons also included combat vehicles such as the "Javelin" anti-tank missile.
The purpose of Russia's military support to Ukraine is to strengthen its national defense capabilities, including by receiving weapons and equipment to boost its military power along the border.
The U.S. is monitoring the movements of the Russian military and is warning its allies, including Japan, to be cautious. In the event that Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. is preparing a response plan.
The Baiden Great Leader visited Ukraine on September 1, 2020, and acknowledged weapons assistance.

"Underneath it all, what kind of problem is likely to arise due to the process of unification, and where is the simulation taking place?" The chance to make a donation before death has been reduced to three times.
Even if it is not certain, it is the direction of cutting large tax breaks in order to prepare for future taxation.
How will the rules of succession tax and donation tax change specifically?

The team that won 3 matches in a row in the NFL felt various emotions (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News)
This match, the Joneses threw the pass = Payton Rott's pass was only thrown 3 times.
This record has been held by the New York Giants for 47 years since 1974. It was only two times in the past 50 years in the NFL.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, a talented RB who had broken the season record of 2000 yards for the first time in history, played for the Buffalo Bills.
The Bulldogs crushed the Simpson and Blackstone RBs in the 40-yard dash.
The reason for the extreme offensive of the Payton Rottweilers was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains oriented towards the North Pacific Ocean.

The defense before the goal of the last board.
The buildings that were chasing the 4 points became the 3rd & 9th Penalty.
The goal is 18 yards away.
The quarterback was surrounded by the defense's rush at the 3rd&14 and eventually escaped to the right side of the field by throwing the ball from the pocket.
He threw the Endzone's Teddy Bear into the air, but it was a failure.
In this game, the right outer edge was run by WR Stefon Diggs, who had just become free from the Endzone. However, he couldn't get the attention of the referee.
The 4th & 18-yard line, Allen ran out of the left sideline and was chased down by WR Gabrielle Deabis. The pass was tipped by the DB Miles Bryant and fell incomplete, ending in a failed attempt.
Although Brain was covering the WR Cornerback position with his body, he suddenly released the ball and reacted to the pass in the middle of the game.
Allen ended up passing the finish line twice after watching the two rescuers drop their bags.
Although it was difficult to decide the route for the 4th down, there was no need to target the TD for the 3rd down.
If you can achieve a first down in two attempts at the play, it will be worth it.

3 items to make your kitchen more organized in the long run: 1. A timer 2. A replacement for your cutting board 3. A storage container (Harper's BAZAAR)
Sponge
Even if you frequently change the sponge, it will eventually become worn out and will need to be replaced.
Even though kitchen sponges are often used to clean dishes, they can also be a source of bacterial growth if not properly sanitized. Recent research has revealed that bacteria can rapidly multiply in kitchen sponges even when they are exposed to electronic sanitizers.
The German researcher who conducted this study recommended that people should wash their hands with soap for one week to keep them clean.
Wooden plank
The US Department of Agriculture is encouraging people to replace rotten and damaged timber with new lumber.
Whenever a wound or a sore starts to progress, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria start to reproduce due to the lack of hygiene.
If you are still a big man, then you should forget about the table spoon of the liquid disinfectant and dilute the 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water with the fragrance-free liquid detergent.
Submerge a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.
Using a clean paper towel, gently wring out the water from a beautiful, clean cloth.
Dishware, china, breakage
Even though it may be uncomfortable to divide the magical cup of interest, the untouched surface will become a new warm bath for bacteria and fungi.

There are various reasons why people want to live alone. Some people may prefer to live alone because they want to savor the tranquility of a solitary lifestyle, while others may want to avoid the hassle of sharing living space with others. Some people may also want to have more freedom to make their own decisions and to have more privacy. Ultimately, the reasons why people want to live alone are unique to each individual.

After studying the sword of the demon, I have become a warrior.
The exchange of effort is the essence of humanity, as seen in the anime "Ueki no Honoo". (QJWeb Quick Japan Web)
In recent manga, the blade of the Demon Slayer was described as "exotic".
There is no battle in the story, even if it is read during the day or night, and the readers' popularity has become a fixed point.
Even though it took him two years to become a master of the same jump manga "One Piece", he was able to draw only the outline and fill in the rest with a brush of joy.
The mysterious charm of the exotic landscape is one of the attractions of the place. However, there is a tendency that people tend to stay in the same place and not to change it.
After the main character, Ashitaka, completed his training with the sword of the demon slayer, he thanked the brave and loyal San, and offered to help him regain his lost power. San accepted and asked him to help him reclaim his power, saying "It's time to take back what's rightfully ours!"
Weaklings have no rights, no choice, and no power. They can only be oppressed by the strong.
The "thief" who introduced the "demon slayers" near the "Kinshachi" shrine was a brave and generous person (even though it was done in a cowardly manner).
When the first contact between Shiro and Kagami happened, Shiro was told that "If you were to be eaten by a human, what would you do?" and Shiro replied with "It's too late to make a decision now."

Despite the strong smell of the stew, they diligently continued to stir it with their hands, and eventually it became the correct "Prince's Stew".
Even though it was sudden, he was able to avoid the entire thing by using his high physical strength. However, it was only a matter of time before he was defeated by the demon.
Ordinary people suddenly become powerful without knowing the secret of the hidden strength and skill. If they wake up, they can use the power and technique they have developed until now in a natural way.
Those who have put in effort will be rewarded, but those who have not put in effort will receive nothing.

A review of the fourth volume of the manga "Kin-iro Mosaic" (Sunshine Mosaic).
The 20th Superhuman Olympics began in the third volume and has now concluded in the fourth volume!
The first chapter was filled with tension as the sumo wrestlers prepared for the upcoming match.
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review Submitter Name: Oginumama X (Star 5) ●Pro Wrestling Has Already Started Even Before The Match!
This is a four-volume series of stories about a wrestling match between a giant red man and a small blue man wearing a mask. It was drawn in a detailed and orderly manner, so it couldn't have been just a single match. It must have been a series of matches, with each volume focusing on a different match.
From the start of the tournament, we have been challenging each other in the sumo wrestling ring, and also practicing special techniques and creating unique sumo scenes. But even though we have changed a lot, it is not yet time to surrender.
As the tension in the air gradually builds up, the reader can feel the excitement of the upcoming battle in the story. This feeling of anticipation is sure to increase the tension of the reader and make them eager to find out what will happen next.
Thus, the decisive match before the finals of the Teriyaki vs. Ramen Man tournament was held.
While eating gourmet sashimi, my friend suddenly shouted, "From now on, I'll be the boss!" in the backstage of the sumo wrestling arena.
Trying to make a pop sound with a stick.
However, the silent Tamakoma-mura man suddenly stopped the man with the knife and simply stared at him, causing the scene to be completely separated from the others.
This martial arts tournament is amazing, but there's no way I'm going to surrender without a fight.
Despite its miserable life, it still wears a cheerful smile.
If you could see such a future, you wouldn't be able to resist wanting to be a part of it!
It's surprising how much trouble a single character can cause, and now I'm getting a taste of what it's like to be a manga artist!
Although the fight between those two was short and ended without a break, the ring scene was filled with the tears of the loser after the match.
"You must not rely on only your own strength! Believe in the power of the gods!"
That is a lifel.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the work itself, and readers have been gradually understanding it as they go, so there's no need to force it. It's better to just let it flow naturally.
Even though the teacher forbade them to talk about ramen, they still managed to sneak in a few comments.
Readers, can you defeat the powerful wrestler with just your words?
What are you doing? 」
It seems like the teacher is trying to bind the student's imagination with her own creative vision, so that the student can create a work of art.
This is a great surprise.

The FBC (Fuji TV) will be holding a winter illumination event at the Mt. Aoba (Fukui Prefecture) on the last weekend of December.
At the base of the tall mountain in the center of Takahama town, a winter illumination is starting to take shape. The garden is bathed in a beautiful light.
The illumination of winter, which started on November 26th, is a spectacular light show featuring 500,000 LED lights scattered across the 20-meter-high Kusanoke hill and a path of various plants.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture have been coming to Fukui Prefecture for a long time and have been surprised to find such a wonderful place.
You are so beautiful. I was amazed by your beauty.
Illumination is a place to feel relaxed and healed even though it was originally planned for only one day. It will be lit up from 5pm to 8pm on December 25th, 26th, and 27th.
On the 25th day of the year, a Christmas event will be held, along with a dance performance of the Bottonkursu and a movie screening.
People who can read documents in order are limited.
When I heard my friend was able to read a book while using Linux, I was amazed. I had never expected that Linux could be so powerful. So I decided to take a look at the documentation and read it thoroughly.
It is easier to apply abstractions learned from high-level programming languages like Python to Linux than to touch-and-feel the underlying complexity.
I understand everything by pulling it apart piece by piece.
If you understand, it's okay. ‥.
It's okay even if you're not in the right order.

This morning's misfortune has…
The power supply for a NAS-use PC has become inaccessible.
That happened.
Open the window for the sake of the morning air.
This is the time of the power outage.
2.) After a while, the pink rotator sound from the PC started to get on his nerves. So he shut it down immediately.
It is thought that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the temperature drop (6°C).
I tried it one more time even though it was difficult.
3.) No activation.
When you press the power button, the electricity will turn on the light for just a moment, but then it will turn off immediately.
After that, there was only silence.
Try again by unplugging the power plug just for a moment.
Try disconnecting all the parts except the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector and power on.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles Bubbles Bubbles" has been coming from the PSU fans for a long time, but it is not the cause of any problems.
We will try to find an ATX power supply afterward.
Tubun.

The emoji with the highest usage rate is the crying face.
I believe emoticons are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there have been many applications and tools that allow users to express their emotions and feelings through emoticons instead of stamps.
Spicy, simple, no reply needed, polite element.
In the modern communication, the subtle atmosphere is essential to be treasured with pictures!
Everyone is using characters in drawings, don't you think?

Positive and bright visuals are ranking in.
According to the Unicode standard, 92% of the world's net population is using emoticons.
It seems that 5% of all manga characters are used to represent the number one!
Even though emoticons like 😆, 😆, and 😆 are widely used, they are still hard to understand sometimes.
When it's interesting time, happy time will come naturally, right?
Even if you don't have time to think, you should at least be mindful of your emotions in such moments.
People who have never used a top 10 anime character once are rare.
I want to try that style.
