The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's retail price.
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and thus it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction to attach my package so it can be tracked as a return to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs her 179€.
I find it very annoying.
Should I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price or is there another way of getting a refund?
I think it is generally unacceptable to expect children to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
Nevertheless, I think it is also good for big brothers and sisters to help out with the little ones in moderation.
Look quickly, help quickly, bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they are still able to be children, I do not see any problem.
If your K1 is occupied with something for a short time and it's OK for him, then that's good.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and spend hours accompanying him in sleep.
It is likely to be right legally.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist said this.
If something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to handle.
Whether it is a risk that you want to take is of course your own judgement ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer?
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by stuffing himself with food and going into the enclosure with his pet cats.
The case is taken over by a commissar who, after a short investigation, is led to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissar has a small niece who also has an anxiety (of fire) and lands at this therapist.
It leads to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired to be present at the scene of the suicide and to document it and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center and the patients ultimately succumb to their fear to the most extreme degree.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death intentionally)
This will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the hospital that had caught on fire.
That is the rough action I am sure that the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this action is known to someone or if someone were to tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I have to contact my husband first.
That could take some time.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?

Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work out and it hurt.
When we try to get it to react, it responds hysterically.
No chance anymore.

Due to the outbreak of Omikron: Johnson will push for a vaccination campaign.
Politics and science in Britain are constantly dealing with new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all adults in England who are eligible for vaccination should receive an offer of the vaccine by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will accelerate the pace of the Corona vaccine booster shots in light of the rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have already had the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their last vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
The target date was originally set for the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish regions can be accelerated.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation in regards to the Omikron variant, therefore we must strengthen our vaccination efforts immediately.
The good news is that the immunization level can be raised again with a third dose.
"Let's get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of the Omikron virus were registered in Great Britain, thus increasing the total number to 3137.
In comparison to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor of people using pronouns.
I have sent in a job application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation was sent via email.
I will reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated one.
I have googled him/her and depending on where they have a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the e-mail.
Can someone help me?
I am a foreigner and I will not stoop to treating any officials with disrespect.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books in total.
4 of them are going.
The one thing I bought today is not working.
It was obvious that the chair had a hidden defect when it was sold.

It has been working since approximately.
14 days not anymore.
Therefore, I always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was none left.
They are now available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and have it billed to me.
The feeling of helplessness.
Warning: I will be writing something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I have to write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence due to my profession.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims are not able to help themselves or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it will not be perfect.
However, there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in conversation with four people, with the perpetrator far beyond the range of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply endure violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will never get lighter by doing this.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
What does the series "Arcane" on Netflix have to do with "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Ludwigsburg's Derby Debacle at Crailsheim's Merlins
At least on young John Patrick was left.
Nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said that the team still had "something in their bellies" after their cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim.
She then didn't lay down - but instead further increased her performance despite the 61:72 (28:38) - loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the bare result was disappointing.
This will be represented by a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The trier rate was 13%, 4 goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) at the same time, 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick's response was: "We were simply not focused enough after our victory at Teneriffa and were not able to implement what we had trained for."
Thus moving the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "It was great to win the game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like there were 10,000 people there.
Only 750 people were allowed to attend the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they still had to pay for it.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided his team to victory.
"The best game manager I ever trained", praised Gleim still.
While in Patrick's team even the performance leaders like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) on the whole failed.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) were the giants able to prevent a total disaster and came within eight points of their opponents, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is little time for arguing.
The Riesen will already be receiving the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:19 PM) at the Ludwigsburg arena, where up to 750 spectators will be able to watch.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have re-sent them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always like a song out of an egg: Max Raabe will be 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with fresh interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is traveling with the program "Good Day, Lucky Star" - if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig.
Nevertheless, nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "due to governmental instructions", in order to prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading.
Other performances of his in the Advent season have had to be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 years old, and his band (www.palast-orchester.de).
The artists will then try to catch up on their 2020 cancelled performances due to the pandemic in January.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of popular songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the same success as his hit album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) by coming in at number two in the charts.
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene is impossible to ignore.
With the program "Good Day, Lucky Star" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we can check beforehand whether it matches the color scheme.
It still doesn't work. I can only long for the cover page but not to turn the pages.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Through Enteignment, No New Housing is Created
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large residential real estate companies, as it has been demanded in the Berlin People's Referendum.
"With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes", said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is in fact the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
When the situation did not calm down, Geywitz was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent ceiling until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental market.
I will be speaking with the Justice Minister to get it done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite all efforts, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and it has just occurred to me that I have forgotten the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again?
Will it ever come back?

Discount sounds great.
Then I would uncheck it at the new order.
Thank you for the quick resolution!

At least 100 people were killed by tornados in Kentucky.
Several tornadoes have ravaged the United States as part of a devastating storm system.
It is estimated that more than 100 people could have died in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several Tornados caused severe destruction in the USA and might have claimed up to hundred casualties.
The storms have left a roughly 320-kilometer-long path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, "Everywhere the tornado went, everything was gone."
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is impossible to imagine that it is possible.
He is counting alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That is very sad.
Is it still produced?
Is she completely out of the product line?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you have to sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the roof now and deliver it to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned the contact form or had given up on it and wanted to inquire whether it had arrived or been processed, since I had not received any confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccine premiums and changing their advertising slogans.
While the German government is rejecting proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money rewards for getting vaccinated.
By doing so, they are on the same page as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination today.
Even the transformation of advertising slogans into "Stay safe - get vaccinated" - in the German style - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has changed jobs over which he has complained.
It doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year.
He had clearly not been attached to his old job and had been looking for something else.
You can do it, too.
And that he didn't like you then: no big deal.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
This will then become legally relevant.
I am finishing a screen shot.

The new coffee machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee straight to your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the painted plastic surface in muted colors combined with the brushed stainless steel front make the new SMEG Coffee Vollautomat with Milk Frother an object of design.
The reduced design allows for all functions such as grind setting and water quantity, as well as the choice between espresso, americano, ristretto or a mild coffee to be selected with only four buttons.
Thanks to the steam plant, one can also prepare coffee-milk and milkshake specialities.
Help with first own campaign.
Wow!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on the adventure Over the Greifenpass and want to seamlessly transition them into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are devised and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
The further action will take place there.
The hero should be lured into a trap a few miles away from the village by a group of Goblins.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to mind.
Group Strength: 8 normal Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords equipped.
If the hero is not noticed, the Goblins are lurking in a side alley and attacking with three bows on the left and right flank of the wagon, while two of them are trying to stop the wagon with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes surrender, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes were all rendered unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
If a defeat was unavoidable, this half-elf would join the fight with two of his men and help the heroes in their battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How did you apply Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure to start with?
The Goblins will play an important role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send her back.
Can you then come back with the receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I am frustrated with Sky Sports F1.
Hello lovely F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been steadily declining over the season, so I thought I'd take a break with this post.
First, the F2 race was interrupted midway through to begin the F1 coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the crash had caused the time plan to be far behind the original plan, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It appears that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and must therefore restrict itself to a certain extent, so that Sky DE had no choice but to make this compromise.
Despite being dumb, Sky UK has decided to end the race early.
Despite a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was yet another rules miscommunication between commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they both didn't know that one has to change the tires under a red flag.
Although there had been this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both decided to let Verstappen change his tyres only after Hamilton had sent out the corresponding radio messages.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this opportunity was available for Verstappen.
I believe one should be familiar with such basic rules, if one is commentating on a Pay-TV F1 race.
It is not the first time a puzzle-solving game has been played, where the rules may be either allowed or prescribed, both of which always bring about constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, Roos doesn't like the artificial style of commenting, but it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness, which both look unprofessional, as ordering coffee with the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" of Ralf Schumacher.
The last one is causing a lot of commotion in the comments, which he clearly doesn't take seriously.
Not least, advertising has taken over completely at Sky, in the last round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, so one can only listen to the German audio without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing it.
These two channels do less advertising than Sky, and they are free-TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, it does not completely erase the drawbacks.
The rest of the programming on Sky Sports F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language channel that broadcasts the F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, ironically.
Therefore, the amazing F1 season makes much less fun than it could be with a reasonable TV channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the #PRS_ORG# Pendelleuchte, there is a metal frame and multi-colored glass.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send the email and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already displayed a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
I would like support.
Air pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using a fan.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can compare the performances here.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate an entire facility?
If one has a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable, so that one can connect more than one outlet.
The MK-Series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, you can also use a pump to create an accent in the aquarium, such as with a air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decoration, which transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to call.
The MK-Series has a special, sound-dampened construction, resulting in low operational noises.
The installation is very easy.
The fan is connected to the air duct by a flexible air hose 4/6 mm in diameter...and it's ready to go.
The fan should be level, or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the water level is lower than the pump suction, a check valve should be placed between the pump and the discharge line.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the ventilator between the two ends.
This would prevent it from happening if water were to run backwards through the pump, draining the basin...
If the fan should be placed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture in the same way as other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages, consuming little energy.
Even though we have indicated a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, the items are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to take precautions so that no one is upset because it took a little longer than expected.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for the whole staff, which also works in the transportation...of course, here no one is affected by the Corona virus.
Please don't rate the service immediately bad just because the delivery has been delayed, it is entirely the fault of the delivery services.
People like to complain about these services, even though we are saying...they have it really hard.
This is also very regional.
Be kind to no one, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times ahead.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is sending his astronaut daughter and TV host brother into space.
The daughter of the first US astronaut in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short space flight.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, wearing a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space flight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much each of them paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back to the stars again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness, before it was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no universally accepted definition.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Audrey Powers.
Critics are accusing Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the space tourism industry largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or is studying biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting and engaging. I also find the laboratory work to be quite enjoyable (I have already completed my organic chemistry laboratory practical).
I had already inform myself about the job prospects before studying, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely keep studying until the PhD.
I am currently dealing with doubts, especially the job prospects are worrying me.
On one side (Studycheck etc) one always hears about amazing job opportunities and the profession is highly sought after, on the other side one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
That would really interest me:
What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What have you studied/ What kind of education have you made?
Would you do it again?
Many thanks for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering either quitting my studies and pursuing an apprenticeship as a software engineer.
If you have any experiences, please write them down.
Extra Stress for Holidays and Weekend

It was actually like this: Last week was Mary's Ascension, which is called "Ascension Day" here in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses take a semi-official day off on Fridays.
Last weekend, there was a long four-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
There were a lot of emails that had to be sent before the weekend, tasks here and there, everything had to be done before the long weekend.
Why... why?
Why does it sound like it's taking so long when it's not?
Why do people want to accomplish so much in a short week as if it were a normal week?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.

Why do we still need holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above; the colleagues were all quite independent in how they handled it.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?

DDR-Handwork Model E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the loco was in Saxony and Central Germany in service, the very rare loco probably comes from the conversion proposal of the modeler ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the schlesian network, possibly comes from the small series firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being restored to operational condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2.200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to procure the locomotive as a 1’Co+Co1’ type with Tatzlager-drive from AEG for the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were assigned the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and eventually found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the readiness for overhaul of all six locomotives was established.
As the need for electric locomotives for heavy freight traffic increased with the progress of electrification in the middle of Germany, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the available E 04, E 44, and E 94 were preferred for construction in larger quantities.
It was only when it became clear that the processing number could not be increased any further that the E 95 came into focus.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They arrived at the railway workshop Halle P. in 1960.
They were usually hauled by coal trains from the Geiseltal to destinations such as Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
It proved to be increasingly difficult to control the locomotives as they aged.
It often happened that Shooter got stuck while doing maintenance tasks.
The fireman, who had to ride the engine constantly, had to uncouple the shutter during the journey using a hammer and a wooden wedge.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and resulted in months-long failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new build electric locomotives available and no plans for an expansion of the electric network, so the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the splinter gauges, thus retiring the E 95.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to only have one-man crews for their electric locomotives, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on October 5th, 1970.
The intended new name 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives, except for E95 02, were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating device on the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it in a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] She had belonged since then to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) is responsible for maintaining the locomotive in a museum setting.
Since 1995 employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint job, with the transformers checked and five traction motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their robust design and minimal maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to become part of the Mitteldeutsche Netze.
The main deployment area was initially Schlesien.
This is an OVP handcrafted model H0 in good condition. It needs some optical refinements to the locomotive in the form of sanding, dusting and a slight odor of cement. It is a very rare handcrafted model, and it is possible that the kit came from the small-run company Zschützke and Bachmann.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.

I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle balken is held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the balken cannot be mounted on the feet.

The middle balken is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately defective.
The middle bracket does not fit into the designed holder.

When will they be sent off?

To Strengthen Trust in Vaccines - Biontech CEO Publishes Immunization Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur published a photo of himself getting his Corona vaccination.
His friend's illness prompted him to share, according to Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a picture showing him getting a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information circulating in the social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the social network "LinkedIn".
"My friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it, as the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a breathing machine for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He had not asked for the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by false information and mistrust.
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Uğur Şahin has been circulating on the Internet in which he says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," said Şahin then.
In Germany, there is a priority for vaccination.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been long since lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in Transformer Station: Ten Thousand People Without Power
In several cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had rendered a power substation inoperable.
After a fire with severe damage to an electrical substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to without power for 24 hours.
Thousands of people had their lights go out on Friday evening due to a fire that affected 41,000 people in several communities.
Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators had been in operation until the widespread disturbance was finally brought to a halt late Saturday evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW rendered assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered places of refuge in schools and called for neighborly help.
The provider thanked the affected individuals for their patience and thanked the helpers for their effort.
We are aware that the last 24 hours have brought about significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their untiring effort", said the head of the Primary Technology area, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take some more days, since the Westnetz-Monteure had to firstly put some of the cables provisionally back in operation, as he explained.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company's statements.
The current is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 PM local time in the Westnetz Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation has been reported to have severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
There are costly cleaning and repair works necessary there.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday at 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on at 21.30.
Since 11:55 PM, even the last ones still affected by the power outage got their electricity back.
Over 80 workers from Westnetz and its partner companies were involved.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important now that the citizens look after their elderly or isolated neighbors and inform the local fire stations if help is needed, as explained by Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power supplies, the elderly residents of nursing homes were particularly in focus.
In addition, according to government reports, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical supervision.

In order to achieve a even and clean paint job, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and let dry.
Before you paint the brush with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the later not visible inner side of the parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component.
Draw even lines side by side with the brush.
A light overlap of the color layers ensures even coverage later on.
Avoid quick, back and forth brushstrokes with the brush.
This leads to unrealistic surface appearances.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise appear later.
Metallic tones and colors are finished off with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal flakes when they are mixed with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry overnight before sanding them.
The models can achieve an original look by using decals or stickers.
From airplane insignia to ship names to decorations on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order, as long as the parts are still easy to reach.
A cockpit can be fitted or beefed up before it is inserted into the body of the plane.
More important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers and needle are when gluing patience, time and a steady hand.
Cut each needed Decal out individually and place them correctly.
Decals are also known as water-sliding pictures, because you can make their back side wet by lightly sprinkling it with water, until the paper absorbs the moisture and turns dark.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also wet before).
While you are holding the decal in place with a tool, you are gently pulling the carrier paper away from the model.
Attention: Always check to make sure the picture is securely in place before you completely remove it from the paper, to prevent it from sticking to your finger, knitting or tearing.
Extra water can be absorbed with a housewife's cloth.
This product is not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else, I have to log out and log in again and find the place I stopped reading.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Is this also for all 3 packages?
For the lamp came to me in 3 separate packages.
Even though, thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.

Treatment for PKV / What is a "Claims Case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in the child welfare treatment for a while, now that it's about the billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands this.
In order:
We had applied for the IVF treatment in advance with the PKV and got the approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, which was then accounted for with the PKV.
Several months later, we tried to have a second child, and underwent 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet include the cost of these in the budget.
We applied again for cost coverage from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we had more trials than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 trials.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second child wish shall be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right to pay for the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that a birth would have caused the experiments to fail?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (resulting from blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thanks a lot for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants per email and tell me how I can reach them best again?
Everything is in order.
We will not order anything else from them.
When they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address) together, they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass it on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me to send it back.
I can't do anything about it if the chest of drawers shows up completely destroyed at my place.
Can you please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot?
It is clear and evident that the repayment was triggered and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two of your most important customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do this anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after several months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal usage.
They are not allowed to sell him as a office chair.
Regardless of that, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to get another type of packaging.

Top Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of lists of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com.

Hello
A half-victory against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU.
According to Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs were however high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the conflict in a sustainable manner, according to a researcher at the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably still go on for a while.
The way people are treated at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong.
It appears that there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by certain EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not take a decisive stance against it, it will come at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens simultaneously the unity within the Union.
She apparently cannot prevail if a member state decides to go its own way, as is the case with Poland, which even refuses the EU border security agency Frontex access to its border.
In addition to paying for its policy on the border with Belarus, the EU has had to pay another price, according to Bossong: It has become more difficult to reach an agreement on the asylum policy, as the line "border security, border security, border security" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again.
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to illegally enter Poland from Belarus.
55 migrants were apprehended and brought back to the border overnight, according to a spokesperson on Sunday.
The Polish officers were attacked with stones near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Security recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border fences by the time on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukashenko of being a dictator in Minsk, luring him with the prospect of visa-free travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened to suspend the operating licenses of airlines that transport migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its power in the marketplace into the scales and has demonstrated its resolve to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian government is not likely to be pleased with the security apparatus regularly rounding up thousands of people and sending them through the country.
Mercedes has protested the controversial Formula 1 season finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
It is suspected that two rule violations occurred in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is directed against Max Verstappen for allegedly breaching the rules of Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he was supposedly overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the final result of the race.
According to Mercedes's view, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-compliant manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was performed shortly after the conclusion of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had passed several cars ahead of him.
I am checking it.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park is hosting a SC Freiburg fan event.
The Europa-Park, the naming rights holder for the Europa-Park Stadium of SC Freiburg, has invited fans to join the Fantag event.
Those who had a membership card or a season pass from the Sport-Club in the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
There were also coupons for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars glowed that day due to the T-shirts being red and white.
Fox, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons created the perfect setting", so the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a collaboration between the Bundesliga team and the recreation park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag event in the Europa-Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Watching the shining fans having fun in the roller coaster, confirms what Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack says: "It's great fun!"
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€?
Stages in the career of the new World Champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new world champion of Formula 1.
Max Verstappen did it.
The Dutchman claimed his first World Championship title in his seventh year in Formula 1 with Red Bull.
His Way to the Top of the King's Class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the Karting World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen lets him stand angrily at a gas station on the way back.
His mother Sophie Kumpen is collecting the teenager in the car that is following her.
2014, England: The junior team of Red Bull receives a promising new recruit in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old is following in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
He was continuing to race in the European Formula 3 at that time.
2015, Australia: Verstappen starts at the age of 17 and 166 days, making him the youngest driver in history to compete in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he has to prematurely retire his Toro Rosso in Melbourne.
In 2015, Malaysia: The then Toro Rosso driver Verstappen is 17 years old and 180 days, becoming the youngest driver to ever obtain points in the Formula 1.
Verstappen finishes seventh in Sepang at the Malaysian Grand Prix.
2016, Spain: In his first race appearance for Red Bull, Verstappen wins immediately.
At 18 years and 228 days, he will become the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his first pole position in Budapest - he is not the youngest anymore.
At 21 years old, he is leaving Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
Verstappen celebrates with 24 years at the Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi his first world title - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final lap.

Sorry but only because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean anything.
That is like when an anti-Semite says he has nothing against foreigners.
They will not admit it to both.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of antisemitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself then one should just leave it completely.
Yeah, you're about as serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question the fundamentals of evolution are completely lost.
In any case, a god has set it in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
With that you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal viewing field, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic and achromatic lens system allows you to use the Lupe practically error- and color-free even in the edge area.
Loupes are often marked with magnification ratings.
These conditions apply only to exact specified conditions that rarely match the user's conditions.
In order to use your Lupe optimally, please take note of the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see the user manual in the packaging).
On the surfaces of all optical devices - even in impact loupes - light reflections are created.
By using an antireflection coating, these reflections can be significantly reduced.
When used according to the optimal usage conditions - look closely at the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
You will find further information in the accompanying user manual (available in both German and English).

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: In the village of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even had to return home alone because he couldn't agree with his partner.
He plants there about 2000 trees every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says the holiday season always makes things a bit more fun.
What about the coupon?
Why am I not a customer anymore?!
Although I received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price for it, I am still satisfied.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better one, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat which is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from tasty.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having difficulty setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly, receiving and sending 50 Mbit without any issues.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also come.
However, at the other end of the hallway, there is a WiFi module which is not sending out the full 500 anymore, but instead, the further I move away from the module, the lesser it is (so I use a power outlet which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was better than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Could someone explain why so much Internet speed is lost over the power line with glass fiber?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install a LAN cable in that house.
I am really at the point of giving up, so I created this extra account for myself.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch the Giro account.
No one would have thought that there would be peace at the Giro accounts now, but it seems that this is not the case.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases, negative interest rates have further eroded customers' savings.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 Euros.
She has now halved her bonus and even quartered her daily allowance.
In the first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the Postbank branch - to 50,000 Euros for Giro and investment accounts, and to 25,000 Euros for current accounts.
However, these lower freeboard levels now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson upon request.
This applies not only to new contracts, but also to "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 Euros, which is still in effect, as well as for the ING Germany.
The popular cost-conscious customer bank DKB has reduced its free withdrawal limits in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
At least 100 banks have, according to the Internet portal Verivox, already granted a free credit limit of 25,000 euros or less.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached the 25,000 Euro mark: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there between the consumer centers, which have won the first instance court case against this regulation in Berlin.
Now banks are discussing whether they should set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and have to repay millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty team working for her.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Your life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who in 2021 caused a stir with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is mainly the result of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers are dedicated to perfecting her appearance.
At least, as Aniston, she'll allow herself one chip per day (yes, that's right: one single chip from the bag).
That you were able to capture the hearts of both female and male fans at the same time is truly a miracle.
Maybe because she has bad luck with the good things in life - and still searches for the great love.
He has removed the baby wish from the list.
Before she was always asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked me didn't have any idea what was wrong with me medically, why I couldn't.
It was really hurtful.
Hope remains that even success and fame will bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Räikkönens farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn unzipped his sweatshirt and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light tire rub, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after just half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also gone to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and was on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I have calculated it, I need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he initially fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, by moving up from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material settings and drove on Sunday with 0.30 seconds a larger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also notched his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, came in second this time around and placed fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in fourth place in the first race and ended up in eighth place.
"If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte brought home the third season win in the two-woman bob on the home track.
After coming fourth the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory with Anschieberin Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Mariama Jamanka, the two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion from BRC Thüringen, came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded her Olympic qualification as well as her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is going to take me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot of work to be done elsewhere".
Jamanka was a bit frustrated by the not entirely error-free journeys, but she said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had already put the blanket in my shopping cart and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't cash it in, so I finally asked.
Through Corona, I had different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had run out which made me very angry.
They were discussing the Ashley seat in the chat.
I would like to return it and then place another order, since it is currently reduced :)
Why is the shipping not starting until 16.3.?
Nothing was mentioned on your website about long delivery times.
No, not until I tap the field comes an extra field with the message.
Your colleague took it away from you yesterday.
Why is it a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
However, we would still like to buy the dresser module, even a new undamaged one.
Don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have a few things I want to write down and maybe it will help the one - or the other...
I am 24, have a part-time job, am a student and a dogmama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to the kindergarten, he is pretty much 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, has gotten a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him and we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand was in a bandage due to burns).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week), which is bothering me a lot with regards to my needs for affection and love.
My dog is feeling sick, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I gave him some warmth and cuddles.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which we will divide among us.
But cooking is too much work for me...
My PTBS (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) illness is currently doing very well, I am halfway through my therapy and am managing to cope.
Not good, but I'm managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university is requiring a lot (for me), tomorrow I have a written test for which I have not prepared anything, and the next day I need to prepare for an Anatomy lecture.
Next week I have a written exam on Tuesday, and then who knows what comes next. It's all written down in my calendar, not in my head because there's no room for it.
My week is going like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then what happens?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the summer holid Home » News » News » 2018 » The Future of Transportation is ElectricThe Future of Transportation is ElectricThe future of transportation is electric. Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their lower emissions, lower fuel costs, and quieter operation. EVs are also becoming more affordable and are now available in a variety of sizes and styles.The City of St. Louis is committed to promoting electric transportation and has installed electric vehicle charging stations at several locations throughout the city. These charging stations are available for public use and are a great way to reduce emissions and save money on fuel costs.The City of St. Louis is also working to increase public awareness of electric transportation and its benefits. The city has partnered with the Missouri Electric Vehicle Initiative (MEVI) to provide educational resources and outreach activities. MEVI also provides resources for businesses and organizations that are interested in installing electric vehicle charging stations.For more information about electric transportation and the City of St. Louis’ efforts to promote it, visit stlcity.com/electrictransportation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am simply too stressed out to have any mental clarity, so I need these mental anchors to keep me grounded. Otherwise, I will just pack my bags and leave.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't seem to do it any other way...
Does it also go for you?
I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
I am truly infinite in my gratitude; I can hardly express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams otherwise.
I think it has something to do with the mental load that women often carry and that's why I thought I could find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all an enjoyable evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately it was the wrong color and texture plus the table top had a scratch mark.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
When we will exchange the table, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on #DATE#.
In addition, two times.
She was not confirmed.
Nothing was the same: I found out in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like Math or Geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe even because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you stand it?
You could also tell stories from your colleagues about their different attitudes towards work and study.
I generally understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the Theory of Relativity.
Why would anyone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I would like to write in English as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would abandon it.
It's good, thanks.
I am expecting a response within the next few days, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help please
Hello lovely people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the Modern (real) World.
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (resembling those from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead, who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to live forever.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
I believe they are fighting each other at the end.
If this message means something to you, I am grateful for every response.
Our Little One has only slept on her stomach since Week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, more often go in and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Although we had no sleeping bag, we always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it get something from the stomach?
Is it lying face first directly in the mattress?
You can draw from this to determine whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was a big change and a joy to be able to put the kids on their bellies to sleep.
In addition, we are already "loyal customers" at your store and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have received no reply.
It's about my dresser, which arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the chest.
I would very much appreciate it if you could contact me as soon as possible.
The chest is not currently available for use.
To make it completely clear.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I had fun with RBTV too.
It's simply that the politics of this sender have gone underground.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno said: "One did not want to be a running billboard."
What are we now?
A 0815 advertising sender, who tries to sell his billboard merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They can obviously continue to insult the people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy and is trying to pass off the exploded rental rooms as ashes.
How should one find all of that?
It's great when it suits you, I find it awful.
I would like to return the product, as it has arrived defective.
Breach of corpus through damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped being charged through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power supply alone would be enough to operate.
Battery alert, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with a plugged in power adapter.
After that, I took the battery apart, but nothing happened.
Have you got any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use my laptop in the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to receive the #PRS_ORG# delivery up to my room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is.....
Even when on tour and still carrying lots of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
This camera bag can hold up to 20 liters of equipment, even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday items, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical storage solutions in the individually configurable interior.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalistic design of the Everyday Backpack Series has become a proverbial - with Peak Design's innovative solutions, the interior of the backpack is reliably protected while still granting instant access to photo gear.
It works with two possibilities: Either conventionally through the lid latch, which can be secured with the MagLatch-screwless closing system, a highly thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself at the Messenger Bags.
Inside the closure is a metal latch with matching anchor bolts on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most other backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different “fill levels”: there are four anchor points, sturdily riveted, to which the closure handle can be attached.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is more lightly loaded, you take a lower one.
The latch and the hook are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without using the hook.
The second option differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks in a fundamental way: Besides the flap closure, there is also a side-release buckle on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with a top-access opening - you don't have to rummage through the contents!
This clever detail greatly enhances the everyday usability of the rucksack: If you are carrying not only your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage as well.
With the Everyday Backpack you can customize the interior (more details below) and easily separate both items without having to worry about them getting mixed up - and through the two side openings you can also access them independently.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side, so that you can access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the daily essentials remain securely stored in the left backpack compartment and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it is going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the task.
Spedition has announced that they will be contacting the customer to arrange the return of the wrongly delivered table.
Up to now I have not received any message.
I would like to have the transaction completed immediately.
I have already been in contact with the third support staff, with none of them I got further than a promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is then to be expected, when the chest could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help.
Wishing you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I had ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected was not something I could have anticipated and I was unable to handle it in a timely manner.
However, I have accepted the damage as a customer and this I will not accept.
Rotiing brake discs are designed for the demands of dynamic drivers, who appreciate reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotring brake discs are manufactured from castings and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All the made-to-order glasses are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to each glass and pattern.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which takes into account the contouring of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The made in this way tuned discs ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the grooves improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake shoes.
Aesthetic features of our tuned wheels emphasize their attractive and distinctive appearance, thereby highlighting the character of each car.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing towns in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, who is seeking wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the nearby rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must exceed your pioneer colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You have to choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to obtain additional actions or to modify the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge pieces, you can refine your individual playing style with subtle adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year when California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board to carry out actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most Pioneers, it receives a Sperre!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players will take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolvermen.
When all the actions are completed, the Pioneers return.
The Spinner rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on forever until the Announcer has moved five times, thus completely covering all locations and the year ends.
There is a shootout, in which the players Coloma must defend themselves against an attack by enraged bandits.
When the players have added enough Revolvermen to the posse and are numerically superior, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they will receive less reward or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Usually I am insured with DPD and I can track my shipments (sometimes games come wrapped in bubble wrap and packaging paper).
If you are a collector, then I can send the item in a cardboard box for an additional fee of 2 Euros, so that it will not reach any printing presses.
Why Children Are Not Tyrannical. Documentary, ARD Mediathek.
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest in talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Will Be Tyrannized" (2 I'm a big fan of the work of the late, great, Dr. Seuss. His books have always been a source of fun and creativity for me. I recently came across this great quote from him:"Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind."I think this quote is a great reminder to be true to yourself and not worry about what other people think. It's important to be yourself and express your feelings, even if it means risking criticism or judgement from others.I'm sure you've heard the phrase "If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything". This quote by Malcom X is a reminder to stand up for what you believe in and not be swayed by the opinions of others.I think it's important to remember that we all have the right to our own opinions and beliefs, and it's up to us to decide what is right and wrong. It's important to be able to think for ourselves and not be influenced by external sources
Former patients and guardians are now leveling severe accusations against him.
Please adjust yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never put themselves in a position of power over the child.
Our aim must always be to give the child space for its development and to create a framework for it as large as possible, given the circumstances.
It's still shaking me.
Holtschek: Countries discussing the loss of the triple vaccine test requirement.
The Health Ministers of the Länder want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide abolishment of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people.
"We need clarity quickly whether and when the three-times vaccinated can be exempt from the testing obligation", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus for vaccination", said Holetschek.
The German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to present a proposal at the Health Ministers' Conference on the next day, Tuesday.
I will also send the lamp back.
How should I go there?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however I cannot see how high the seat height is.
Can you help me further?
I can't handle my #PRS_ORG# anymore.
Advertisement: Oops, there has been a mistake.
Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated my contact data.
What can be the cause of this?
What you describe will be referred to as *Awareness*, which is sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is the most common experience, followed by seeing images and feeling pain the least.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of Awareness, since one needs to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the Narcotic Agreement.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex had** no awareness **per definition.**
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty rights.
At least they should take away the broken chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check to see if they can at least take back the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose money.
I sent you an email which you have not answered.
Can you ask the question again?
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to my chosen room.
The Spediteur is a company #NAME#.
I just called there.
He told me they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, since I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why wasn't I called?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an impresario.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow goodbye to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news arrives that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for life."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most popular are europallets, standardised wooden palettes which are mainly used in the European region as load carriers.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Statistik Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million Euro.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually, is not raised.

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received here last week many great tips for the perfect goulash.
There was it for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that.
I have finally gotten to the taste of it and would like to cook a roulade for the first time on Silvester.
I will set up a cattle fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going on now?
What happened to the books or how can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'm getting better.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund had been processed.
Although it has not yet been spent, the money is still with me.
Would you please check it?
Where there is still Christmas ham in Lübeck.
For many people, Goose or Duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas Tree and presents.
Have they not yet bought any chicken?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier's output stage contributes significantly to the heat and fatness of its guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Scheme.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controls you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
The amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, allowing one to reduce the sound level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion.
It had already started to sound like it might be possible to access a reserve of power with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, if it ever got too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, you can access the full potential of the VT+ Series in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line input.
This signal is processed with a box simulation so that you will get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
An auxillary power outlet can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate vocal coach.
If you purchase the VFS5 Footpedal, you can also conveniently trigger the sounds, adjust the volume, mute/unmute the effects, and change the tempo of the compatible effects using your feet.
This is essentially required for live deployment.
With its new powerpacks, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it at other places.
Is there any possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it too low for a table?
I would then like to send it back.
Can you help me further?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update regarding the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a refund or a gift card.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
If the item I don't need costs more than 1000 euros, then it's too much.
I just received my shipment and would like to know if screws were included as part of the shipment.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (Door) at the designated hinge.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded.

Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Talks
At the negotiations over the revival of the international atomic agreement, Iranian officials reported progress.
"Both sides are standing on the brink of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna."
This is a "positive and important development", since initially there had been no agreement even on the topics to be discussed.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks to revive the agreement had been resumed after a week-long break.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now the German federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, it lies above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia is the only German state which has exceeded the mark of 1000 cases of Corona infection on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new cases of infection per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which always had the highest incidence nationwide, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus infection and 16 additional deaths related to the infection were reported within a day.
200 people who were severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
There can be delays in reporting crime on weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand it.
Since the delivery is expected to begin in March, it might take until then.
I have to print it and stick it onto the package and then give it to the post, right?
Do I have to click/select/fill anything else here?
That is what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return shipping myself.
8 euro return postage fee is in my opinion a dishonesty.
It is time for changes.
The German Bundestag has greeted me, I am here in Strasbourg in the Plenary Hall of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post here for?
When one looks back at the activities of the past months of the Bundestag, one can conclude that it is not extinct.
We have gotten into a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Where did it happen?
Most likely it is simply a matter of being unhappy with how certain things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last days, there has been an increasing feeling that many people here are really looking forward to the federal election.
What we must change.
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking which one wants to keep it alive.
The spark came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of this project and found a, simply put, garbage heap.
After much hesitation and revision, several people from the community have found each other and are eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call upon everyone once more to participate, for only then can this project have a future existence.
We have created a Discord server for discussion, where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete tasks together.
You can join the server by clicking on this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair election system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten a few things, but that's not too bad, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together, and let's make decisions democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade that will be delivered yet.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another hanging at your place.
I put it together and noticed it then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Is the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# also available in large sizes, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee to me that the faulty wardrobe will be picked up soon.
Please do it now.
I haven't found a suitable packaging, but I'll unpack the shelf as much as possible for the pickup - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get these or to decide on the return to sender?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like.
She used to live vegetarian for a while, but now eats meat only occasionally.
I was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought that by being a vegetarian I would be helping the animal world, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty by doing so.
Therefore my decision to go vegan.
In that moment I had the impression that they were starting to feel annoyed, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm asking myself if my answer was too "plump".
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that vegans are quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without them wanting it to happen.
A vegan-loving harmony-seeking person greets you.
It is not an exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not able to pick up my return at the designated date, as #PRS_ORG# has notified me.
Since I cannot be there due to a funeral, it cannot be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards, I will be available continuously.
Lahnstein Water Rescue Equipment Fitted with 45,000 Euro Grant from the State
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Innenminister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 Euros for a new rescue vehicle for the Volunteer Fire Department of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 Euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this endeavor," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The Equipment Wagon is used by the Diving Team Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks both above and below water in the water and ice rescue, as well as in the technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, people are used to dealing with increasing investments: The boom of the hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Mosel rivers as well as the further rising usage of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations however nothing has worked. I have uninstalled and reloaded the app NICHTS.
I am a bit frustrated because it has taken a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to purchase 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values were measured at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% relative humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values may vary depending on the type of pocket torch, its age and the environment.
The burning duration in the stage of Low includes the burning duration with reduced brightness due to the Overheating Protection.

Thanks first of all for taking the time to be involved in this, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar role, meaning we were both firearms carriers in the executive, furthermore I do not wish to go into it any further!
I always find the question of rights and lefts to be very simplistically posed.
Generally, one should say that the state employee is more likely to come from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It is clear that people on the right side of the political spectrum are attracted to uniforms and weapons carriers. This is also obvious that these people then have difficulty dealing with the real world. This is also clear, because you have in addition to the average white people, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I mean not the overly feminine stereotypical gay, but rather normal men and women who do not make it obvious when they talk about it). And I can rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or set this for you.
Even these marginalized groups represent themselves, even though it may sound comical at first, my experience shows that they have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel alienated by overly-liberal policies, even though these policies supposedly aim to help them or make them feel more accepted, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, which however openly express their opinion or even openly plan state-threatening plans, which is overly exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have been on foreign deployments to start making generalizations and even say things that are politically incorrect or controversial.
It is also possible that one might occasionally meet like-minded people who enjoy a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it will be successfully combatted and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered from the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not sold out.
I placed my order in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is not deliverable anymore.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# Organizer for #NUMBER# Euros to Germany or is this organizer available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner firm.
However, at the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves, which are filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Is the child orderly?
Hello, I have been occupied by a matter for some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with little free time), but I have always had difficulty keeping my household clean and organized.
There are always phases in which nothing happens, and then suddenly it hits me and I start cleaning and organizing.
However, it is actually never the case that someone would spontaneously come to visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually loses housekeeping against work and lack of enthusiasm.
The kitchen is still cleaned on a regular basis since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you been able to become an orderly child?
We haven't done it yet but have been working on it for a while.
For me, there is no motivation to clean up, it just doesn't bother me. As long as there is no visitor and the place is always neat, the kitchen is usable.
Is it better to have a bigger incentive for the child or to remain sloppy?
I am looking forward to your answers.
This exclusive, new, and high-quality cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for near-unrestricted movement.
Pre-shaping with specialized further shaping at the joints for improved movement freedom (at arm and knee bends).

The edges of the inner seams have been bent for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all available armband computers).
Career in Social Work - As Someone with a Self-Doubting Personality Disorder?
I have completed an education in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting again and studying social work.
The Problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
It roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a rational level, but it is difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I have gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather not work as a street worker or in an open youth center but rather in examples such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete everyday life really is like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already causes problems in my job (emotionally), because it always brings me down whenever there is something to criticize in my code ("just simple things messed up") and it is difficult for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how it works"/"I'm just wasting everyone's time with my questions"/"he has to think of me as incompetent").
I will probably have problems in every job but I wanted to mention it here.
Did they return the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation.
I am waiting for a appointment for pickup.
What do they mean by "return to sender" please!
When I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG#, I receive a message that I am not authorized to access this book.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a confirmation of my order for my dresser.
The protein taken in with the food (Eiweiß) is broken down by the bird in its stomach and intestines into the individual amino acid building blocks. From these blocks the bird rebuilds its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather growth.
The feather formation of the nestling and the feather renewal of the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the organism as a whole.
Please note that Nekton-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the reproductive cycle.
Following this standard gift from NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral supplement).

Statement of a Church Member in Conflict with the Constitution
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree should be felled.
Application for permission to fell a tree in the community forest.
A worker wrote to me that felling of fruit trees and thus also walnut is not part of the regulation.
In the Constitution, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Okay, then I still have a spare sofa without any use.
Could you offer me a discount or a gift card?
What were expensive?
I believe it, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euro and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you check it?
Emergency Notification: Serious Traffic Accident at Selb
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
The police press alarm currently reports (2:03 PM) that a car was overtaken in the wrong lane.
There are injured people.
I understand.
Good, then thank you again, it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career life.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is not so great, since my beloved head is currently processing everything it can.
Before I start here now.. in short: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing a re-ref as a cross-trainer.
Originally, I was studying something else and worked in a related field (so as to remain anonymous, I will not specify any details here).
It was all too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
Eventually, I landed a job as a teacher and was sure it was the right choice - even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I was okay with it.
I am now at the third "I am googling other job postings" place.
And it has been half a year already.
Before each painting I always decided to keep going and finish the piece, afterwards I can always turn back.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Although there are holid Home / News / 2018 / 03 / 27 / The Future of Work: How Technology is Changing the Way We WorkThe Future of Work: How Technology is Changing the Way We WorkThe way we work is changing.

Before the exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but it was my weekend and my celebration evening as well.
I had free time.
And the stress on the job was equal in the moments.
I can't handle the family celebration stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that further agitate me.
Generally speaking, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the Ref is doing well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't do so already.
I'm asking myself if I want to keep on struggling with this kind of work for the rest of my life - especially since I'm reading your contributions -, or if I should rather go back to the old area, where I felt appreciated, had free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but still adequately paid and done as part of a team and not as an individual fighter like it is nowadays.
But then I ask myself whether I wouldn't be back at the same place a year later, feeling unhappy.
You may notice that it is all a bit confusing, but perhaps you outsiders have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely done and ready to cry at the smallest thought.
I will not make any decisions now, as it will likely lead to nothing good.
But maybe your views can help me to at least get a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which would be enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and apologizing for the whiny tone of my message.
I hope my situation has become at least a little bit clearer.
Since their introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, resulting in a combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new Modeling Engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amplifiers contain, of course, the three-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This relies in part on real analog circuits, as these can capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this intricate circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances can only be heard.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even change and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you always imagined them to be.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily attributed to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Since then, it has been refined several times in order to meet the increasing sound requirements, which resulted in a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new Valvetronix series was designed so that all guitarists will find the maximum sound variety they're looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage particularly determines the tube-like character of the amplifier and developed accordingly the VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
The 12AX7 tube-loaded Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the subtle nuances and unique sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA is still going on.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure panels, it can be adapted to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes up to full-frame reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can store a lot of accessories.
If you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and photography-unrelated items.
Drone pilots can also make a great choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, since it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including its remote controller and accessories.
Volcanic Eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has become the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Up until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island before the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data is available about past eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has recently decreased, but volcanologists are still reluctant to make any predictions about when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-owned TV station RTVE.
Damages in Million-Dollar Range
Since the beginning of the eruption, the lava, which has been over 1000 degrees Celsi Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalA new public artwork has been unveiled at Antrim Area Hospital.The artwork, which is located in the hospital’s main entrance, was created by local artist, David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture made from steel and aluminium and is inspired by the hospital’s history and the surrounding landscape.The artwork was funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the hospital’s Arts Committee.The unveiling of the artwork was attended by the Chair of the Arts Committee, Councillor Pauline Rankin, the Arts Council’s Head of Arts Development, Siobhan Campbell, and the hospital’s Chief Executive, John Compton.The artwork will be enjoyed by staff, patients and visitors for many years to come.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava flow.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses were created off the coast due to cooled lava, with a combined size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is of vital importance to the island, was particularly hard hit, with about half of the 85,000 inhabitants depending on it either directly or indirectly. It had already been in a state of crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas suffering severe damage, reported the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is standing at the door and the children can hardly wait for it.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have bound together with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something enchanting.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that can still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-preserving "social contract of primitive peoples" can be renewed and infused with life.
How Nicholas became the Christkind.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who established the link between Christmas and gift-giving.
On the occasion of St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged either verbally or materially.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women a bag of gold in one night, so that they could escape a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving originated the popular custom of filling the children's shoes with gifts in Germany.
Protestants objected to this practice because they consider intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed the Nikolaus into the Christkind and thereby established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details so closely, it only angers a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas celebrations with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the Advent season.
Today, one can find shoes in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to highly desirable luxury watches, fulfilling everyone's desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian-oriented countries, there is a cheerful hubbub over who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the region whether the Christkind or the Weihnachtsmann appears on Christmas Eve. The Weihnachtsmann is essentially a kind of Nikolaus who has acquired some distinct characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white drunken beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his slew, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas time.
In Spain, the Three Kings bring the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia sometimes bring mythical creatures the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who gained some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that are pulling the slew.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is responsible for the gift-giving.

Police Shoot Suspected Bankrobber Near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a man was shot by the police on Saturday who was armed.
The police announced, that a caller had reported, that a man had entered a bank and a gambling shop with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by the police.
It sounded like shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Around the Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Even other members of the royal family live there.

Pill Problem
Hello lovely women,
I hope I did everything right, it is after one year my first post.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago because I was experiencing unbearable pain during my period and terrible PMS symptoms before my period.
I would rather stay here because I already take too many medications that I have to choose from.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten a two-year break from work and had picked up 100 explosive pimples all over my face.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
During the two-year pause, nothing had ever really normalized.
Someone might have some tips to avoid this from happening again.
My cosmetics are fragrance-free and quiet, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
The love of the skin is so nice.
He had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread knotty fungal infections and the acne problem.
I have tried various diets during my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar-free, milk-free, and meat-free diet because nothing else worked as well.
It could also be that it's simply the worm in there, but if I have a construction site everywhere I'd rather not search any longer what else is wrong.
I had already given her colleague the seminar paper.
I wrote and then I lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What would there be to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe something was wrong.

Planning a lesson (EK)
Hello lovely colleagues and colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer, and I enjoy it, but I currently have great difficulty planning my lessons in the subject of Earth Science in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can only use the board, a textbook and a projector as my medium.
In school I can only copy software for free (which drives me nuts).
I need to plan my hours very carefully at the moment.
We are currently discussing geographic factors, and each hour is standing for itself.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I need it for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually by creating an assignment sheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the problem solutions in the book I am rather unhappy.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a teacher of earth science can help me become more time-efficient when working with the book.
I would really enjoy it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided to get a new guitar #PRS_ORG# but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G rule for Christmas shopping.
Most shops only allow those who have been vaccinated or have recovered to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments losses of sales.
He also had a possible solution ready.
According to the German Trade Association (HDE), 2G regulations will damage the Christmas business of the retail sector.
Complaints have been made about a decrease in sales of non-daily items, according to HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of them had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off their Christmas shopping.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year has now become a hole with no bottom", said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions lost in the past week approximately one third of their pre-crisis sales.
It's only running well in the grocery store and online.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main businessman.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he emphasized.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the bandage regulation should be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all shops with the given bandage that day.
In addition, surveillance should be increased in the retail sector - as has already been done in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the specialist in shopping centres Immobilienkonzern Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping season, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts will be made to find solutions and to obtain approval for them.
This includes the so-called "Bandchen" solution, where visitors, for example, have to present their 2G identification at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that of a club hotel, can enter the shops without further ado. dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a mistake, which was tried to be hidden with a yellow filler.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and taped it up.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is handled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
One of the special features of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
In addition, it is also suitable for reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is installed in hard to access places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery).
The user can adjust the brightness and color temperature of the panel via three settings.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply done by pressing longer on one of the storage buttons and finished.
The Memory Controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionalities, as it allows for operation with cost-effective and long-lasting NP-F AAA batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value is shown in the two display screens (the left one upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to constantly supply the headlights with power via the included power cable.
The construction of the searchlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm hose as an attachment, so you can directly connect it to your photostand.
The inclination can be reliably set using leveling screws at both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components were of the highest quality and therefore designed for long life and hard use.
In addition, a steering angle sensor is included in the delivery.
The package includes a great bag as well.
You can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might purchase without any problems.
I'm sorry, I got the wrong size :(
The party we wanted to throw: Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, it seemed as though the previously winless Hessen were on their way to their second consecutive Bundesliga defeat.
However, then the SGE turned around, shot itself within a good hour of frustration over a mediocre season start and won furiously with 5:2. "It's insane, what the guys did today", yelled coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "general compliment, to all of them, who were involved", out of it.
It initially looked like a dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, who were still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2-0.
What then happened, impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance, according to Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who had not played since the fourth game and had overcome a muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was especially proud of the result for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner will now focus on the upcoming tasks, but he also feels well-positioned regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional lives.
We wanted to "take it step by step" and "stay humble" by comple The 2016-2017 school year has been an incredibly successful year for the students and staff at St. John’s.

Next up is already on Wednesday in the course of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I will receive a grade for the mail that my package has been returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get redirected, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order has to be cancelled again?
It would then unfortunately mean that I wouldn't be able to order it again because it has already taken too long.
Have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for Handball Women before the Quarterfinal against Spain
Germany's handball team slunk away after their humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty gazes from the court.
The DHB selection ended their World Cup group stage with a heavy 16:32 (8:13) loss in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now face Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must approach Spain differently.
After losing their first match in the tournament, Germany closed the Group III Main Round with 8 wins and 2 losses, finishing as runners-up behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a terrible game that we have to delete, said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a spot in the semifinals, a significant improvement is needed on Tuesday to keep the dream of a first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German shooter in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense", said midfielder Xenia Smits and added: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not on the same level from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the start.
Mistakes in the attack and defensive lapses were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after just seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was on site immediately and prevented further damage with some parades.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9 minutes and 30 seconds, when Grijseels finished a quick counterattack successfully.
The expected ignition was not this, however.
Despite the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women were unable to make much of an impact - and when they did manage to get into the game, they often fell victim to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game ended in a 3:10 score after 20 minutes, as Mia Zschocke was shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals she can still participate.
It wasn't until the second half that the German team started to play better, and by the time the first half ended, they had managed to score five goals.
The already faint hope for a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes with the score of 9:19.
The Green-Yellow Sparrows were at it again in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent who is a contender for the medals at the end of the season.
In the following, the German team was unable to recover from their previous performance and went out as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season
Within the scope of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have acquired Nikolaus Day and are taking this opportunity to discuss our family traditions during the Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas Day, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.
How was it then at home?
How is your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
What is Stiefelputzen?
Do you want to bake cookies?
Is it OK to decorate a tree?
Is music being played?
Is the Christmas Man, the Christ Child, or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone puts in the effort and goes the extra mile around Christmas to make it as beautiful as a family can.
Is it now established traditions, or even every year something different: tell us, how it in your family happened or is happening!
Could you please send me any transaction number.. or else whatever could help.
Transfer Confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a gift code.
Just like #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers.
Does it work for them?
The title is available, I am currently working as an impaest in mobile impfteams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished, it will go on to the next part in the vaccination center for me.
I will gladly answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I am taking medication X, will the vaccine interact with it?").
My area of responsibility includes education about vaccination, determining the indication (person has the right to vaccination according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Guidelines and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation, and providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The administration of the vaccine can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical caregivers.
In my team we often don't have any pharmaceutical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but only "technical" ones, who cannot perform the injections (should they be able to?). Therefore, I have to do most of the injections myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger knows the Solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This Amberger dialect word sent in by a viewer has caused much thoughtful reflection in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unrecognized by the callers this time.
No, it was not "a man who is nervous".
And even none, "who has to go quickly".
People heard from the TV moderator that it was completely false.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused much astonishment among many people in the region.
The Hüterler, as the audience found out, is a rag that someone uses to wipe the oven.
Antony Rowley, a dialect researcher who has been frequently consulted by the Bavarian Television for years, confirmed it.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine concept, derived somehow from the more widely known Mundart word "Houden".
Which closed a educational gap - even for many who have already been living in the area Amberg for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for the last two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message is received: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Is choosing tires for a race bike really so puncture-proof?
I woke up this morning full of energy to start my training for my bike tour next week.
I said, I did it, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then it happened, what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glasssplitter on the track.
Zach, loud squeaking and my rear tire refused to go any further.
Since I couldn't get a proper replacement for my coat and gas mask due to the day of the week, I had to make do with a less than satisfactory attitude and turn around and go home.
It wasn't quite as bad as it could have been, so it might be better to practice the bike ride beforehand by doing a wheel change.
Now I am standing before a question and I hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would rather not have to deal with this problem too often.
It wasn't that bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had given me the bike until 2 pm and had driven 120km with it) were also worn out. He had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them for years.
When I think about having to do a tire change after driving for about 80-90km, I'm really grumpy :D
I was talking to an older man at the train platform when he asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplatable.
Now it sounds very attractive.
Are these really unbreakable?
I don't have the desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed later.
I still wonder: I think I have been pedalling my bike 25 times.
There is also (apparently?) a Marathon Plus tire, but the majority is wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend another type of tire for my road bike?
The Swallow Side seems to be my absolute! Law knowledge seems to be more advisable than the DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and lovely greetings!

After the publication of our new High End Broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get some new additions.
SOLO 15 is the new sprout and it reminds visually of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design includes a foot that is properly aligned to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the given circumstances at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum sound level is of secondary importance, but who still demand an exceptionally high sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is not able to generate near-unfiltered loud sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Contrary to this, she appears impressively mature and strikingly impressive and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tonally adjusted with a slight high-end boost.
This is commonly done with broadband signals to optimize the increasing bundle of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is very accurately aimed at the listening spot, delivering a clear and fine sound.
The high frequency range can be reduced and the sound image widened by turning the speaker slightly outward.
Thanks to the point source, the location of each individual component of a musical piece is extremely sharp and amazingly precise.
The suspicious low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM generate an enemy dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 adds not only to our SOLO Series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning of the project, in order to make appropriate adjustments during the construction.
If one wants to, for example, furnish the housing, then the lowering of the speaker has to be adjusted accordingly, since the furnishing adds more material.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to easily run the cable through it later.
With the help of an overlay, now the speaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be applied laterally.
This opening should be faced with a 45° phase in order to maximize the interior opening area of the speaker chassis.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get a break in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
These will now be covered with the leftover sealant from the sides, top, front, and bottom.
In addition, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The reinforcements can vary in material thickness if needed, for example, by purchasing pre-cut frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, namely the two sides and the front.
Through the use of a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex port as well as the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round file to smooth out all the edges of the actual box.
Even the top of the footrest can be rounded off with it.
In the following step, the footplate is glued to the bottom of the housing and additionally secured with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm) of the screw holes of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the case was cleaned of wood dust (absorb / evacuate), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
During this process, the entire uncut cable is fed through the 8 mm drill hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and is allowed to hang out approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there.
Following, the frequency changer will be prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation Manual Solo 15.
If the frequency switch has been installed and the connection terminal has been screwed, then the insulation of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is still not completed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and seal it that way.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the + lead (marked cable) must be connected to the + pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex pipe is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
To dampen vibrations, a piece of damping material is cut into two parts and spread loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I cancel an order and have it delivered in June instead?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
We are sorry but it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which requires more planning and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people there, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will begin around 0:30.
Make sure to have some cold drinks ready, plan for an excellent dinner, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
