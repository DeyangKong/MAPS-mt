The student researchers from Zhejiang University performed at the annual conference and made a great impression on the audience. Their research results caused people's minds to be blown open.
Using the air to wash hands, smell the air to diagnose diseases, and carefully search for the source of the mist last night at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these fruits are students, covering a wide range of disciplines such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students began from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical values, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The biomedical engineering team from the university showed a smartphone-sized biometric sensor on-site, which was half the size of a smartphone.
All you need to do is take a deep breath, and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of your breath.
Zhang Dingfang introduced the sensor and smartphone connection, after which air pollutants will be reported on the phone.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market. Common parameters that can be detected include temperature and heart rate.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as stone and marble, to detect chemical elements. Its sensitive "touch" allows it to deeply and accurately represent the body's health condition.
Smart Surgical Light: A Doctor's Highly Sensitive Vision Aid
In addition to smartphones, the operating room has also started using smart surgical lamps.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Invention Exhibition of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.
Zhu Lin and Shen Junfei from the Institute of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have created a new solution to the problem of traditional surgical lamps' shortcom Home » News » News » 2018 » Housing Strategy ConsultationHousing Strategy ConsultationThe Council is currently consulting on its draft Housing Strategy for 2018-2023.

Many diseases can be detected in the early stage, and surgery may be necessary. It is related to the light used in the doctor's office.
If doctors cannot identify and remove all tumor tissues in time during the early diagnosis of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has four light panels, adjusting the spectral composition, to enh A new study has found that the majority of people in the United States are not getting enough sleep, and the problem is particularly severe among younger adults.The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, found that 59% of people in the United States have insufficient sleep, defined as getting less than seven hours of sleep a night.The study also found that younger adults are particularly likely to have insufficient sleep, with 67% of people aged 18 to 25 having insufficient sleep.The study analyzed data from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveyed more than 350,000 people in the United States.The researchers found that the prevalence of insufficient sleep increased with age, from 47% among people aged 18 to 25 to 59% among people aged 26 to 64.The researchers also found that people with lower incomes, those who are less educated, and those
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and the patient's habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash hands: Saving water and feeling cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with towels, and squeezing out a handkerchief, and Li Qui Zhang and his classmates invented a "handkerchief washing device".
As long as we stand on the device for washing hands, our body weight can be pressed and out of the air.
He was like a person playing a wind instrument.
The compressed air that was released formed a fluid and combined with the water at the dragon's head.
That's great, we can finally get our hands clean and dry!
The results of the experiment showed that the effect of the experiment was the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure cleanlin Home » News » News » 2017 » Have Your Say On The Future Of Health And Social Care In Northern IrelandHave Your Say On The Future Of Health And Social Care In Northern IrelandThe Department of Health is inviting people to have their say on the future of health and social care in Northern Ireland.The consultation, which runs until 22nd November, will look at how health and social care services can be improved to meet the needs of people in Northern Ireland.The consultation will focus on a range of topics including:• How to ensure that health and social care services are joined up and accessible to people• How to ensure that services are provided in a safe and effective way• How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is responsive to people’s needs• How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is sustainable• How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is person-centred• How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is equitable• How to ensure that services are provided in a way that is cost

It felt very meaningful to hold a valid passport——a lifesaving passport.
This is one of the important skills certificates I feel is necessary besides a driving license!
Emergency measures should be taken as soon as possible. This is to prepare for and respond to unexpected events, such as a rescue operation before the arrival of the rescue vehicle.
After the accident, the rescue process of the car was still in progress. In fact, it was a critical moment. The key was still in this moment.
This is the time when we need urgent rescue.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or difficulty breathing or coughing, our window of life would be only four minutes - gold four minutes!
Therefore, the people nearby were so important!
When there is someone lying down at our feet, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing still and doing nothing, which is too scary and helpl Home / News / 2019 / 07 / 15 / The Power of One: How One Person Can Make a DifferenceThe Power of One: How One Person Can Make a DifferenceWe often think of making a difference as a collective effort, but the truth is that one person can make a difference. Every action, no matter how small, can have a ripple effect and make a difference in the world.Take the example of a single person who decides to reduce their carbon footprint. This person may choose to reduce their energy consumption, buy local and organic produce, and use reusable products. By making these small changes, they are reducing their environmental impact and making the world a better place.Another example of how one person can make a difference is by volunteering. Volunteering is a great way to give back to the community and help those in need. Whether it’s tutoring a student, helping out at a soup kitchen, or providing emotional support to a patient in a hospital,
In China, there are about 300 million people who die from unexpected deaths every year, making it the most dangerous place for heart attacks.
In the United States, the average rate of survival is 15%.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, you can survive up to 78%, with a chance of coming back from Shanghai and Beijing below 1%.
This is the first reaction of Lu Le, the founder of the company.
If a person suffers from cardiac arrest, their breathing and heartbeat will stop, as will their circulation and respiration. In this situation, CPR is useless.
We must do artificial respiration and external compression in order to possibly save a person.
I discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of mindset to learn emergency rescue quickly, but when the situation happens, they come too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to go and learn this skill, so that we can make timely reaction in the face of emergency.
Even if it is uncertain, it is still possible to save a person's life!

PS: The last picture is a record of your 25-year-old self's goals, and adding an emergency kit to the list of goals was done several months ago. However, it was really accomplished!
After I had already prepared to take other exams, I suddenly found out that there was a drowning rescue certificate as well. Since taking this drowning rescue certificate is also necessary to take the exam, I decided to take it as well. Thus, it turns out that having a drowning rescue certificate is very useful!

Because I saw the code was valid before I input it.
First, I will talk about the conclusion. I believe 'The Four Seas' is a film that has a universal appeal, from various perspectives.
But you have to say this movie is either a bright spot or it has no value, either way it's not at least entertaining enough to be chosen as a pleasure.
There are many kinds of popcorn in the cinema, allowing you to fall asleep peacefully after watching the movie. It also fills you with resentment afterward, just like the monkey on the mountain of 《Four Seas》. It can use innumerable ways to ignite your rage.
On this point, Han Cang really is a heaven-sent gentleman.
The most painful scene in the film is the one where the creature is an exact replica of the monster from the horror movie, with its body covered in seeping wounds and ragged clothing like a gust of wind.
After you finish reading it, you will be left with a feeling of doubt whether there is a hidden message in this place. However, when you think carefully, it turns out to be just a joke.
I find it difficult to understand some simple things.
The man's hometown should be located in the south, and he should live with his wife according to the customs of the place.
She wished to see the snow in the east, so she arranged for her grandfather to take her in a small slew car to the east to see the snow.
Are old people from the north going to see snow from the south?
He and his father were very relaxed.
After that, this old man didn't have any more text to read.
How did the female owner of the abandoned boat get a business license to operate a bar on it?
Why is the Flying Car Party able to quickly finish a section of the mountain road by simply pushing it?
After the car stopped in the middle of the road, the four drivers around it were looking for it in vain.
This item is too obvious.
Why did the illegal and suspicious party become a police informant?
Why didn't the police report the high-interest loan? There was a special scene in the movie where the police asked the protagonist whether there was any difficulty.
A grown man can't even use a smartphone, yet he doesn't know how to use a room key to open the door of a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel staff outside the room and sleeps outside the door.
This kind of mysterious plot twists can be found in the entire movie, and since they are too bizarre to be believed, I always feel painful when I recall them.
Besides the plot, the movie's main theme was also disappointing. It was like a collage of shallow and meaningless scenes.
You will think of a funny movie when you see the beginning of the video, but after 20 minutes you might think it's a motivational movie. After watching half of it, you might think it's a movie to show the struggles of young people in the rural area to survive. Finally, you will be confused and wonder why you watched it.
For most people, it is very familiar with various kinds of films, such as you want to make a movie car, then you need to be motivated + comic, then tell the audience one of the birds with a heavenly gift is how to take one step by step walking towards success.
If you want to take a love story, then you just old old real real talk about the joys of horseback riding, mountain climbing, and service staff girlfriend.
If you want to reflect reality, then the most important thing is to avoid anything that is too similar to the normal world.
(For example, the actor playing the role of Zhang Xiao in the musical "The Last Emperor" was burned and still managed to sing.) In this case, you can't help but be fascinated by the mysterious brain disease.
Although she was playing the role of a 5-year-old child, she was able to display her intelligence and charm in certain aspects. I don't know if it was due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I was also confused, why did Han Cang become so passionate about adding a car crash scene to his own movie?

The modern education of workers began with the trial of a modern enterprise in Chengdu.
Yesterday, the reporter from the city education committee was surprised to learn that this year, our city will be piloting the "modern apprenticeship" model of human resource development in 60 urban and rural schools. At the same time, the students accepted into the pilot program will be granted apprenticeship status and will be recruited by the trial enterprises afterwards.
The Education Bureau requires that all private schools recruit and admit students in accordance with the regulations, clearly identify student and staff roles, and sign a tripartite agreement with the school and employer. For students under 18 years old, a guardian, school, employer and student must sign a quadpartite agreement to determine the roles and responsibilities of each party and to ensure the student's safety and development in the workplace.

Doctors in South Africa: The power of social media and traditional media is strong, but it is mostly used for light diseases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the New Coronavirus is more contagious than SARS and is spreading faster.
According to the Associated Press, the spread of AIDS in South Africa has been reported by the South African doctors' organization. They said that the symptoms of the new cases of AIDS are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever similar to flu symptoms.
The organization's overall coordinator Unben Pillay (M.D.) said that he has to see about 30 patients a day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
They can control most diseases at home, and most people will recover within 10 to 14 days.
He said, this package includes elderly patients and those with health problems, such people are more likely to fall into severe complications due to the coronavirus infection.
He said, compared to the previous outbreak in Delhi, the new cases he treated had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
During the two weeks after the first case of pneumococcal meningitis was reported in the southern part of Africa, other health workers also shared similar experiences.
Although we have collected enough data, it will still take a few weeks for the doctors to observe and examine the patients. However, the early evidence provided by the patients' testimonies and data has been helpful in providing some leads.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the severe cases of the new coronavirus were found among the hospitalized patients, which is half of the proportion of the first wave of the epidemic. The average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the recent cases in South Africa, only 3% died, while in the early cases of the virus in South Africa, the mortality rate was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the head of the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, cited data and other reports to say, “Currently, almost all the evidence suggests that this is a mild illness.”
He still said: "We need to obtain the data in the later period."
Under normal circumstances, the time for hospitalization and death is delayed, while we have entered this wave of the epidemic only two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospital rates, as well as testing current vaccines and treatments.
Despite the fact that the novel coronavirus has become the world's most important infectious disease, there have been cases of outbreaks in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the pandemic.
According to the health department, the number of new cases of illness in Guangdong Province in December increased by 400%. Tests showed that the majority of the cases were the variant of the parvovirus B19.

Education assessment: What to do when a child is in danger?
If the famous public service advertisement "No Buying, No Selling, Just Don't Kill" is compared to the popular "Buying and Selling" mentality, then in a good environment without coercion, everyone can resist the temptation of buying and selling, thus reducing the risk of being caught, the cost is high, and the crime will not occur.
On the recent, the Public Security Bureau Criminal Investigation Department cracked down on the missing children information urgently released on the platform.
This is the authoritative platform for publishing information about lost children and quickly finding them with the help of the internet.
After installing the App named "Tuan Yuan", I felt warm and cozy.
The new technology is not only called "culture" and "emotion", but also information and application. It is practical and effective.
To apprehend a child who has run away, the most important thing is to ensure their safety and freedom.
Only then was it the judging and punishing of suspected people.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many "big words".
Before breaking the case, it is important to prioritize the physical safety of the victim.
In times of crisis, it is important to take a step back and think before speaking or acting. When discussing sensitive topics like whether or not children should face death penalty, it is better to be cautious and mindful.
According to the experience of handling such cases, people tend to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the money.
Searching for a missing child can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The further the child is from home, the more difficult it is to find them and the more challenging the investigation becomes.
Under such circumstances, extracting information from platforms like "Questions and Answers" can be directly helpful in uncovering cases and finding missing children, which is an effective action.
After all, "putting an end to corruption" is a task that requires an entire legal system to be set up properly.
To protect the rights of the vulnerable, from perfecting the law to ensuring justice, and from secreting the law to compassionately embracing the weak, all of which require unremitting efforts.
In addition to preventing the sale of children, it can be done better in the family and society.
For example, a common case, a family of three took a nap at the train station, only to wake up and find their child missing.
As a parent of a two-year-old, you cannot expect them to have enough self-protection skills. However, as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a certain degree of protective consciousness.
The parents and the child were floating in the river, and they also put the child under the protection of the stable, which was the most effective preventive measure against the child being abducted.
From the police's perspective, cracking down on illegal activities is important, but it is also important to pay attention to and supervise the children involved in the illegal activities.
Unlawful behavior of an individual is often just a link in a chain.
According to the law of my country, the punishment for selling children is 5 years imprisonment; in cases of special severity, the death penalty may be applied, and all the criminal's assets will be confiscated.
At the height of the crackdown on crime, the sale of children has become more and more difficult. It is evident that this type of crime is particularly serious and deserves heavier punishment.
There are still many shoplifting cases happening every year.
As people's concept of childrearing and education became more and more shallow, the law became increasingly weak.
For the education of law and regulations, it should be synchronized and advanced with the times.
To effectively control counterfeiting, it cannot be done solely through strict enforcement of laws and regulations by the government.
If the market is widely spread, the sellers will be eager to make money and constantly innovate selling methods, forming a confrontational relationship with the buyers and leading to a low-efficiency deadlock.
Therefore, it is beneficial to have a clear understanding of the law, as well as to educate oneself on consumer rights and responsibilities, which can help prevent and control crime.

He also expressed his plan to convene the second Global People's Congress in 2020.
The Taiwanese Government Representative, Peng Hong, and other pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong, including Joshua Wong, were present at the second day of the summit.
Bowen said: "We know that our work is so difficult and overwhelming."
But we also know, we can welcome the challenge, because I have said before, just as this meeting showed, democracy is nowhere to be found.

We must continue to demonstrate and safeguard our democracy with the concerted effort of the entire society.
He said: "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democracy, promote reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be able to resist the temptation of power for our own benefit and prioritize the public interest."
The second day of the National People's Congress focused on protecting human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as opposing digital totalitarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is the "International Human Rights Day".
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democracy movement is facing a great challenge globally, especially with the emergence of new digital technologies.
He said, “This is the time to uphold a shared vision of common values and standpoints, as well as democratic spirit.”
This requires in-depth dialogue on social issues, to tackle inequalities, fight corruption, update social contracts, invest in quality education and expand women's and girl's opportunities.
This also requires a resolute rejection of all forms of nationalism, racism, and extremism, including the use of all available technologies to achieve this revolution.
A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, delivered a speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, to remind the international community to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other minority ethnic groups in China.
He said, “Over the long run, the world has always been subject to the Chinese rising, yet without establishing any mechanism to hold it accountable.”
This is why political figures and social leaders must work together.
We must use all of our resources (including those we possess) to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task.
Luo Guanzhong also urged the world to unite and resist the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some people in your midst are afraid of losing the Chinese market, or don't understand the threat posed by the CCP's authoritarian values.
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
At the Roundtable Discussion on "Fighting Against Digital Isolation and Defending Democracy Values" attended by Taiwan's Vice President Chen Chien-jen, the Executive Yuan released a video statement emphasizing Taiwan's stance as the frontline against authoritarianism and oppression.
He also shared his experience on how to build trust and transparency in order to combat the novel coronavirus.
He said: "At the frontline of the struggle against authoritarianism in Taiwan, we have remained steadfast and have always advanced the cause of global freedom, democracy and human rights. We have also played a leading role in promoting them."
During the pandemic period, various authoritarian governments around the world have been rationalizing their violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests. This has resulted in a retreat of global democracy.
Nevertheless, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down the flag to fight fake news.
While the second day of the National People's Congress was going on, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for serious violations of human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company for using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hi, the live chicken that was just brought to the restaurant is very delicious.
I want to try out playing basketball, but I'm afraid of myself getting too frustrated and not wanting to continue. So I'm looking for a place with a reasonable price to practice my skills.

In fact, there is a lot of discussion about the clothing and accessories worn by the petite girl with body image.
The girl wearing the skirt can't be too short or too long, the difference should be just at the knee, which can cover the bulky thighs and hide the plump calves.
If the skirt is too short, it will make you look fat.
When you are too tall, you will feel embarrassed and bulky.
If you wear different colors for each level, it will make you look taller, as if you are wearing a different outfit for each level. When you look up, it will create a sense of growth.
In reality, many petite girls are wearing deep colors such as black, navy, and burgundy as their signature look. Deep colors are a great way to hide their body and make them look taller. Meanwhile, the high-end and elegant look of a black short skirt is also a favorite choice for petite girls.
Wearing a black short skirt will make people think you are slimmer.
If your legs are very fat, your pants and shoes shouldn't be worn too tightly.
The more diverse the population becomes, the more important it is to preserve one's own culture and customs. The colors should not be too bright and flashy.
To avoid people paying too much attention to your legs and feet, let them feel a little bit obese.
For the little girl who is slightly chubby, it is important to teach her how to dress and accessorize properly.
Don't wear too-tight clothes that make you look like a stuffed sausage. Additionally, avoid wearing short or too-short skirts or dresses that make your legs look too thin. Instead, opt for a long, flowing skirt or dress that covers your legs and hides any unwanted bulk. You can also try wearing a black opaque tights or a net skirt (with a small grid-like pattern) to further conceal any unwanted curves. Finally, complete the look with a loose-fitting blouse and a classy scarf or shawl to create a chic and elegant silhouette.
Of course, the short-legged girl was also worth studying.
The fat girl should choose a matching color for the short skirt, so that the fat girl's bulky figure will be highlighted with an increase of height.
Wearing shorts and high heels together can make your legs look longer and stylish, which is the hottest pairing for the summer!
If you are plus-sized, but have slim legs, we recommend you choose a beautiful feeling of long skirt.
Not only can it block out large pores, but it can also showcase your advantages.
A-shirt will make you look slim, especially for plump girls. When you wear it, choose a tight-fitting one to form a layered effect and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt and shorts can be a great option for those who are plus-sized.
The girl who was petite was also able to exude a fashionable feeling.
As long as they can grasp the rules of wearing clothes and accessories, even the most petite girls will become the focus of attention.
After changing your clothes and putting on makeup, you should also exercise more in life and strive to get up early to break away from the label of "micro-shrinking" women. Let's have fun!

Girls donating money to help their sisters in need - China News Net
A young girl was standing in front of a wooden plank at the entrance of a park in Hangzhou. The plank had the words "human flesh and blood" carved on it. There was also a arrow pointing upwards with the number "10" on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of "Hangzhou girl donating 'arrows' for sisters' recruitment" suddenly exploded in the friend circle.
The photo shows a young girl standing in front of a tall wooden plank with the words “Human Skin, One Bullet” written on it. It implies that after paying a fee, one can use a bow and arrow to shoot the target.
This behavior triggered a heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City, Xiangshan Sub-Bureau, spread the news that the person in charge of the incident had verified it to the reporter of the New China News Agency. The police confirmed that the girl had done such an impulsive and excessive act, but this behavior is not worthy of praise. After warnings and advice, the girl had already left the local police station.
The little girl on the street corner was collecting donations for the charity. She held a donation box in one hand and a signboard with the words “Donate Now” in the other.
In the picture, a long-haired girl was posing in front of a wooden board with the word “个” written in black ink. There was also a picture of a person, a rocket, and the number 10. In front of her, another wooden board had her bank account and WeChat/Payment account information written on it.
This picture caused a controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think that this behavior is similar to "beggars asking for alms", and there are also many netizens expressing their sympathy.
We arrived at the square around 10am when we found the situation. By then, the crowd had already dispersed.
The police station near the scene of the incident accepted the media interview of the local people, and the two girls were dressed up in a youthful and beautiful manner, with one of them being around 20 years old.
A girl was crying in the middle of the road, begging the people around to play the game with her. Another girl was standing beside her, helping her drink and talking about her sick sister, who needs an urgent surgery fee. Please help them.
We have contacted the police in Guizhou and found out that the girl is raising money for her sister, who has leukemia.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City Xiaoshan Branch informed the reporter of the New Beijing News that the girl's name is Jia Jia and she is 12 years old. She had donated money to help her sister, who is also named Jia Jia.
Although the treatment still requires a lot of money, people were too busy to think of a good way to donate or contribute. Therefore, they resorted to such behavior.
He said, during the entire process, two girls acted as spotters, one responsible for aiming the gun and the other one for taking pictures and uploading them to Weibo.
After the regulation of the department, the bow and arrow used by the security guards do not belong to the management scope.
The person in charge expressed that "We do not encourage taking this kind of donation approach."
After the warning and threats from the police, she had already left the police station.

What will be the hottest year in 2021?
The Beijing Olympics was without doubt.
Can only the healthy athletes win the medals?
The article "Quick Look! An Olympic Project Manager Can Crush Any Giant Brand" in the front section of the newspaper was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can always be the first to act and no one can catch up: shifting bricks, dealing with differences, and suffering from nightmares are all part of their daily lives. Saving fires, bailing out, and apologizing are also not an option.
This article is like a funny joke, but it also reflects the daily struggles of project managers and their bitterness towards current project management work.
Employees who manage project work gradually choose to relieve their work stress through various actions.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certified project management professionals increases, more and more project management practitioners are able to enhance their project management capabilities by studying.
According to the 20th Anniversary Report of China Project Management (1999-2019), the total number of people who took the PMP exam in China has reached 600,000 times, with a pass rate of 42%, and the effective retention rate of 30%. This accounts for 31.2% of the global PMP retention rate.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing steadily, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on simple and straightforward approaches can no longer guarantee success. The ever-changing work environment has made us realize that we need to learn and explore new paths.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can one be assured of smooth project management work without any hindrance?
Many beginner project managers expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they were able to gain a systematic understanding of project management's ten major domains and five process groups, however, when it came to actual project management work, they still felt like they were wading through a sea of fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, absence of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and workflow support, work becomes unstable, unable to accurately predict, lack of control and sensitivity; members are unclear about the division of labor, "old oil barrel" in the team does not know how to address the cross-departmental communication difficulties, project progress is difficult to promote.
Therefore, by focusing on product innovation and development management, we have helped numerous excellent companies to nurture a large number of product managers and project managers, as well as gain the "China Enterprise Development Management Talent Training Base" honor.
This is a way of learning chemistry online by breaking down the course into small pieces, combining real-life cases from various development-type companies, tools and methods, helping you grasp essential knowledge and standards of project management, and advancing your own project management.
This is also an opportunity to let the enterprise use lower costs and less investment, to promote the project manager's training process, to bring high efficiency operation results to the enterprise.
With confidence, we can first observe other students' evaluation of this course: This course is not only taught by the Central China-Huawei-Summer team (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines advanced project management theories and numerous famous business cases.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, abundant form templates to help students convert the knowledge they learned into real-world applications.

Advocating for Consumers' Rights and Responsibilities before the Double 12 Shopping - China Economic Observer － Professional Economy News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" online payment business transaction volume has reached 1.77 trillion yuan, far exceeding last year's record.
The booming of full-of-flowers, red-packed gifts, grabbing people's eyes and broadcasting live with goods again and gaining great benefit, this hot consumption trend has made people feel proud of the national consumption strength and made people reflect on the impact of consumption on society and contemporary mainstream consumption groups.
Before coming to "Double Twelve" shopping spree, "Zhe Xin" (short for "Zhe Xin" Financial Limited Company) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the public, especially young people, to build good consumption habits and resist blind consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 2020 Consumer Finance Sustainability Index Report, the national consumer finance sustainability index was 66.81, higher than in 2019 by 2.04.
On the whole, the performance of Chinese citizens in the financial consumption layer is better, but there is still a large difference in the financial behavior and skills in different aspects, and it is necessary to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Older people and younger people have a relatively low financial literacy level, “one-child” will still be the focus of financial education. The report published by Nordeusen and the Central Television Finance Report published by 2019-2020 China Young Consumption Report show that young people have a huge consumption potential, credit and consumption become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of the people have no debt accumulation, young people although overall rational consumption trend, but with the outside world attached to the "excessive exuberance" label, but some young people's excessive consumption, fashions and behaviors, thereby creating excessive debt pressure and risk, even causing social problems to gradually increase, financial institutions should be brave to accept social responsibility, and to provide positive guidance.
As a long-term, stable financial institution, we are committed to providing quality and caring services to help people build a happy life. We advocate responsible consumption and encourage people to make rational and reasonable consumption decisions. We also strive to improve the quality of consumer services and increase the sense of responsibility of consumers, especially young people.
Over the past few years, we have been dedicated to promoting financial literacy among young people in China through various activities such as organizing the Financial Inclusion Challenge, partnering with top-tier universities to launch innovation and practice competitions, and providing rational guidance to help young people form a rational consumption mentality and plan their consumption demands in a rational way. This has helped them accumulate wealth and build a better life.
Twelve steps have been taken to reach this place. We should be aware of our consumption habits and spend our money reasonably and prudently. We should resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid getting into debt trap. This will help us lead a healthy and prosperous life.
When consuming, you must plan ahead of time and pay on time to avoid penalty. Amount and force of payment will determine the credit score.
If you miss the deadline, the missed deadline record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may cause adverse effects on your future car buying and house buying activities.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and check whether relevant institutions have the required business license.
In the future, the trustworthy and reliable consumption financial system and continuous updating of financial products will bring more customized services to consumers and help them to improve their financial knowledge level. It will also help them to cultivate the rational consumption and moderate borrowing concept, and make them feel secure and reliable consumption partners.

The People's Daily Online - The South China Sea Cooperation Committee Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover station of the King of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, includes the countries of Aman, Al-Arab League (Aleppo), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this was the first time in 2017 that the King of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, visited Kazakhstan. This was also the first time in years that the two countries had held any kind of diplomatic ties, leading to a major crisis in the region.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt have broken off their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on its imports, accusing it of supporting terrorism and having a close relationship with Iran. Meanwhile, it has a close relationship with the United Arab Emirates.
The strained relations between China and the United States has had a negative impact on the internal cohesion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its economy.
Four Arab countries have blocked the overland, maritime and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 January meeting of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Joint Working Committee in Islamabad, when the CPEC member countries signed an agreement to ease tensions and move towards “cooperation and stability”.
Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan reopened their border.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are currently working to restore their relations with Kuwait.

It is an oil and acrylic painting on canvas, depicting a skull with a crown of thorns and a halo. The painting is part of the collection of the Brooklyn Museum in New York.
During the visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to the UAE, both sides agreed to open two coastal roads connecting the two countries.
The 725-km-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of the two countries' citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia-China Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion US dollars in the port of Aden, Yemen, and sign a memorandum of understanding worth 300 billion US dollars with Chinese companies.
The Chinese King and the Iranian President met in Tehran and discussed the implementation of the JCPOA, also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal.
Each coastal country has always considered Iran as a long-term rival and perceived Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country in the region considers the issue of Iran's missile activities to be unresolved, and has not taken any action to contain it, which is a potential danger.
In the wake of the failure of the talks between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program, Saudi Arabia and Iran began direct negotiations.
The aim is to upgrade the tense situation in the region.

The sound of people running in the New Mountains District was the loudest!
This car that our team brought for everyone is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the horse is near two hundred million, the road tax of the horse is around ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because you have the power of 700 horses, can you imagine how fast it can be?
Even the editor doesn't know, the data shows that it needs only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably faster than myvi's 30km/h speed.
The low-slung car seats, the tinted windows and the giant intakes at the corners of the car, as well as the glass-covered engine bay, perfectly capture the essence of the Lamborghini Aventador.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much. Just Google it and you'll be good to go. We've compiled some of the explanations that Google doesn't always give.
Too much studying made me go blind, so I went to watch the movie and it was really cool! (Actually it was quite enjoyable)
It costs about RM1 for 1km of petrol. (The car owner doesn't really care about it.)
The posture and strategy of driving a car should be practiced regularly, otherwise it will be awkward and difficult to get out of the car. (Because it will be hard to get out of the car if you don't practice the posture and strategy regularly)
The sound of the engine was too loud, so I had to turn down the volume of my ears after I got off the car. (But it was still very comfortable.)
The car was too big, so it had to stop at the ordinary parking lot which was very narrow, and it was afraid of being hit by the car opening the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one on the road. (This is what I said, unrelated to the driver, haha)
Don't make a mistake, this video's super fast running has nothing to do with selling. We apologize!

Allowing University Spirit and Spirit of the Times to Resonate in Unison - China News Network
The spirit of a university is to pursue a series of learning concepts and values ​​over a long period of time in the development process, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been an important driving force for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, and has been an integral part of the progress of a nation.
From the first modern university in the world, the University was born with a unique mission and spirit, different from other social organizations. For the University, it was born in the difficult time of the nation, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the values of “righteousness, harmony and peace” and “strengthening the nation”.
The trend of information and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global education competition, technology competition and human resource competition are constantly heating up. Higher education has become an important "supply side" in the face of these challenges, and the structural reform opportunities and challenges are unprecedented.
The proposal of "Integrated Development of World-Class University and World-Class Academic Disciplines" was particularly highlighted in the report, which showed the Chinese people's confidence and determination to make progress in higher education and to build world-class universities and disciplines. It also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we quickly climb to the top of the world in a short time frame, based on the existing gap between us and the world's leading universities and disciplines? How can we realize the "Fast-track Supercar"?
In addition to having faith in the target, path and ability, a college should also fully exploit three advantages: first, the post-graduation advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas scholars with advanced experience in the world's top universities, to achieve remarkable improvement in academic level and quality assurance; second, the cultural advantage, by inheriting the Chinese civilization of five thousand years of accumulation, to spread the excellent traditional culture, to integrate the strength and to create a brand; third, the institutional advantage, by fully exploiting the superiority of socialist countries' system, to strengthen the motivation of the target, to accumulate the social cohesion, to optimize the resource arrangement, to provide a solid guarantee for the rapid progress of the school.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that building a world-class university is impossible with thousands of campuses, with each school highlighting its own advantages and characteristics.
China's special feature is that it must have both a collective spirit and individual uniqueness. It must manifest its own tradition and resources to achieve its own distinctive goals and objectives.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we have been emphasizing three distinct features: first, we are dedicated to nurturing innovative and entrepreneurial talents, by constructing an integrated learning environment of school-enterprise integration and social service; second, we are pushing for the optimization of academic disciplines, to create an appropriate institutional framework for inter-disciplinary collaboration; third, we are committed to developing an international exchange and service system, to facilitate the formation of a comprehensive production-research-service system.
During this process, it is especially important to remain steadfast in the university spirit, so that the university spirit can resonate with the spirit of the times in harmony.
With regards to Zhejiang University, the core values of "seeking innovation", "hard work", "moral integrity", and "experiential learning" form a cohesive spirit that is further strengthened by the collective identity of "Navigating the River, Awakening the People, and Cultivating the Nation".
This is the school's unremitting correct implementation of study direction, constantly accumulating culture, condensing spirit and strengthening important protection. It is abundant and profound in meaning.
The spirit of openness, the pursuit of excellence, and the cultivation of integrity are the core values of a top-notch university. The University of Hong Kong strives to achieve the highest standards of truth, justice, and moral rectitude. It also seeks to foster a culture of innovation and creativity, while preserving the traditional values of hard work and respect for others. The University of Hong Kong is committed to the betterment of the nation and its people.
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit, is the soul of Zhejiang University 120 years of education.
A wise man hears the sound of silence, while a brilliant man sees the unseen.
China's higher education should further consolidate its position in the global market and shoulder the historical mission of the era. It should hasten to build a world-class university.
Simultaneously, we should guard the humanistic spirit of independence and freedom, so as to excite the university spirit and the spirit of the times, and to provide inexhaustible motive force for the realization of the national prosperity and the revival of the national spirit.

When NFT was speeding around the circle, a new concept of encryption community emerged.
In 2021, the blockchain game 'Axie Infinity' had a huge impact in the Southeast Asian region, causing some people to lose their job opportunities. However, these people have since then been able to gain a stable income by playing this game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-raising game featuring various NFT trading methods, with the highest transaction volume among all NFT projects. It has exceeded 30 billion US dollars in total transaction volume.
Data display, Axie Infinity has earned over 820 million US dollars, steadily progressing towards 'The King of Glory'.
On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 100 million.
Axie Infinity will bring a new "palytoearn" mode to more people through the help of blockchain and intelligent contracts. Players are no longer single roles, besides getting fun and economic rewards from the game, they can also participate in the game's ecological governance.
This kind of entity cannot be granted by games, but it can be guaranteed by blockchain technology.
I saw news about a friend's stock price, the greatest impact was the choice of the industry, i.e. investment in the stock market. First, it must choose a large-scale growth industry, at least 1000 billion market size; Second, it must choose a good future growth industry, considering the future 3-5 years after the industry growth reached the best state; Finally, it must choose an industry with good policy support.
The market scale is the most important factor when it comes to the width of the index finger, while the industry's development stage is the most important factor when it comes to the length of the index finger. The competitive landscape of the industry is determined by the terrain and the mountain of the industry.

The essence of martial arts is to "do the things right" and that means to do the things correctly.
Therefore, strategy is based on "doing the right thing", which is equivalent to doing the correct thing.
Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to choose the ground, in most of the tactical thinking, there is a strategic thinking space.
For example, how to increase customer number (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider whether to deepen current domain or extend to new domain (Strategic Thinking). For example, how to increase customer retention rate (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider how to improve core customer and high value customer retention rate (Strategic Thinking). In increasing activity participation rate (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider how to set correct activity KPI, achieve correct activity target, such as increasing target customer participation rate, activating inactive high value customer, calibrating new customer. For example, how to increase DAU (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.

The seller was very trustworth A new study published in the journal Nature Communications has found that the Earth's climate is more sensitive to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels than previously thought. The study, conducted by researchers from Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, found that the Earth's climate is 3-4 times more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide levels than previously thought. This means that even small changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can lead to rapid and significant changes in global temperature. The researchers used a new method to measure the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to changes in carbon dioxide levels, which they believe is more accurate than previous methods. This new method involves studying how the climate responds to changes in carbon dioxide levels over a wide range of timescales. The researchers found that the Earth's climate was more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide levels than previously thought, and that the sensitivity increased over time. This suggests that the Earth's climate is more vulnerable to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels than previously thought. The researchers hope that their findings will help improve climate models and better

The Ethnic Minority Students' Union of Yunnan Province filed a lawsuit against the Kunming University of Science and Technology for discrimination against ethnic minority students.
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice Department, protesting the discriminatory admissions processes at three universities—University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University—during the admissions process.
The Asian-American Education Alliance held a news conference in Washington D.C. on the same day to launch a petition in support of affirmative action.
The Asian American student population at three top US universities has grown exponentially over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian Americans at these universities has remained largely the same.
Research has shown that these universities in the so-called "holistic admissions" process of recruitment, "long-term and systematic discrimination of Asian applicants.
According to the research done by Zhao Yukun and others in 2014, the rate of admission of Asian applicants was the lowest among all racial and ethnic groups in these three universities.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all the schools in the Chinese American Student Recruitment Consortium, Berkeley and Dartmouth have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while UCLA and Brown have implemented race-based affirmative action for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told the reporters from the Chinese Embassy that they hoped the US Department of Education and Justice would launch an investigation and take appropriate measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asians after the fact was confirmed.
They also hoped that the school would take an active role in addressing this issue and change its recruitment policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three schools involved in the lawsuit have yet to respond.
The Asian-American Education League was established in 2015, when it filed a lawsuit against Harvard University for discrimination in its admissions process. The U.S. Education Department, however, refused to grant it.
This includes participation in the lawsuit against the United States Hua Xiang Association outside of the United States, as well as the United States Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Filipino Education Association.

In September 2020, Mr. Li from the real estate agency introduced a factory building located in Zhejiang Yunyang Town to him. After multiple visits to the site, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory building.
On the same day, Mr. Liu purchased a house and signed the property ownership rights with his family. After that, they negotiated with the seller and transferred the money through the bank. Finally, they got the house with a down payment of 20 million yuan.
Lin Xingyi signed as the collector of the deposit on the contract of the factory, where it was clearly written, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer within one week after signing the factory purchase and sale contract."
However, after both parties failed to reach an agreement on the scope of payment, the method of payment and other major terms of the contract, the signing of the contract was delayed indefinitely.
After considering for several days, Lin Ming finally returned 20 million yuan to Lu Ping.
It was quite difficult to see the house in the middle of China, but the money had been exchanged, the down payment had been made, and all the paperwork was in order. However, the buyer suddenly refused to sign the contract, which made the seller feel helpless and angry.
In order to do this, Luo Xinsheng brought a lawsuit against Liu Yongxin in the People's Court of Yucheng City.
The court held that both parties failed to sign a formal contract, so neither could be solely held responsible. It was decided to be a commercial dispute and the case should not be applied to the fixed-fee agreement. The plaintiff did not have to pay the defendant's breach of contract responsibility.
After the verdict was announced, the plaintiff raised an appeal.
The Supreme People's Court recently maintained the original verdict.

But how can we ensure that the NHS continues to provide the highest quality care for generations to come?On 24 April 2018, the NHS celebrated its 70th birthday. To mark the occasion, NHS England held a public debate to discuss the future of the NHS. The debate was chaired by BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme presenter, John Humphrys, and featured a panel of experts from the NHS, academia and industry.The panel discussed the challenges facing the NHS, such as an ageing population, rising demand for services, and the need to invest in new technologies.

After the conclusion of the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Liu Jianchao, stated on Saturday, December 11th that the United States had organized the "leadership" of the "Democracy Forum" which was "to institutionalize democracy, to weaponize democracy, to make democracy a tool of divide and conquer, to ignite civil war within the country".
The Chinese government regards the United States' long-term efforts to change its political system and value orientation to be an attempt to undermine its one-party system, destabilize the country, and foment a "color revolution".
The term'minority' has already become a'massive weapon' of interference in the internal affairs of the United States.
This time, the Belt and Road Summit is a demonstration of the commitment to the Belt and Road Initiative.
The meeting was to be held for two days and was to be conducted via video. 111 global leaders were invited, including Taiwan's leadership, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the meeting, China and Russia jointly attacked the United States, accusing the United States of lacking the qualification to host such a meeting.
There are also suspicions of ulterior motives in the international arena, such as criticism of the invitation and the organization of some authoritarian leaders, e.g. the leaders of Finland, Poland and Brazil, which have been questioned. It is suspected that the real purpose of the summit is not for democracy but for geopolitical reasons.
The German Federal Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen also attended the video conference of the People's Congress.
The statement made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, June 13, 2015, "Today's Western-style democracy is clearly visible in its money politics, personal politics, extreme polarization, political chaos, social fracturing, and racial and economic inequality," is a "rich people's game" in the United States.
During his speech, President Obama expressed, "As the leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to fortify our democracy, to advance reform, and to resist the lure of authoritarianism and the forces of intolerance."
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in each generation, in my view, this is our generation's defining challenge."
After bowing, he continued to speak, "The challenge of global democracy and human rights is a daunting one, requiring the brave to defend it."
The United States has pledged to open up a year of action after the 2020 Democratic National Convention, including a proposal of $4.244 billion in funding to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
Before the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Chinese government made a public commitment to improve its democracy system in order to ensure a successful hosting of the event.
We pledge to work tirelessly to make good on our commitments and to report back on the progress we have made by next year.

It's been so long since I last came to Xiangzhou. The fruits I plucked were still so delicious to drink and the real material was so fragrant and flavorful. The first time I tasted the fragrant and flavorful snacks from the south was like a dream come true!
The steamed buns were perfectly damp and the portion was very generous. The wrappers were crispy and the chicken skin was particularly delicious. The soup was flavorful and the vegetables were cooked just right. All in all, it was an enjoyable meal.

The fragrance of the incense is heavy and rich, with a hint of sweetness and smokiness.

This liquor can be directly mixed with ice and used for drinking, or it can be mixed with the favorite drinks to make a delicious cocktail.
The popularity of Kweichow Moutai has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and it has become a fashionable drink in China.
These sweet-tasting beverages, apart from being able to harmonize with sour and bitter flavors, can also bring visual and sensory pleasure when added to drinks, resulting in a refreshing and wine-like change in the flavor of the beverage.
The combination of Red Panda, Wild Sichuan Peppercorn, and Ginger (or Sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink Chinese tea.
The aroma of Sichuan peppercorn is slightly bitter and acidic, but when combined with sugar it will neutralize the bitterness and give the liquor a clean and refreshing fragrance. Of course, the sweetness level can be adjusted according to one's personal taste.

Thoughts on Education: How to Make University Exams Easier for "Academic Superstars" and "Cramming Superstars"The Chinese education system has long been divided into two categories: “academic superstars” and “cramming superstars”. Academic superstars are those who excel in their studies and are able to achieve high scores in their exams. On the other hand, cramming superstars are those who are able to memorize large amounts of information quickly and are able to answer questions accurately in exams.In recent years, the gap between these two types of students has become increasingly evident. This has caused a lot of debate and discussion in the Chinese education community. Some people argue that the current education system is too focused on rote memorization and cramming, and that it does not foster creativity and independent thinking. Others argue that the system is working as intended and that it is the students’ own responsibility to find the best way to study and prepare for exams.In this article, I will discuss the current education system in China and its implications for students. I will also provide some suggestions on how to make university ex
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school leadership, reflecting their frustration with the difficulty of the university entrance exam and proposing ways to make the exam more challenging, such as changing the test format and allowing it to truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
For a long time, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" in China.
At the university campus, students from five lakes and four seas come with different abilities and levels of study. The situation is varied and incomparable.
For a group with such diversity of characteristics, there will be different feelings, and it is difficult to avoid.
Of course, if the test is too simple and repetitive, the experience will be completely different.
Students who don't use their strengths may be able to surpass their opponents during the exam by focusing on their strengths, and thus achieve double the effectiveness.
When you come here, you will find yourself in a dilemma. Either you have to invest a lot of time and effort to get over it, or you can just give up and accept it. It is a tough call.
As it appears, the students of Lanzhou University who took the college entrance examination reflected the problems existing in the examination and were not limited to Lanzhou University.
From this layer of meaning, we should write a congratulatory letter to the three students who passed the examination.
In reality, many people who have passed university have become clear about how to prepare for the exam, seek various methods from teachers to "extirpate" the questions, compete to narrow the exam range, and even seek "precious guidance" during the examination. Furthermore, during the examination, some students even resort to cheating with small notes and exaggerated gestures, which is not uncommon.
As the examiner looked at the paper, it was an evaluation of teaching quality and an assessment of whether the student had passed the test. Furthermore, the examiner had a comprehensive grasp of the teacher's teaching and learning, as well as the scientific design of the test.
After entering the university, major specialization began to be divided into many specialty courses, with the basic knowledge as the main content.
Doubtlessness of basic knowledge points in a certain field, is it fully grasped in university examinations?
In essence, the knowledge of a basic science is composed of scientific principles and basic facts, which are relatively fixed.
Just like what the teacher said 20 years ago, "The basic knowledge of mathematics is still a focus now."
Although knowledge points are basic and unchanged, it does not represent the examination topic and the test questions are repeated.
At many universities, exams are usually composed of a group of questions, and then the questions are collated and put into an exam paper by a subject specialist teacher. The exam paper is then marked by a group of experienced teachers from the same subject, which can help to reduce the problem of exam paper duplication.
However, the test should be designed to cover a variety of topics related to the course, ranging from easy to difficult, in order to capture the overall progress of the student's learning. It should also take into account the dynamic changes of the test items, in order to make it challenging for easy and difficult questions, while also assessing the basic knowledge and skills of the student. In addition, the test should be innovatively designed to make it more interesting and engaging for the student.
Examinations are the commanding rod of university education, with what kind of examinations students will have corresponding preparation plans, and this will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the advice letter to the students, the Lanzhou University has highly valued and has already implemented the reform plan in the whole campus.
All educational units should organize teachers to conduct discussion and evaluation of course and examination, and formulate examination questions and related systems, while strengthening the supervision and examination of examination questions and evaluation process, and refining the evaluation results.
From the perspective of solving the problem of single-type test, duplication of topics and other issues encountered in college entrance exams, it is necessary to have corresponding systems, but the expertise is expensive and should be comprehensive, not only to digest the contents of teaching, but also to understand the students' learning situation. The two-way communication between teachers and students will be better, and the test will be more in line with the actual situation, so that "studying" and "studying" will be more balanced.

The couple had their wedding photos taken at the South Street Store. Currently, there is no store division.
Because we didn't plan the time well in advance, we had to change the time twice and the photographer was very patient with us.
After selecting a good weather weekend to take pictures.
The staff of the gold couple are all praised by the workers, regardless of whether they are consultants, beauticians or photographers.
This is my first time to do a proper makeover, wow! I'm so scared, but one day I'll look this good, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) are both superstars when it comes to makeup. They are very patient and natural when it comes to makeup.
We were lucky to have good weather when we took pictures at the scenic spot by the river. The makeup artist was always mindful of our clothes, headwear and accessories, and quickly helped us to arrange them when needed.
The photographer was also very quiet, taking pictures one day made him feel very happy.
When choosing photos for an album, due to seeing many examples online, I was reluctant to delete too many photos, but when actually choosing photos, there was no thought of adding any. We chose 24 photos and only one was missing. I was shocked when I heard that the package also included one million photos. At that time, I was both afraid and ashamed of myself. I was afraid that I had chosen too many photos. In my heart, I was also very afraid of myself.
Today, the photos were finished and Lanlan gave them to me. I looked at them and felt they weren't good enough, so they helped me to re-edit them right away.
I compared the old photos of my sisters taken before with the photos taken by me. I felt that our photos were much better than before, simple and clean. That was the style I wanted.
Recommend everyone to go and take a look at the Shrine of the Golden Man in Xuanhan!
Price of the package: 3999 yuan
Wish you all the best, with a heartfelt gratitude. May your journey be as beautiful as a piece of silk!

The truth about the Chinese military for 20 years of spilling blood and guts - China News.
This video is from the Ministry of Petroleum.
On December 11th, an oil platform named "The Killing Machine" caused a great deal of attention on the web.
This film describes how the United States waged the "anti-terror" war in Afghanistan in order to export American-style democracy, resulting in 20 years of poverty, thirst for blood, and rampant corruption and criminality.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to vandalize hospitals, schools, and other public places, warping human nature, and establishing a murderous gang.
For the past 20 years, the U.S. military has been killing countless Afghan civilians with impunity.
The U.S. military has established a "black prison" to torture and humiliate "suspected criminals".
The more people commit evil acts, the more hatred is aroused among the people of Afghanistan.
As video said, the U.S.-China conflict is becoming more and more intense.
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to Afghanistan, but only brought a lot of suffering and destruction.

Why is the warranty period of a bag with a detachable liner longer than two years, while the warranty period of a bag without a liner is only one year?
Why is the price of listening and carrying so much different?
In fact, many consumers, or even mothers' age group, believe that the quality is better than the same material.
In reality, the raw material is the same, but people think that what is expensive is good.
Even consumers with different mindsets can have different reactions and tastes after eating the same thing!
Now let's talk about the reason why we should listen to expensive things first. Where is the expensive thing?
Why are the prices of the same materials so different between them?
Because most factories consider the cost of packaging when setting prices, consumers find it hard to accept, which means that factories generate little to no profit, or even suffer losses. So what are factories supposed to do to survive?
Therefore, they were able to raise their prices on the listening post without fear of losing customers.
Therefore, most of the factories are using Listening ears instead of bags.
Advertising costs for factories each year can range from a few thousand to even billions of yuan. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine and know.
As society develops, marketing costs have been increasing continuously. For example, the advertising fees for shop staff, the rental fees for shop shelves, the gift-giving fees for products, and the advertising fees.
Therefore, each factory is constantly introducing new products, and they are all designed to be fashionable. Moreover, their prices are constantly rising due to the increasing market costs. In other words, these are the new products that have emerged as a result of the increasing market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan.

When browsing books in a bookstore, you can often feel the excitement of successive books of different genres.
Many successful books and articles today are based on the "best practices" principle — they assume you can "do it" and then tell you what to do.
Equal to say a few words about the most important and fundamental circle.
Since they all have this common trait, either they must be worked hard to reach the best outcome, or they must be worked loosely to achieve nothing, or they may be 100 or 0, or you may climb the Tai Mountain or stay at the origin loosely.
This kind of "best practice" will make everyone admit "correct without comparison" but 99% of people will be fooled and run at the starting line.
Because this kind of theory can make people suffer a lot and force them to rebuild their life from scratch, it is a very dangerous weak point for many people.
For those who adhere to the traditional rules, persist in the old habits, and reject change, you will always be at their ear whispering, "You must change." This is obviously an act of self-aggrandizement and provocation against the cattle.
Most people will hesitate before making any changes, either out of fear or due to the short-lived excitement of the moment. Some may be brave enough to take the first step, but eventually they will succumb to the hardships of the transformation and fall back into their old habits.
The famous soundtrack of "From the Unknown" from the movie "From the Unknown" was performed by Ma Sanlitun. It is a classic masterpiece that embodies the universality of human nature.
The greatest challenge of the "Best Practice" is that the door threshold is too high, which often exceeds the capacity of ordinary people's limit and makes most people "wondering and yearning".
Perhaps, “Following the Golden Rule” is one of the paths that can lead more people to success.
The core of the principle of "Less is More" is to encou The 2018-2019 school year is off to a great start! We are excited to welcome new students and families to our school community and to welcome back our returning students and families. We are looking forward to a successful and rewarding year.We would like to take this opportunity to remind our families of our expectations for student behavior. We expect all students to be respectful and courteous to their peers, teachers, and staff. We also expect students to come to school prepared to learn, with all necessary materials and supplies. We also ask that students refrain from using cell phones and other electronic devices during the school day.We look forward to working together with our families to ensure that our students have a successful and rewarding school year. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Whatever you do, it will be better than not doing anything.
Due to the decrease in the severity of the door knob, the probability of ordinary people persisting indefatigably has increased significantly, and success is likely to be enhanced as a result.
Only by following the "successful principle" can we achieve success. The road is long and winding, but it has already been traversed.
Although it is advertised as the “best principle” and appears to be successful on the surface, it is ultimately able to inspire only a few; whereas the “second best principle” can effectively inspire more people, allowing them to benefit more.

The amount of resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake will increase by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 11.8%.
The latest survey results from the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve showed that the lake's resources have increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, an increase of 40% over the 2002 protection period.
The famous "Sinking Fish" of the Qinghai Lake is a special fish species of the lake, playing an important role in the ecosystem of the lake and its surrounding wetland. It has significant effects on the water-fish-bird security and biodiversity of the lake.
During the 60s and 70s, human activities such as large-scale poaching, naked fishing, and over-fishing of water bodies had a detr Home » News » News » 2019: APC will win all elections in the country – Oshiomhole2019: APC will win all elections in the country – OshiomholeOn November 16, 2018 1:32 pmIn Newsby adekunleThe National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has said that the party will win all elections in the country in 2019.Oshiomhole made the statement on Friday in Abuja while addressing State Chairmen of the party.He said that the party was ready to win the 2019 elections and that the APC had a clear plan to achieve this.“We are going to win the 2019 elections.

In 2004, the Red List of China's Endangered Species listed the Qinghai Lake Monster as a vulnerable species.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has been implementing the ban on fishing in the lakes and rivers, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from going to Qinghai Lake and its surrounding rivers and tributaries to catch and sell raw fish or its products.
Meanwhile, we can also take measures such as increasing the flow of rivers and streams, clearing the Qinghai Lake and designing a reasonable fish passage to enhance the protection force. As the resources of Qinghai Lake are gradually increasing, the yield will be further improved.
The introduction of the artificial breeding and release of the Qinghai Lake Trout (Schizothorax platypus) in Qinghai Province has been implemented for over 1.8 million fish since 1998, resulting in a contribution rate of over 23%.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and functional area for the prevention and control of the westward desertification.
To protect the Three Gorges, Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau ecological environment, and to conserve water, wildlife and biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the Qinghai Province has been issuing warnings on the Long River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake Special Protection Areas since 2014. This has resulted in the construction of a comprehensive ban on fishing and hunting system, known as "One River, One River, One Lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I had to stuff into the bag. It was cold outside.
Do you mean that the goods are stored in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I thought I knew it all, but it turns out I was wrong. Either someone stole it from us or we let it slip away, thanks.
It has been one hour already, but still no one has left.
I just saw an article about how to write fake examples. It was too long.
Educate the unknowing male about health.
Most girls will experience their first fake orgasm between the ages of 13 and 15, and it will usually happen suddenly. By the time they are 50, they will have gone through the experience several times.
After ensuring physical health, one can compare the monthly cycle more regularly.
But it is not the law of the land to the point of accuracy, roughly one week left and right, need to prepare in advance, sometimes the mood difference will also be overturned (suddenly prepared in advance for several days).
The degree of time, pain and suffering of an individual is different, some people need three days, some people need one week; some people have little blood, some people have a big bleeding; some people have no reaction, some people need to be rescued by ambulance and the pain will change with the time, it does not necessarily represent the same person's pain.
During the 24 hours within which the full moon is visible, the vampire is unable to control itself and will continuously bleed. The only way to stop the bleeding is to wrap a piece of cloth or a handkerchief around the wound and press it tightly.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins, which begins right before your period and peaks during your period. Eating brunch can help reduce menstrual cramps, but once the cramps have started, there's nothing else that can be done.
Due to excessive release of blood and prostaglandins before menstruation, it is easy to get a painful period.
If you have reached the period, it is impossible to sneak out of the house, so you'd better stay at home for two days and wait for the month to pass.
The best time to change sanitary napkins is every three to four hours, otherwise it is easy to get a yeast infection, eliminate sleep time, the worst case is to change six times a day, seven days a month, then it is 42 pieces, plus the preparation in advance may have 50 pieces, and not every month use one piece.
(This place should be changed occasionally, but the health barrier need not be changed often. Generally, it can be changed once every five or six hours.)
During the full moon and the waning moon, the possibility of being overwhelmed by strong emotions is higher, and the mood may be unstable due to internal changes in hormones. This is very uncomfortable, and it can make you feel sluggish and exhausted.

The fluid is not only blood, but also contains endometrial tissue.
After the conclusion of the marriage, the inner membrane of the child's room became thin, and then slowly became thick. This can be understood as the child's room is a house, and each month is preparing for the arrival of guests, but there is no guest, so it is all demolished (moonlight is expelled) and then rebuilt the new house in the next month.
The monthly cycle is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with each month lasting 24 hours of bleeding and abdominal pain and cramps. Who would want to go through this?
However, people are able to be born due to their mother's hard work during the month of gestation, which is preparation for their first arrival in this world. We should all thank our mothers for their hard work and healthy pregnancy.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed by society, which told them it was immoral and shamed them. Everyone thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that preparing for pregnancy and childbirth is evil, they shouldn't say it out loud in public. Instead, the girls should stand up, they have never experienced it before and the boy won't go through it either. They should not forget their duty and be unjust.
Finally, give it a try with the health care thread, it's really useful.

Is your electricity bill too high because of your feet?
Choosing the suitable foot bath can bring you good health effects. Today, the National Beauty Small Editor will answer this question and hope to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the popularity of foot baths has grown tremendously. On the market, a wide variety of products ranging from a few dollars to thousands of dollars are available, providing consumers with a great selection space.
On related data tables, compared to traditional home appliances, the health care-related home appliances such as sauna bags have seen a rapid growth in sales, but sauna bags lack industry standards and thus have a certain safety risk.
“In the electric water, it's really dangerous!”
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his parents on their birthday, but when his parents tried to use it, they felt a burning sensation on their feet.
When Mr. Li first started using the massage chair, he didn't expect it to cause so much excitement. He was so surprised when the massage function was turned off, and he felt like his feet were stuck in a pool of hot oil. His father was even more shocked when he felt the vibrations from the massage chair.
Mr. Li tried using an electric brush, but to his surprise, the brush lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to discover that the water in the bathtub was carrying electricity.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had to give up the washing machine. Li Senior still felt uncomfortable.
Because he discovered that the old and popular foot bath that was once popular was now set at the highest temperature, applicable to any kind of people and any kind of material without any clear industry standards.
However, under normal conditions, a bathtub will not have a problem with electricity, but it also does not exclude some products during the production process did not strictly check.
Therefore, when purchasing a foot bath, choose a separate one.
Separating water and electricity, there is no safety hazard.

The 13th China Tea Expo has opened in Guangzhou - Vision Point - Hunan Daily - Huanqiu.com
On December 10th, the 13th China Tea Industry Expo and the Introduction of New Red Tea was held in the Hunan International Expo Center. The event showcased the tea industry, innovative tea technologies, and the promotion of tea culture, accelerating the growth of the tea industry.
The Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Mr. Huan Shunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress of Hunan, Ms. Yao Hong, attended the opening ceremony of the 2019 China (Hunan) International Commodity Trade Fair.

Ding Zi Liang: Zhi You Ren.
Throughout the past 30 years, I have been deeply grateful to all my friends for their kind-hearted assistance in my difficult time. In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those friends who had given me help and encouragement since 1994 when I had appealed for help to them in person or by letter. I am deeply touched by their uninterrupted assistance.
Most elderly people who encountered difficulties in life have already passed away. The lonely ones have grown up and become successful in their careers.
You have been so kind to us in our most difficult time.
The current novel coronavirus pandemic has been ravaging the world, with most donors having already exhausted their contributions.
Therefore, I humbly request you to kindly stop giving us hard time——the Mothers of the Motherland. This is a humanitarian act of rescue and assistance. It should have a perfect ending.
I will forever engrave your love in my heart and your justice will be forever etched in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my willingness in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Allow me to use this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the International Federation for China Social Services (IFCSS) and the Micronesia Development Foundation (MCDF).
During the process of engaging in people-to-people diplomacy to provide assistance, the China-U.S. Exchange Foundation and the Minnesotan Chinese Community Service Fund are parallel organizations, with their implementers often crossing paths.

Money sent to the victims of the June 4th Incident must be regular and consistent.
In 1994, Ding Guo Lao Tu suggested that a special team be established to receive and distribute donations for helping the victims of the Sichuan Earthquake.
In 1998, the MCDF established the 'Sixth Generation Fund for Chinese Orphans', which has been in operation for 11 years since then. In 2009, the MCDF then established the 'Sixth Generation Fund for Chinese Elderly in Distress', and has been continuously executing it until now.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from the alumni and the community's donations after the June 4th Incident, as well as from individual's generous donations and the support from the Democratic Party's People's Fund.
Since 2018, we have received the support of the National Natural Science Foundation for our research on labor reform.
After 31 years, the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the event.
During this period, "China People's Rights" also implemented their humanitarian projects independently.
We understand that Ding teacher called for a stop to the June 4th donation, considering the donors. We are indeed some retired people with limited income, so we express our gratitude to Ding teacher.
We will respect the decision of the hard-fought people, to terminate this project within two years, and to resume it when necessary.
For those who have been enduring great pain and suffering for many years and have bravely risked their lives to deliver help to others, we express our deep gratitude and respect.

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to receive training in a certain place. However, if you don't have the idea of ​​this aspect, it is better to self-study, because the money spent on training is too much and it takes 6 months of time to study.
If you are planning to dig your own grave in this industry, then training is the right choice, especially for those who have self-motivation and weaknesses. Training is the perfect choice.
If you are strong enough to control yourself, you can choose to study on your own. However, it will be quite tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the teacher's qualifications of this institution. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training has no meaning, of course, some new training institutions' teacher's qualifications are not particularly strong.
Before selecting this training institution, it is advisable to explore it in detail. It is important to know the students of this institution, as only they know the true nature of the institution. It is also important to understand the quality of the courses offered by the institution.
Hi, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your personal situation. Learning this thing and personal situation has very big relationship.
For example, if you are interested in a specific profession, age, or language, you may want to study or pursue a career related to it, such as in a certain city.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many online and offline training institutions that are not bad, but it requires a high investment of time and money, and you need to dedicate yourself to the training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is my case, it is very convenient to self-study. There are many free learning resources on the internet, such as videos, articles, and forums. You can also find many training resources on b station. If you can't find resources, you can contact me and get free resources or detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can still afford to pay certain tuition fees and time investments, then it is recommended to attend training centers to learn. This way of learning is not very costly and the teacher explains in great detail, with the help of people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, there is help in planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training organizations will sign a job agreement, offering both a salary and referral bonuses for successful graduates. This will greatly simplify the job hunting process afterwards.
This is my opinion, which I introduced briefly due to lack of understanding of your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime for further communication.

Strive to be the most authentic and virtuous version of yourself, walk with courage and no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a clear mind, shining brightly until old age!
Each stage of life brings its own unique challenges.
Many times, your fears were not due to lack of ability, but rather a positive attitude of facing them.
Since you cannot escape, it is better to face it directly.
The more afraid you are, the more difficult it is to overcome; if you face the difficulty boldly, the problem will eventually be defeated.

The fossil, which is believed to be the oldest human fossil ever found in Europe, was unearthed in the northern part of the country. The discovery suggests that early humans were living in Greece much earlier than previously thought.The fossil, which was discovered in the Keros cave on the island of Keros in the Cyclades, is estimated to be 50,000 years old. The fossil, which is a partial skull, is believed to be the oldest human fossil ever found in Europe. The fossil was found in a layer of volcanic ash, which suggests that the human lived during the early Holocene period.The discovery suggests that early humans were living in Greece much earlier than previously thought. According to the researchers, the fossil is evidence of a much earlier presence of humans in the region than previously believed. The researchers also noted that the discovery could help to fill in the gaps in our understanding of the early
This exhibition occupies over 12,000 square meters of space, with six interconnected buildings exhibiting : 《Smoke and Mirrors》 《Inheriting the Experiment》 《Thinking of the Edge》 《Going Public》 《Beauty of a New World》 and 《Exploring the Spirit of Art》.
Among the 27 participating artists from Saudi Arabia, works in various forms such as painting, installation, and performance art were presented. 12 Chinese artists were also featured, with some of them using innovative ways to create art from recycled materials, such as Xu Bing in his series of "Stories from the Mountains" (2014). He used discarded materials to reconstruct a classic mountain-and-water painting.
Di Liye expressed his wishes that the 2019 Expo could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain a better understanding of the cultural industry and creative community of the host country, and to strengthen mutual communication in the future.
Tian Wen Yu said: "The goal of the Two-Year Exhibition is to create a dialogue between two cultures, allowing the art of Saudi Arabia to be seen in a global context, as well as allowing the audience to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
During the Double Ninth Festival, a series of lectures will be held, inviting art masters, curators and creative industry leaders to discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Second, although the Rightists had a short-lived glory in history, it was due to the fact that they were exposed to the sunlight and drank the water. Thus, they became hot and sweaty. Later, they were defeated and crushed by the powerful forces of the state.
Although the reality is far from ideal, the right-wing has made positive contributions to the social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, we should define the true principles of socialism and set up standards for economic development, technological progress and political system reform and human rights protection. The positive meanings of the right-wing should not be denied.
Despite not completely agreeing with some of Li Weidong's views, I am very interested in them and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person. This is because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere in his views on Chinese society.
But I reject his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe revolution is inevitable, which will lead to social turmoil, people's suffering, and political instability. In other words, it is futile to expect a foreign power to intervene.
Four, changing or improving China requires patience and taking responsibility as a citizen, political gambling is not right-wing, it is a mixture of eggs.
Let's talk some more.
Left, in reality, is a remnant of the era and politics.
If the right has positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing ideas and analyze their thoughts at times of need. Then the left will have nothing to do, because the left wants to tear down the garbage that the Communist Party has thrown away.
I recently saw some of my friends looking downcast and feeling unwell. They were also feeling angry and frustrated, so I thought it was not necessary to say anything.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all a bunch of rubbish.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't want to admit that we are wrong. Why do we need to do that?
I tell my friends this way: When people insult you for five inches, when they make fun of your left leg and right dog, it proves our middle path is correct!

Even if you don't speak, the flowers are still beautiful.
For the past two years, the US has been restricting and obstructing the sales of Huawei's products, not only leading Huawei into a worse situation than ever before, but also causing immense losses to the "American-system" companies.
The U.S. imperialism has been exerting pressure on China's semiconductor industry, requiring domestic enterprises and alliance companies to simultaneously freeze the Chinese semiconductor industry, resulting in global chip supply chain disorder, and causing chip production enterprises to reduce research and development investment, reduce production and reduce chip supply chain shortage within the range.
Now "chip shortage" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price hikes, almost all industries using chips have been severely affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-governance, more and more countries' technology giants have begun to walk down the road of "beautification".
In order to tightly control the global semiconductor industry, the United States has been suppressing the development of China's semiconductor industry and recently invited 64 countries to the "Chip Summit". In addition, it has been offering subsidies to maintain its domestic semiconductor giants, such as Intel, which invested 200 million US dollars in Arizona to build two wafer fabs. It also opened up the chip foundry industry.
Most people regard this as a game, but it can cause a certain amount of impact on the Taiwan power grid and may even steal the "rice bowl" of Taiwan.
This is because Intel, the old giant of the U.S. technology, has been devoting itself to the semiconductor industry for decades and has accumulated a large number of talents and technical reserves, which must ensure its rapid rise and defeat Taiwan in a short period of time.
However, regarding Intel's decision, Taiwan's chip pioneer Zhang Zhuangmeng still did not show any regret.
At the “2021 Teacher's Cube Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Changming's speech shocked the audience. He spoke bluntly about the investment of Intel in the construction of its foundry plant, saying that Intel had built a “slave factory” and was “discriminating” against its workers.
Zhang Chunguang's determination to invade the lucrative circle of the gaming industry was fueled by his long-standing grudge against 30 years of accumulated resentment and hatred towards the company.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always at the forefront of the US semiconductor industry, occupying a position of global leadership. It was the undisputed champion of the world's emerging microelectronics industry.
In the 80s, the world's semi-conductor high-end chip was dominated by a few strong players.
During the semiconductor industry's IDM era, chip design, manufacturing and packaging were all completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this kind of pattern makes some small businesses unable to bear the heavy burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only wish and watch the huge production line construction cost.
After being attracted by the market demand in the 80s, the chip industry began to appear in the division of labor collaboration phenomenon. In 1984, Zhang Chung-Man heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Chuang's dream became a reality, and the Taipower generated electricity.
The company has been focusing on the production of jewelry processing for a long time and has not designed any products. It only provides outsourcing services for jewelry manufacturing.
When the Taiwanese were just creating their own chip industry, they were a small and insign 1. What is the difference between a will and a trust?A will is a legal document that outlines how you want your property and assets to be distributed after your death. A trust, on the other hand, is a legal arrangement that allows you to transfer ownership of your assets during your lifetime. A trust can be used to manage assets, provide for beneficiaries, and reduce estate taxes.2. What is the difference between life insurance and disability insurance?Life insurance provides a lump sum payment to your beneficiaries upon your death. Disability insurance provides a monthly benefit if you become disabled and are unable to work.3. What is the difference between an annuity and a pension?An annuity is a type of retirement account that allows you to save money for retirement and receive a regular income in retirement. A pension is an arrangement between an employer and an employee where the employer promises to pay the employee a regular income in retirement.4. What is the difference between a fixed annuity and a variable annuity?
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chuangmiao had once sought investment from Intel, but Intel was reluctant to invest in Taiwan's manufacturing ecosystem, which was too self-centered, and rejected Taiwan's manufacturing industry.
Zhang Chunguang also recognized that at that time Intel was providing no service for the graphics process.
I never thought that when I watched the documentary about the giant in the jewelry industry, I would have to start doing jewelry repairs as well.
Therefore, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when Intel entered the Jade Circle.
Today, the value of the Chinese stock market has already exceeded Intel.
Faced with the powerful attack of Taiwan's high-tech industry, Intel is also afraid to take the first step.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor has already reached 3nm chip-making, while Intel is still lingering at 14nm from 7 years ago.
Wanting to escape the reality is not easy.
He didn't wait.

Today let's take a look at some [weird] hot searches.
What is normal emotional behavior?
Randomly selecting three hot topics: the February 2nd Dragon Boat Festival, the Good-looking Price Hike, and the Crazy Shopping Event, the emotional wave spread out and finally formed a peak before [Index Down] (smooth curve). If the emotion is generated again, it will have a small rebound peak.
It looks like the emotional model displayed on the official website of the network has a great difference with the one on the network.
What is the emotion of abnormality?
Six hot spots were chosen randomly from the same event, presenting a [Mountain Peak] shape, a [Fang] shape, and a [Cliff] shape.
[Cultivation Status] Quickly heating up, it caused a lot of attention from the public; [Cyclical Heating] Ensuring the topic remained hot, it kept the topic at the forefront; [Breaking Point] It caused a mass exodus, demonstrating its full functionality, and heading to a new mission and battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the hot event is exactly the same as the valley of the other event, only a few seconds apart. It is inevitable that the united water army will be launched to the new attacking strategy.
The professionalization of the black gate is evident: dozens of hot searches at the same time, which attracts the attention of the public, which bears the responsibility of the public, which triggers the competition for advantage, which changes the perspective, which affects the judgment, which arouses the emotion, which mobilizes the action, which divides the account number into batches and segments, which is almost considered to all factors.
Transmission is a scientific field, opening up a new perspective, possessing various emotional factors, and even black box can be formed from the observational data.
Whatever paths we have taken, we must leave behind a trace of our journey. Such traces can be uncovered together.

Because of trust, I first introduced my friend. Therefore, I chose to take a look at the basic budget of 700,000 yuan for the initial stage of my house.
As soon as they entered the store, they began to pull off a series of scams.
I was the first time to the store just showed them my floor plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they still could give me the price of my 135 square feet 7 million yuan house. They probably didn't even know what brand of material they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you away and force you to give them the money. (This money is gone forever unless you have enough experience and argue with them.)
When negotiating for a car loan, they will invite their manager to tell you. If you can pay off the loan today, you will get a great discount.
This is an example of being scammed out of a lot of money. I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late.
He gave me an estimate with many problems, such as 7 million excluding water and electricity renovation, excluding any doors and closets, and this is the cost of the foundation.
Their service fee is much lower than other companies.
I lost trust in this company and didn't know what to expect. So I just signed the contract without clarifying anything.
When I went to look for them to return the money, they displayed a very experienced mannerism, with a specialized team to face you.
Regardless of how it happened, the customer's problem was unavoidable and they had no responsibility.
Responsibility for different types of refunds, as well as many details, do not want to speak all at once, it is all tears, do not choose them, because my friends found them to repair the house is not good, later you calculate different fees.
The original dragon costumes were designed to fool people, but now they have all been shut down and changed to something else.
Therefore, everyone should choose a reliable company to do the decoration of the house.
After everyone had chosen, they all looked up these answers and inquired about the cost of the renovation.

The sky is filled with stars, the constellation of the twins and the sign of the zodiac, and a raining of stars will be here on the 14th day of the great day. -Chinese News Website
On December 12th, 2019, the renowned Chinese astronomer, Professor Zhou Rucheng, gave a special introduction of the last and largest meteor shower of the year, the Twin-Zeta meteor shower, which will be arriving on the 14th of December. Meteor shower lovers can observe it after dark.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing captured a double zeta Ursa Minor cloud rainfall on December 13th, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most of the periodic comets that produce rain showers are Jupiter-family comets, but the mother of the rain showers of the double-star constellation is the 3200th asteroid of the Hent, which is an Abhore type asteroid.
The second-known meteor shower is the Zodiac Rain, which is also known as the Zodiac Rainfall. It is not the result of a comet or asteroid, but is instead believed to be the result of a planetary collision.
Dr. Peng Xin of the Tianjin Astronomical Society gave a lecture on the "Double Zeta" meteor shower, which usually appears in the last days of the year and can be seen from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is renowned for its large flow rate and stability, and is often referred to as the Beijing Meteor Shower, the Chinese Zodiac Seat Meteor Shower, and the North Hemisphere's Three Great Meteor Showers.
The most prominent feature of the Twin Star Cluster is its slow star speed, vivid colors, and abundance of fireballs, making it ideal for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tens of thousands of astronomy lovers gathered in Tianjin on December 13th, 2020 to witness the shooting of a double rainbow satellite.
The meteor shower of the year will arrive on December 14th or 15th at the exact time of the double zodiac constellation. The ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors visible at the zenith) will be 150.
Recommend a star chart for the constellation of the Twins.
Last year, the twin stars of the Zodiac sign gave people a deep impression, but this year's twin stars will be affected by the interference of the moonlight, resulting in a slightly reduced level of magnificence.
On the 14th day of the lunar month, the moon is at its full phase, shining brightly in the night sky. This can cause some interference for those trying to observe the moon, but it will become easier to observe later in the night when the moon is at its brightest. This is also the time when the double-star constellation of Ursa Minor is rising, accompanied by the radiation point of the star shower, the Geminids.
Enjoying the star shower with friends can be done after the midnight moonfall, but be aware of the cold and take measures to keep warm.
How can we observe more stars efficiently?
It is not advisable to conduct observations in urban areas, but one can choose to observe from a mountain, a valley, or a rural area facing east, and wait patiently until the moon falls before conducting the observation.
The important thing to note is that the flow of rainfall towards each direction from the Double Star is very large. When observing, one does not need to constantly fixate on the Double Star's radiation point.
Friends who love taking pictures should consider taking pictures of beautiful stars and rain drops with a wide angle lens and a high ISO setting.

What differences exist between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional TV that the host mentioned should be referring to liquid crystal TV, while the difference between plasma TV and liquid crystal TV lies in their positions in the market, mainly in two aspects: price and image quality.
The first one is laser TV, focusing on the large-screen market.
Compared to the liquid crystal television market, the laser television market is more focused, as laser television is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream liquid crystal television size is between 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally above 75 inches, with the maximum exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the global demand and sales of laser TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for over 60% of the total 80-inch plus TV market.
According to the prediction of the Chinese market, the growth of the laser television market in 20
The reason why we have achieved such good results at the Shanghai Market is due to the excellent performance of our laser TV in the protection eyewear department.
Based on the principle of laser television imaging, the light from the laser source is reflected instead of directly entering the eye. Compared to the backlight of a liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Shanghai Institute of Standardization and Quality Control, in collaboration with the Beijing Ophthalmology Hospital, conducted a strict comparison experiment of viewing liquid crystal and gas laser televisions under the same conditions, resulting in 144 data sets.
Data Verification: Laser TVs possess very strong eye protection features, even in certain aspects exhibiting certain improvement.
As the importance of eye health has been increasingly recognized, laser eye surgery has been drawing more and more users, taking advantage of its unique benefits. In this context, the popularity of laser eye surgery has been growing exponentially.
The second generation of laser TVs will focus on the high-end market.
Exploring the prices of liquid crystal televisions is an ongoing process, with prices currently ranging from thousands of yuan to above. As the size and light source of the televisions improve, the prices have been gradually rising.
What is the price of this expensive laser TV?
Ken is rational.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
By taking advantage of the advanced technology of laser projection, the distance between the projector and the screen can be greatly shortened, allowing for a 100-inch experience within a short distance. The space required is small, and the host is small and compact.
On the brightness aspect, a leading brand LED TV can reach above 2000 nits.
Adding a little bit of heat will reduce the amount of energy consumed, which in turn reduces the wear and tear on equipment and extends the lifespan of the television.
Besides this, there are many high-end laser TV models that have also equipped with 4K Ultra High Definition picture quality, Artificial Intelligence system, and Imitation Glass screen, which can bring users a more vivid and immersive audio-visual experience.
Talking about the fake demand instead of the detailed product, discussing the quality and investment of the product, the laser TV is not the game player's snack, considering the large screen and watching environment, you can try, there are both advantages and disadvantages, and then judge for yourself.
It's simple to say, but the wide-angle lens is quite close to the screen, so it has to be used at a high price. The wide-angle lens and the reflector are not in line with the best optical design.
To block part of the environment light, using the fabric of Fengshui, the price is too expensive, 80 cm wide, the price can be exchanged for 65 cm of liquid crystal.
There is still one thing I particularly detest, and that is when people try to sell me those reflective mirrors that are supposed to be put on the eye-glasses to make them look cool. Do not buy them, they are just a waste of money and they do not work.
Moreover, if the projection screen curtain is not a dream, it will be impossible to finish.
The hot spot (glare) effect of the blind was ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from one corner, making it difficult to bear.
The store is specialized in photography and video equipment. It is currently looking for quality products.
After adding a date to my WeChat appointment, my girlfriend quickly arranged the available time and replied the message promptly.
Before I went into the store, I had a look at the photos taken inside. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The shooting style involved was also diverse.
After having conversed with my little sister in a simple manner, I was very patient and persistent in helping her try on two different outfits, until we finally settled on the perfect look. The photographer then set up the scene, giving directions and carefully guiding each movement. He also paid attention to the details, striving for perfection.
Although I didn't have a specific shooting idea in mind, the photos I took weren't the style I wanted, but they still looked good.
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, and have a chance to communicate with the model. It felt like the photographer was very attentive to details.
The effect of the makeover is about half a month, and it's worth it.
The King of Photography Shoot was a great success! Everyone was able to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed in.
After trying on several different outfits, she finally chose a black fitted dress, experien The 2019-2020 school year is off to a great start! We are excited to be back in the classroom and to see our students grow and learn throughout the year. We have already had some great experiences, including our annual field trip to the pumpkin patch and our first family fun night. We look forward to many more fun activities and learning experiences this year.We are also excited to announce that our school is now a 1:1 iPad school. This means that each student will have their own iPad to use in the classroom. This will enable us to provide more engaging and interactive learning experiences. We are also looking forward to using the iPads to enhance our STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) curriculum.We are also excited to announce that we have a new principal, Mrs. Heather Keller. Mrs. Keller has been an educator for over 20 years and is passionate about helping students reach their potential. She is looking forward to getting to know our students and families and is excited to be part
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer is a younger brother of 95, and he feels slightly more experienced but still a bit green. He hopes to give more advice in the future after more shooting experiences. The shooting process was quite enjoyable.
The store specializes in photography and provides high-quality products.
I have visited the homepage, so I have come to look at Queenie~
First, fill in your name, phone number, and choose clothing. You can choose a wedding dress, too. After that, you can choose three or four sets of clothing and they are very patient. Finally, you can take a long time to get dressed and the service attitude is good. After that, the photographer will teach you how to pose and it looks like the original picture. It seems to take half a month, and then you will receive it. It feels like the original picture.
The environment is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
The makeup spot is not far away, there is a photography backdrop inside.
[Service] Very hot and very attentive.
The tutor is patient and has a strong sense of resilience.
The photographer will also be very attentive in teaching you the movements.
The photographer will also propose retouching if you are not satisfied.

Eyebrows were also shaved off, which made me feel a bit awkward for everyday without eyebrows.
The picture was taken after 10 minutes, but the result of the P-picture was not satisfactory. It felt like there were too many layers of eye makeup on.
Because it was not too clear what style to choose, she tried two sets. Eventually, she chose the black formal dress.
After choosing the clothes, the makeover process could begin. The fashion stylist and the makeup artist were super patient and worked hard to get the desired result. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
After getting dressed and doing makeup, the photographer then started to take pictures. Throughout the whole process, the photographer had full control of my poses and movements, which made it very easy and relaxed.
After finishing the movie, my brother said he liked the four most. He was so excited when the ending was very touching.
It has been 3 days since I have not received a reply... Due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee!
The strangest thing was that I always used the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay shipping fee every time.
Can I pay my monthly fee in installments? After you finish the investigation, can I pay the remaining fee?
Should I buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small umbrella is a platform of insurance and financial services over the internet.
According to the regulations of Insurance Regulatory Authority, to become a insurance intermediary company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, founding person and recent 3 years without serious law violation, with a minimum capital of 5 million yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Authority.
This three-tiered system is actually quite complex, summarized as requiring strength and perseverance, needing to go through the state authority's approval and having a good investment attitude, being a small umbrella for insurance, and not needing to worry too much about it. In short, it is a legal and legitimate insurance policy.
At this point, it's still not bad, it's worth believing in.
From insurance products, we can see that Small Rain Umbrella Insurance is a kind of insurance marketplace, where many companies' star products are being sold, such as the latest Superstar and Thai Superstar 5th edition products, with the guarantee of both parties being insured and the insurance company being responsible for the insured. Small Rain Umbrella Insurance is only a mediator, without any doubt of its trustworthiness.
From the perspective of cost: Internet platforms, due to the absence of operating costs such as rent and labor costs, have higher prices than traditional products, and the cost of subscription is flexible, reducing the burden of monthly payments, and minimizing the risk of insurance companies. At the same time, it can maximize the potential of insurance products.
This point is still very good.
You can consider it.
From the perspective of professionals: This point is particularly important, because the insurance industry requires a very high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health insurance and professional fields. In health insurance disclosure and professionalism, non-insurance professionals are likely to add their own subjective opinions, which can easily lead to misrepresentation and other risks of being denied.
I have done insurance sales over the phone for "Tencent Weibo" (the same as Little Umbrella, it is an internet insurance platform). I am very responsible for telling everyone this.
Insurance on the Internet is real, but it's risky. Unprofessional people abound on the Internet, but there are also many scams.
For example, insurance companies offer insurance policies with a premium of 1 yuan, which can protect 600 million yuan. Buy insurance and get a free mobile phone, and there is no wrong marketing strategy, but it is not worth the risk of being light and not telling the insurance company. The first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is the same as the normal fee. After 200 times, many customers do not know what is wrong.
I can buy a flower with 1 block of gold, and the insurance company will pay 600 million (the whole world is bankrupt).
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666, 8888, etc. These numbers are only sent out when there is a prize draw and you don't exchange it for anything. Furthermore, no one will remind you if there is a prize draw.
(This is for people who are investing in insurance. It's just another hole in the ground.) Free insurance of 6 million yuan, it is short-term, if only relying on this, without other commercial risks, million-dollar disaster, 6 million can not solve the problem, the life afterward began to run.
At present, the country is also vigorously combating the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, we should look at the platform, product and business from all angles, and the problem lies in the professionalism and work ethics of the staff.
Recommendations for clients should be considered carefully, as there are many insurance and financial products available from reputable companies. Clients have a wider choice of products and better value for money than with online products.
I have helped 59 online customers, guaranteeing the product line and saving up to 2000-3000 RMB per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an experienced insurance broker with over 3 years of business management training and customer service experience. I have worked with over 100 insurance companies and served more than 1000 businesses. Before proposing a policy, I will carefully assess customer needs and tailor a suitable insurance product. During the policy period, I will strive to secure the best coverage for the customer and make sure all the paperwork is in order. After the policy is in place, I will handle all the paperwork and make sure the customer is worry-free.
Grow with each client for life long success.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, online insurance is the process of clicking on the insurance link and completing all the insurance procedures independently.
During this process, no signature is required from the insured or the insurance advisor, and all steps can be completed by the insured without any signature.
Although there is no "ceremony feeling" in online insurance, even the paper contracts of printing out the agreement may not exist, it will not affect the validity and legality of the electronic contracts.
This kind of pattern is similar to a typical telephone sales job, but when it comes to buying insurance, it could be a potentially fatal problem, as the subsequent service may not meet expectations.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that spans over several decades. When purchasing insurance, should we carefully consider and reflect upon it? Our chosen “intermediary” (i.e. insurance agent) should be one that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even after many years.
How can I contact the delivery staff?
I have already finished the task in 3 minutes.
Is it supposed to give me compensation?
I said I want to open the door and send the goods.
But that guy just gave it to the gatekeeper, and then people just left.
The gift was wrong.
Your hands have already taken my one piece of overseas sale, but still waiting for it.
My order has been received at 19:25, but they are still reluctant to ship out.
I have bought everything, do I need to go shopping elsewhere?
How do I do it?
Your horse has gone to where?
Do you still need to wait?
I am sending a bill.
Good, you didn't cancel, so I called the police.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of discrimination and ridicule, and cannot accept any form of physical or verbal attack.
In the civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't see the political party and factionalism, you must suppress it first, which is an uncivilized wind.
From you I started to send friend requests, then I wrote a flirty post on the wall, and finally I tried to publish your home address and father's name on social media. I have already taken an unresponsive attitude.
After you tagged me, you continued to talk about me behind my back in a malicious and insidious manner. You discussed my embarrassing and humiliating thoughts, facial features, body, and even my bedroom habits. You even went as far as to talk about my petty and insignificant actions. I'm...done.
After I sent you the picture, I received many messages from your friends, including some related to your face, some harassing comments, and some humorous remarks.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After you have downloaded the news about my reporting the police, you have become more and more addicted, instead of being relieved.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your identity is, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
You can continue this kind of flirtatious, coquettish, apologizing, humiliating, ridiculing, insulting, harassing language, you can also continue to say that you only love and care about me, you can even continue to think that it is not harassing, you can even continue to deny that it is not your own picture or continue to post all kinds of attacking speech.
I can't stop you.
Even though I don't recognize you, I don't want to recognize you. My appearance and physique do not need your evaluation and criticism.
I was so ashamed that I felt like no one else would want to help me.
My friend asked me, is it still good?
I said hello, you also will not believe.
I think no one can be treated so badly that they can't still say they're okay.
Regardless of whether it is at work, society, politics or business, only those people who lack basic human decency will choose to use this method to hurt any woman.
I believe, integrity is inherent in human nature.
I have cut some of the comments and sent them to everyone for review.
Your own post should not be copied by others.
You are the enemy of civilization.
Laugh out loud.
The People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum.
During the Third China National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss topics such as digital technology industry and national digitalization transformation, digital technology industry and the novel coronavirus outbreak, and the economic recovery and development after the outbreak.
The Vice Chairman of the Communications and Media Committee, Rong Mengxuan, expressed that although the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the number of Vietnamese digital technology companies to decrease and their business income to drop, the growth potential of the industry is still promising, with an estimated growth rate of around 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has been striving to develop digital products and solve the major challenges facing the country. Many digital products have already left the country and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Yuan Meng Xiong was elected as the Chairman of the Digital Technology Industry Association and called on the government to provide support for the development of digital transformation platforms. Taking on the task of developing these countries' digital platforms is the responsibility of the state.
On the forum, various departments and government agencies are leading the way in studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology. Companies, organizations, and individuals have been sharing their experiences and resources to promote the development of the digital economy in Vietnam, and have been actively pushing for the digital transformation of the country.

People and enterprises are the core, body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be aimed at benefiting the people and enterprises.
The Premier emphasized the importance of digital transformation, which should manifest the spirit of the nation, rely on internal strength, strategic thinking, long-term planning and decisive factors. External force should be treated as important and breakthroughs should be achieved.
He believed that digital transformation should be driven towards in-depth development and sustainable development, such as participating in the novel coronavirus epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery and development, responding to the aftermath changes, and overcoming the natural resource depletion phenomenon, to promote green transformation and green energy development.

Following the recent plunge of Meta, its market value has been evaporated by 2510 million US dollars, and Buckingham responded to the "unprecedented competition" it faced. What is the reason for this?
Meta（Original Facebook）is a advertising company mainly earning from ads, a company that makes money from ads today. It has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. - regardless of what type of function it is, it is all a flow channel of Meta.
Not only this, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many Apps connecting to it through its advertising platform, thus achieving transformation.
However, times have changed.
Due to the adjustment of the privacy policy of Apple, it is difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertisement spending.
Apple's privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will be very obvious to users whether they allow the app to get their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google further sharpens its sword and cuts into the Meta's income, the impact will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor weakened in the Meta's income growth before (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of the company's income comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies' contributions to the maritime industry.
There are about 100 people in the office of Meta in Hong Kong, and there are several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is the most popular advertising platform for them. Spending a lot of money on it.
One of the major competitors of TT is Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from the Chinese market.
Agents from all over China have been helping each other to promote their businesses on the Chinese social media platform, Weibo. The performance of the Chinese region on Weibo has been very successful.
I haven't been specializing in it recently, but I'm sure it will be better than before.
The stage of China's large-scale overseas money-making has already passed.
The third, the new flow channel expansion is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, but the new platform including TT is not in the Meta hand.
The biggest problem is not only a decrease in income, but also a lack of growth expectation.
Not only do we need to look at current income from the capital market, but it is also important to consider our expectations for the future.
It was very obvious that the expectations of Meta were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zack Brown talked about “The Universe”.
The universe is the direction of the future, but its implementation period is relatively long, and this story should not be able to support the value of Meta in three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be more difficult than ever for Meta.
Don't look at the face of the book now, it is very dangerous. Every year, there is 1,000 million to 2,000 million US dollars of income, but the real sense of danger is very strong, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies. There is no good security of the castle river.
Although his social media presence is currently higher than ever, it is still a mainstream social media platform, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of TikTok, it has no confidence, and it is a stealthy skill.
Translating the concept of the universe into a short period of time is impossible, so there is no hope of success, so the risk of facebooks is very dangerous, this is why Zuckenberg changed the name of the company and always looking for new tracks. However, I think his decision is wrong, it is a wrong path.

The Chinese and Vietnamese armies concluded their joint peacekeeping and rescue exercise “Peaceful Rescue 2021” on the New China News website.
On December 12th, 2020, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) jointly held the "Peacekeeping and Rescue - 2021" exercise in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The Chinese PLA contingent all returned safely to the mainland of China after the 7-day exercise.
This joint performance was a great challenge to the people's democratic medical rescue mission. We had to work hard and stay vigilant to ensure the success of the mission. We had to take effective measures to rescue the injured, treat the wounded, and provide medical aid to the people in need. We also had to establish a unified command and control system, unified rescue and relief system, and standardized medical treatment system to ensure the success of the mission. This enhanced the joint rescue and relief capabilities of the two armies.
After practicing hard, I was able to obtain the approval of the two armies.
The Vice Chairman of the Exercise Instruction and Guidance Committee of the People's Army of Vietnam, Long Van Xuan, spoke at the conclusion of the exercise, saying that through this exercise, the Vietnamese military doctors learned the knowledge of the exercise organization and professional activities from the Chinese side. They also saw the medical and safety equipment of the Chinese side.
The results of the exercise proved the professional capabilities of the Chinese and U.S. military medical forces in the areas of medical assistance, epidemic prevention and control.
The Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Wang Hongguang, expressed that this exercise was a continuation of the successful organization of the Joint Medical Exercise in 2018, which was a great opportunity to explore new ideas and practices. He believed that this exercise had great significance.
During the period of military training, the People's Liberation Army of China donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the people of Vietnam.
