I'm so bored that I'm watching TV.
What happened to the miko when she went to the TV?
Yesterday I was watching Netflix in Chirori, but it was so boring that even the staff started laughing at the funny scenes.
This is not funny, no matter where you are.
Even though the staff didn't laugh, the artist's bad attitude made the workplace unpleasant.
She was a part of that old black company, but now she's just a regular person who hates the attitude of some artists.
That person is talking about how "artists are ruining things" non-stop. What is she talking about?
It's hard to make a living, but it's even harder to be an artist, since the job is so mundane and repetitive.
There is a lack of awareness of the need to legitimize the presence of comedians and entertainers in the media and society.

She exchanged the products she had ordered at the convenience store without her knowledge.
Instruction: You ordered a wireless mouse and it arrived, but the wireless version was expected. If you want a refund, it was said to be returned.
Despite the notoriety of self-built PCs, it is impossible to obtain knowledge without considering the trouble.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse from MSI was on sale for 3,280 yen (link to Gintama) at the start of the Gold Week sale.
Since the same price was found for both the wired and wireless versions, the possibility of a value-for-money misconception was considered and the wireless page was confirmed as well, resulting in the order of 5,071 yen.
Normal order emails arrived and the next day shipment emails as well.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 Lightweight Wireless" can be found in both the purchase history of the two emails and the page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order until the wired mouse arrived, it was assumed that the order had been shipped from the moment the order was placed.
There was a problem with the registration of the product after she had already left the store.
According to that email...
The wireless version was supposed to be sold at a discount, but in reality it was the same as the regular version.
They have already shipped the wireless mouse, so it must be included in their cargo.
We refused to cancel all reservations.
You can return a mouse only for a refund.
Use a wireless mouse.
We chose to respond to it.
When you purchased the product, it was sent to you with the wireless version, even though the product page for the wireless and wired versions were different.
You were sent something different from what you bought, but you returned it without understanding. Is it too difficult to return it from here?
Please lend us your wisdom since you're so eager to retaliate and return the favor.

Isolated again...The only bridge leading out of the town was washed away by the typhoon and flooding, so the residents had to buy three times as much supplies. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Matsumoto Store in Fukushima Prefecture's Kawamata Town.
The devastating impact of the 2019 East Japan Typhoon was particularly felt in the 3rd quarter of the year.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It was a magical feeling."
This bridge was the only way through the mountainous region. It was washed away by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, leaving the 30 people of the 11th generation of the region in a solitary state.
The strong-willed residents had to carry necessary supplies over the forbidden JR bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "If it's not raining, the car will come to the garden. If it's raining, you can take the car down by the stairs and hold it with your hands or put it on the back of a bicycle and ride the bicycle over the temporary bridge. It takes about three days to become stranded in this way." One month after the emergency bridge was completed, it was washed away by a three-month downpour and became stranded in this way for several days.
Although Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing his efforts to recover from the disaster for two years, he has been taking various measures such as giving advice.
Masamune Shirow, creator of Ghost in the Shell, thinks there are about 10 cases of it.
We should ensure that people have enough to eat for two to three days. Canned goods and instant noodles, for example, can be used for emergency food.
Ms. Matsuko San said, "I don't know when the disaster will strike, but I'm preparing for it by stocking up on supplies and hoping for the best." Meanwhile, Shimizu Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" which had never been imagined before.
The town has started its own unique take on the lessons since 2021.
The town of Kagami is planning to hold a special day to prepare for disasters in the future, on October 12th. The education chief, Takashi Kagami, says it's a good idea and hopes to make it an annual event.
I have become more aware of the potential for unforeseen events.

When buying a used home, beware!
The Falling Hole in the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
The newly established "Building Condition Survey System" is expected to boost the activity of the used housing market.
The price of construction and the demand for renovation are both increasing, with the priority of sale processes for housing rising in tandem.
Meanwhile, the popularity of words such as "station", "nearby", and "direct connection" has decreased significantly, leading to a decrease in the construction of new buildings.
Despite the fact that the existing (used) housing share in Japan is still relatively low compared to overseas, it has been steadily increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) began a survey in 2018 to inspect buildings for safety and security, with the aim of regulating the transaction of used homes.
This is a system designed to allow a builder to check the condition of a property and present it to potential buyers, including the condition of deterioration.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers due to the introduction of inspections.
The merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning up after the delivery by performing a thorough inspection of the item beforehand. This provides the buyer with a sense of security.
This discrimination is due to the competitive nature of the events.
On the other hand, it is possible to understand the condition of the used house you are going to buy in advance, and it is beneficial to be able to purchase it quickly.
On the system of the current building inspection, the seller is mainly responsible for the guidance right.
It is important to pay attention to the fact that the notification of the inspection system has become obligatory at the same time.
In short, a real estate agent who is responsible for introducing a construction expert for the property should explain the duty of "introducing a construction expert for the property" but not actually obligated to implement it.
● Inspection of used car dealers is a risk that is already being experienced in Japan. However, in foreign markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where used cars are actively traded, similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stages of buying or selling a home, the buyer typically requests a specialist such as an inspector or building surveyor to conduct a building inspection.
In the United States, home inspections are typically conducted at a rate of 70-90% in the secondary market.
The main difference between a "seller-led" inspection and a "buyer-led" inspection is that the former is led by the seller, while the latter is led by the buyer.
The landlord is expected to maintain the condition of the building to a reasonable standard, but can charge the tenant for any repairs that are necessary.
The landlord is thought to be considering the survey content carefully and performing the necessary repairs and maintenance to make it a pleasant place to live.
Even if they have the same intention and thought, she is not leading him astray.
Therefore, the following points are highlighted as potential risks for the Japanese system: 1. Lack of transparency 2. Complexity 3. Slow decision-making 4. Dependence on external actors 5. Unpredictability 6. Potential for capture by vested interests.
This country's retailers must adhere to the minimum standards set by the government when it comes to inspections.
For inspection companies, there is a risk of missing important defects if they don't conduct thorough investigations.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted in which the seller is made to feel uncomfortable for not reporting any unfavorable survey results to the customer.

You can expose a bit of trivia in Ginza.
Introducing the fascinating knowledge of the Silver Spoon restaurant in Ginza.
What's going on in the sky above the Ginza?
He made his first foray into the gold market.
As you walk down Silver Street, you can see the changing names of places, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shops that have been left behind.
She walked to Ginza, feeling a sense of nostalgia.
Was Ginza a suburb of Tokyo?
The phrase "Ginza" has become a synonym for bustling shopping and dining scenes in various cities in Japan, such as Tokyo's Ginza district.
In 1612 (Kan'ei 17), the Silver Coin Forge in Edo was relocated from the current city of Shizuoka.
At the time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but when it moved to Ginza, it became known as "Ginza".
Tokyo Bay is known as the "Halves Island" which was thrust out from the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the woman would enter the man from behind, and the woman's back would be the "Edo Before Island".
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Financial District of Tokyo.
Tokugawa Ieyasu began the construction of Edo Castle and filled in the moat, leading to the development of the Kyobashi district.
We will further improve public health and develop water transportation by strengthening the digging of canals.
They dug a hole, filled it with earth from the ruins of the castle and Mount Inari, and built a shrine there.
In front of the store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) indicating the site of the former Ginza Chuo Ward Office, so those interested in exploring can go and take a look.
People know the Tokyo's Ginza district as a sacred place.
Every year, the "Silver Temple" pilgrimage is held in the Ginza district.
This shrine is the most popular tourist destination in the area. It is located in front of the famous Kabuki Theater.
On the right side of the stage at the Kabuki theater, there are fewer people coming to watch plays before and after the show.
One side, the "Lion King" is on the roof of the Ginza Matsuya, the "Ginza Dating Site" is on the 9th floor of the Ginza Sante.
The shrines "宝童稲荷神社" and "あづま稲荷神社" and "豊岩稲荷神社" are located in the depths of the road, but the latter is known to have been respectfully built by the geisha of the "豊岩稲荷神社" in the past. The "成功稲荷神社" located in the basement of the "Binza" building is not open to the public, except for the time when it was part of the "八丁神社" route.
This shrine is filled with many places to worship the kami, but few shrines worship the kagura.
The fox greeted the people at the entrance of the Shinto shrine, which is a place where many farmers gather to offer prayers for a bountiful harvest. Thus, it was constructed with the hope of gaining the benefit of a plentiful crop.
This shift has resulted in an increase in commercial activity, as well as a widening of religious diversity in Tokyo and other large cities in Japan, such as Kyoto and Edogawa.

That pain in the knee, if it were to happen, would be "Chondromalacia Patellae"!?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC - Yahoo! News)
The Editing Department: The pain in my knee has been persisting recently.
What kind of illnesses are possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of knee pain is varied, such as overuse, ligament and joint injuries, and inflammation.
In that area, "shape-shifting joint disease" is very common among the Japanese.
Is it possible that the joints will become deformed due to editing?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
In reality, the surface of the joints are covered with a soft tissue, allowing for the absorption of impact and the smooth movement of the joints.
As we age, overeating, and strenuous exercise can lead to softening of the bones and misalignment of the joints.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformities and inflammatory diseases.
Editorial Board: Is it true that morphological dysplasia can also occur outside the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
You may experience pain in other parts of the body, such as the knee, wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, ankle, and heel.
However, the most common case is "scoliosis", which is an abnormal curvature of the spine.
What kind of structure has the editing department become?
Professor Marunan: The joints are made up of two bones that are slightly misaligned to each other.
Then, the portion covered by the two books is "joint cushion" and the surrounding area is "joint wrap".
Editing Department: It's complicated, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
This organ is called smooth muscle and it secretes the synovial fluid in the inner layer of the capsule.
This joint fluid is composed of lubricants such as hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that Hyaluronic Acid and Condroitin Sulfate are good for smoothly moving the knee.
What kind of symptoms do people with Scoliosis suffer from?
Professor Maruyama: There are two important roles of the ligaments: to provide stability and to absorb shock. The ligaments do not attach directly to the bones, so they are responsible for taking the brunt of the force.
Iwaba is playing the role of a maid in a cafe.
Unfortunately, this can cause joint deformities, inflammation, and pain.

The trap-filled Pachinko character "Nu" appeared in the movie "Pachinko Breaking Bad Record".
In the original work, it was shocked by the high rate of 1 ball at 4000 yen.
This trap was almost impossible to bypass in the "sludge" - it was guarded by a huge trap in the "Mine of Blades" which was a movable object and had three stages of the curtain.
He employed every possible means to topple the giant, from pouring water from a barrel of vinegar to setting up a cement foundation.
The character "Nemo" from the movie Finding Nemo has become popular as a playmate for many people.

The debtors were running as fast as they could while carefully avoiding the thin steel bars installed atop the ground 10 meters above, and competing for speed.
12 people participated, but since the steel rope was only four meters long, the safety measures were insufficient and the death possibility was quite high.
This bridge is very dangerous, but it is also possible to have an extremely close experience by playing the VR game. It was installed at the "Rakuten Life Park Kagoshima" as the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Ieguchi Bridge".
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors above ground), with a steel bridge at the end, and a "Victory Bridge" and a "Skywalk" leading to it. People can walk there.
Of course, safety measures are in place.

She took a beautiful picture of the Tori at the Shinto Shrine.
At the Shinto shrine in Shimane City, a giant picture of the god of harvest, "Torri" (留り), appeared as part of the preparations for the new year.
The Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed the altar went to the shrine on November 11th and performed a ritual of offering at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting original drawings of horses from apprentice craftsmen since last year.
Nine people from the Art Course of Japan Painting taught by Prof. Mitsunori Aoki participated in the drawing. 3 years later, Tsuchiya Yui's (22) work was employed.

Thinking about Proposals Workshop for 4 High School Students in Yamaguchi: San Diego News Digital
What kind of town was 2030's Yamanaka?
The student representatives of the four high schools in Tama City are discussing the future of "Tama" in a workshop with a consensus.
This organization is aiming to present the voices of young people to the mayors, as part of their survey and policy proposals.
What is fun at any time?
When the student was asked questions by the faculty, he answered such questions as "When will the work be done?" and "Why are you talking so much?"
The first ever event was held at the Sunshine Aichi Convention Center on November 13th.
The 18 high school students and local people discussed the themes of "an interesting town", "an easy-to-live town" and "a town that makes you feel alive" while moving the island using the techniques of a "World Cafe".
Each person's thoughts were written on separate pieces of paper and organized by attaching them to the corresponding person's origami.
A town with many young people is lively and interesting, but it lacks the convenience of transportation such as trains and buses.
There's nothing else to talk about, let's just keep talking.
Tama-no-sho-gakusei (18) had never imagined that cycling along the coast would be so amazing.
The third-year student at Higashi High School (18) said, "The store is scarce, but the traffic is inconvenient, yet the natural abundance is beautiful," and started talking with the adults, not only about the regional issues, but also about the charm.
The second meeting in December was only for high school students. They organized the contents of their proposals.
The mayor is expected to announce a plan to invite the education chief and the mayor in February.
The president of the same center is talking about "if young people can become involved in the local community in a meaningful way".
An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.0 occurred in Shimotsuma, Ibaraki Prefecture (co-located with the Yahoo! News feed).
At 12:31 pm on November 12th, a magnitude 4 earthquake hit the prefectures of Chiba, Tokyo, Saitama, and Yamanashi.
According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter of the earthquake was in the south of Miyagi Prefecture, with a depth of around 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be M5.0.
This tsunami will not cause any concern.
The intensity of earthquakes varies by location.

Our findings suggest that this new approach to storage could be beneficial.

She had expected to find a new store, but instead found an old one.
The store of the brand "Cotto" is compact in size, with a length of around 1 meter.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be that short and twisty?"
When you look closely, you can see that the fabric has been carefully cut and sewn into one piece, with a net-like pattern. The entire piece is made of fine, evenly cut and sewn fabric, with a net-like pattern.
The end of the store is coming through the net.
Although you cannot join them without sewing them together, you can wrap them around each other.
This material is very light and warm.
This year, the popular jersey (best) is combined with a jacket to stay warm, but people are combining it with a coat to stay warm as well.

The Beatles' documentary at Disneyland is super interesting.
Despite its title, the movie Get Buck was directed by Peter Jackson.
These Beatles were created for people to feel the hardships of life.
Even though the scattering was about to happen, the characters still had a dramatic and tense conversation.
While working hard, Paul said, "I can finally understand it!" He then continued, "But it's still quite tiring!" He then sighed and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then shook his head and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then laughed and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then shook his head and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then laughed and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then shook his head and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then laughed and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then shook his head and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then laughed and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then shook his head and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then laughed and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself!" He then shook his head and said, "It's like I'm talking to myself
It's so irritating when people are arguing and being unproductive, but the atmosphere is so tense that it's almost funny - like when Beatles fans get into a heated argument about which one is the best.
Everyone really shines in that kind of atmosphere.
My friend and I were talking about a phrase we heard, but it was too complicated for us to understand. We decided to look up the song it was from and listen to it together to get a better understanding.
This is a great moment to get Buck.
The beautiful, whistle-y song slowly grows louder and louder, and the scene is magical.
That woman is amazing.
After that, she just watched the performance and became happy.
Although it was only one chapter of three, it was still very interesting. The greatest cause of the breakup was the atmosphere around Beatles's "Hey Jude" - a song about the dissolution of a relationship.
After they had finished composing the song, they were filled with joy and began to look for a suitable location for the live. However, no one knew what to do. Then, the promoters and the publicists started to shout, "The Beatles are coming from all over the world!" and they were amazed by the greatness of the song.
It's not clear what she was thinking, but she was clearly captivated by Peter Jackson's video.
I thought there were many Paul-like antagonists in the story.

In America, a severe weather system is bringing a mix of rain, snow, and strong cold temperatures (Weather News - Yahoo! News)
It took place over a 10-day period from Friday night to Saturday night, with the American South as its center.
It is noted that the strong cold air has rapidly developed southward, leading to unstable weather conditions, and the air has become very unstable. Furthermore, it has caused the development of strong convective clouds, which have advanced rapidly.
A record-breaking heatwave from the southwest has swept across the south of America, bringing temperatures not seen in decades.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to reach 30°C near the end of the week.
In this record-breaking warmth, a strong cold front rapidly developed into a well-defined line of storms moving southward.
It is believed that dragonflies are beginning to appear in the neighborhood.
The southern United States is an area where hurricanes often occur, but there are few cases of major damage during the hurricane season from the beginning of summer to the peak.
The record-breaking typhoon warning, which was announced on a single day in the winter season, reached 150 times closer than before.
The American Meteorological Society has reports of typhoons and tornadoes that exceeded 400 cases on the 10th day of the month (Friday) at 4:00 p.m. local time.
According to this, there are two distinct areas, one on the south side of the line extending from Kansas to Texas, and another on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In the state of Kansas, the strength of the tornado was displayed on the modified Fujita Scale (EF Scale) by reaching EF3, the third strongest level of the scale, from the strongest level of 6th. Suddenly, a 70m/s gust of wind was blown.
There is a possibility that further research will confirm an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the conditions of Japanese buildings in accordance with the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of destruction caused by JEF3 is comparable to that of a typhoon in America.

The roar of "Rex" the largest in history, which was broadcast from beneath the stage, is also helping (Yahoo! News).
The president of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11 (Japanese time 12:00) showed a remarkable performance of "reading" the information about the devastating tornadoes in the United States.
American CNN television reported.
Biden emphasized that he would do everything as the federal government.
The full extent of the damage is still unknown.
Fear increased beyond 100 people.
Residents of KenTucky State, who were affected by the tornado, were seen carrying household items such as furniture and appliances from damaged homes to clear the debris on the night of May 10th and early morning of May 11th.
The range of damage from the storm was estimated to be around 250 miles (400 kilometers) this time, according to a meteorologist from CNN.
The immense damage to the factory in Kensington, Maryland was caused by the fire, which was still operating at the time.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the footprint was lost.
The woman felt the weight of the rescuer as she searched for her in the darkness, unable to move her body. Later, she searched for help on the top of the cave.
In the public broadcast that was aired, along with the woman's pleas for help and the sobbing of another woman, you could hear the singing of "Happy Birthday to You".
Anbara Brown, a convenience store employee in Meaford, Canada, was able to hide from the tornado warning in her basement with her 5-year-old son.
He shuddered at the thought of the terrifying sound like a distant thunderclap emanating from the train.
The police officer said, "The search activity will continue until it's no longer necessary.
She didn't know how long it would take, but she kept on with her tenacious rescue efforts.
At least six people were confirmed dead after a portion of a warehouse storing goods for Internet retailers in California's Inyo County collapsed.
The impact of a train derailment or a car accident on a highway can cause the closure of the area due to the danger of further collisions or explosions.
According to US web media, an estimated 40 million apartments in Tennessee have been affected by the power outage.

What is the difference between a female-specific doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology and a regular doctor?
A "specialist doctor" usually takes 3-5 years of residency training after graduating from medical school.
Both are known as "specialist doctors".
It is commonly known that "research medical" refers to the fact that a doctor graduated as a "research medical" and then completed a year of training before officially becoming a doctor.

This proverb has been around for a long time and suggests that thinking about evaluation systems for star-based systems is different from other systems.
Japan is arguing that it should add/subtract points based on three stars, while other countries are arguing that they should subtract points based on five stars from there.
The difference between two stars is that four stars are "notable" but "beautiful".
If a work is judged based on five stars, then the work that is not flawed can be considered the "highest standard" work. However, if the same system is used, the work that is not flawed will be judged as "perfect" and thus will be impossible to improve. Therefore, it is better to not present the star rating system on the current system.
If people start to argue against it, the conversation will become difficult to continue due to this evaluation system of Steam.

On the 12th, a man was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Saga City. The perpetrator was driving a motorcycle. This is an ongoing news story.
At around 1:25 a.m. on November 12th in Saga City, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was stabbed in the face by a man in his 30s to 40s.
The police are following the man's trail as he fled on a bike.
According to the police, a single person identified as 110 was reportedly shouting "kenkashi" (swearing) at the station.
Men often have a left hip bone that is about 10 centimeters in length and a depth of about one centimeter, but they still have an awareness.
The man who fled was wearing a skinhead.
It was reported that a knife that had been used in the crime was found nearby.

It took about a month to identify the cause of the CTD in a MOD environment.
They had to spend a lot of time trying to identify the cause of the problem, which was exacerbated by the lack of time to play with the data from March onwards.
Why wasn't the.Net Script Framework used to analyze the logs? (It can be figured out in a few minutes.) Some errors are related to DLL and assembly conflicts, which can't be fixed by a crash log.
The timing of the main CTD is up to you.
For this reason, all traces of papal blood and.Net Script Framework, log files of types.dll plug-ins are not left behind.
* When NPCs are killed in large numbers or when they are subjected to continuous attacks, the Essentials will be gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree氏SE updated version reopened) OFF to improve the possibility of getting wet clothes.
* Camera work for NPCs related to kills: Setting off kills via PC → Basic improvement by setting off kills via.ini: DAR+Nemesis conflict? However, the limit of 10,000 kills animation per DAR remains unchanged.
* Field Movement + Partial Magic (e.g. Ice Curse) Activation, NPC Death: Dirt & Blood v2.0's SPID-enabled NPC Appearance Settings (MCM's Right Top) Off, 5 Consecutive Attempts Improved.
Is this misconfiguration of the 2.0 SPID Default.ini caused by a syntax error? The intended result is that the NPC has the prerequisite Perk applied to it.
We initially focused on checking for wet clothes in OnHit relationship/battle MOD (dlls), but it resulted in such a feeling.
I hadn't expected to see the same bug report in English, German, and French.
If people are struggling with similar CTD issues in the Japanese language environment, they may find it helpful to refer to each other's experiences as a reminder.

It is important to consider the significance of spiritual care visitation nursing - today's visitation nursing has ended.
I have been visiting a caregiver for a long time and have built a very good relationship with the caregiver, who is a woman.
We have conversations about all sorts of things every week.
Although it is important to manage medication and dressings for physical illnesses (such as wound care), it is even more important for those with mental illnesses to have enjoyable communication, as well as for those with physical illnesses.

She's so beautiful, she's laughing in the mirror.
It is likely that both those who are receiving psychiatric care and those who are contemplating it will benefit from the experience.
Visiting a nurse is very beneficial for those suffering from mental illness.

China's five-year delay in implementing the Hydrogen Economy Load Map has slowed down. (Central China News in Japanese)
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
This plan aimed to popularize 6500 charging stations for electric vehicles across the country.
The target price of hydrogen was 6,000 yen (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
Unfortunately, this year's November fuel cell car target of 27% is too low.
The Hydrogen Station in the Core Infrastructure is aiming to reach 38% (approximately 117 locations) and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is expected to be the same as the time of the load map announcement with no large difference from 8400Won per ton.
It became clear that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap is falling short of its targets.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) released a report on the "Current Situation and Policy Directions" of the Hydrogen Economy on December 12.
According to their reports, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Toshiba (Japan), White Gold (Japan), Menburen (US), DuPont (US), 3M (US) and others supply the core materials for lithium-ion batteries for cars.
The number of water technology patents filed by the six countries (China, the US, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany) has been increasing steadily on average 14% per year since 2014.
Korea is the fifth largest country in the world in terms of patent applications in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020).
However, the WTO has been saying, "In reality, the major players in the water element market are six countries. In other words, they are the lower-tier countries."
The order of priority for patent applications by country is China, United States, EU, and Japan.
Since China took the top spot from the U.S. in 2017, it has been widening the gap by spreading its influence.
In 2020, Japan was ranked fourth in the world in terms of patent applications, with 974, while China had 4721 patent applications, accounting for 22% of the world's total.
The Japanese Confederation of Aviation has proposed that the government should designate "national strategic technology" as a priority for investment and research and development expenditure tax relief.

The LDP's Akira Amari, who was in charge of tax reform, was directly attacked for advocating for the suspension of the consumption tax.
The first special issue of Weekly Diamond magazine, published on December 18th, is titled "Family Talk at the End and Beginning of the Year".
This technique is known as "pre-natal transfer and imposition".
In the discussion of integrating the taxes on gifts and pre-gifts, the dreadful 2022 tax reform was brought up, but in the near future, pre-gift giving may be restricted more and more as a form of tax evasion.
What will change the rule of succession?
The LDP's former tax chief, Koichi Kato, has been actively promoting tax cuts and other economic policies since the party's victory in the 2019 election. He has been sharing his knowledge on taxation and other economic policies without reserving any topics for later.
(Diamond Editing Team, Miyahara Takashi)
● Transferring from a rural to a urban company member from a rural family ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ― ―
The party has been actively promoting the 2021 Tax Reform Draft, reaching out to both large-scale investors and the middle class.
That is why it is important to stop talking about it, to change the rules of connection and to stop the "forced donation" of pre-marital sex, which is the road to increased taxation.
This steel rule is to reduce taxable assets.
That powerful legacy gift has been widely utilized by companies even though it is a small amount, since it is tax-deductible even for those who own a home in the three major cities.
This discussion is about the concept of "unified taxation" of income and donations.
The 22nd tax reform package, which was announced on December 10th, included measures such as "continuously reviewing the system to ensure that it does not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family" and "perpetually revising the language to integrate the system" in order to achieve this goal. Furthermore, the instructions such as "non-taxable gifts are not subject to any tax burden even if they are within the family" and "continuously reviewing the system to ensure that it does not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family" were also included.
The head of the Tax Agency and the former chief of staff of the LDP, Yoshihisa Inoue, said something at the investigation of the editing department.
For that reason, it is most important to equalize the advantages and disadvantages of transferring wealth at different times.
In the simulation, what kind of problem arises? That is, due to the integration, what kind of problem arises? The chance of the fastest improvement is three times.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, in the near future we should avoid acting in the direction of cutting large taxes and instead prioritize pre-birth gifts.
How will the rules of successive and donation taxes change specifically?

Johnson's pass was intercepted three times in this game.
This was the first and only time the Bills have appeared in a Super Bowl.
In 1974, the legendary O.J. Simpson, a first-time 2000-yard rusher in the season, made his debut in the NFL.
The buildings were destroyed by a combination of Simpson and another person's run at the RB Blackstone.
The extreme offensive deployed by Petroryu was the maximum reason for this time's Petrorout.
Buffalo is a town in the north of Canada, close to the border with Canada, and it has not changed its latitude.
The temperature dropped significantly before the game, with a wind speed of 18m/s, and snowfall had already begun.
Unfortunately, the play selection didn't change much.
30 laps around the track equals 25 miles.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
Interception was impossible, but we persisted indefatigably.
There were 4 incursions of the Red Zone in the Offensive Series, and the Defense Point Machine was activated.
He challenged him three times in a row until the third quarter.
Unfortunately, she was only able to steal three points in that game.
The referee blew the whistle and the game was underway.
The building that was chasing after the 4th penalty was arrested at 3rd & 9, and became 3rd & 14.
It is 18 yards to the goal.
The quarterback was surrounded by the rush of the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense as he scampered out of the pocket and to the right.
He threw a pass but it was unsuccessful.
In this game, WR Steffon Diggs ran around the end zone and became free, but Allen's eyes were not able to catch him.
Alex from 4th&18 was chasing WR Gabrielle Davidson-Gaborik but the pass was deflected by Payton's left outside pressure and ended in a failed attempt.
Brian had been covering the WR Collar with a Manzuma Mannequin, but upon seeing Allen's movements, he released the WR Collar and reacted to the pass.
Alexander threw two passes to reach the end zone.
The fourth down was unexpected, but the third down was not important enough to warrant a TD hunt.
If you can win your first down in two games of play, it is good.
Since it was still 2 minutes before the 4th & Short race started, it was a surprise that his own running ability was still alive.

However, I believe that it is the same for everyone - that when faced with a sudden and unexpected challenge, we all have the innate ability to rise up and overcome it.
Humans will be able to use their power and skill, which they have accumulated until now, to awaken suddenly without any hidden tricks, and this will be possible with their original potential.

In addition, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, of course, reflecting customer needs through services and solutions that optimize consumer experiences in a relaxed manner.

24-Tractor Accident in Aichi, Tractor Operator Uninjured (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been determined that the driver of the truck involved in the accident in Aichi Prefecture's Mitsugi City was not injured, but that some kind of carelessness was the cause of the crash.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and cars collided on the Kagoshima Expressway in Shimabara City, resulting in 12 people being injured.
The police arrested 54-year-old suspect Noguchi Yasuhiro, who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing a hit-and-run accident on November 7th, and sent him for further investigation on the 12th.
The suspect's car was still moving forward without braking after the crash and the fire department arrived shortly after the accident, confirming that the suspect had lost consciousness temporarily.
However, it was determined that the suspect was not suffering from any illness, as originally suspected by the police.
The police are searching the suspect's home and investigating the situation in detail.

This woman is evaluating her own meat. (Weekly Pocket News - Comic Series Vol. 4)
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, has come to an end in Volume 4!
The first chapter focused on the preliminaries, but this new challenge is drawing attention and depicting the entire tournament!
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review by Oginamax ★★★★ (Star 5 out of 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the matches even begin!
This volume depicts a thrilling match of chess between a man and a robot wearing a mask of a person. However, it is not the only match that was drawn, as it was only the prelude to a match on the ring of destiny.
Since the tryouts began, you've changed a lot, but it's not like you can just give up now. Even if you've changed a lot, it's not like you can just quit now. That's not something you can do easily.
This tension in the air, gradually building up as the battle begins, is a feeling that readers can definitely relate to. It's a feeling of anticipation, of excitement, of dread, and of calculation. It's a feeling that something momentous is about to happen.
Then, the third-place match of the Teriyaki Man vs. Lucky Man will decide the fate of the championship.
While waiting for her to arrive at the venue, my favorite wrestler had been greeting her with a poster, "from now on, I'll be the one to take care of you!"
He is trying to tease her by tickling her chest.
Unfortunately, the terrified man silently put his hand over his mouth, stopped him from speaking and showed only his expression. The scene was that of him silently walking away, leaving everything else behind.
This is the last chance to fight the powerful Kinnikuman inside the tournament. There is no other opportunity to challenge him.
Unfortunately, there are such things as unbearable suffering.
You won't be able to resist imagining a vibrant future when you see something like that!
It's amazing how much has changed since that girl stood up, like how I'm suddenly feeling so much pain as a manga artist!
The fight went on for what felt like hours, but the aftermath was the tears of the referee of the match.
He yelled, "You can't handle the power of the divine run!"
That's the ticket.
You may have been thinking that the protagonist could not lose since he was the main character, but it turns out that he was not as powerful as he seemed. Even though the reader expected the protagonist to win, since he was the main character, it turns out that he was not as powerful as he seemed.
