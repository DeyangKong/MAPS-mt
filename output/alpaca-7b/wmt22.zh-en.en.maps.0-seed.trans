The students of Zhejiang University performed at the annual meeting of the university and showed their research achievements, which made people amazed.
Using the air to wash hands, smell of the air to diagnose disease, accurately searching for the source of fog, last night at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking scientific achievements were awarded prizes.
These projects were mainly done by students, covering various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students began from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical values, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biometric sensors: Your family doctor can check your health.
The School of Biomedical Engineering PhD student Zhang Dingming led a team to demonstrate a smartphone-sized biometric sensor at the scene.
All you need to do is to take a deep breath and exhale slowly into the instrument. It can then analyze the components of your breath to give you an initial assessment of your health condition.
Zhang Dingfang introduced the sensor and smartphone connection, after which air pollutants will be reported on the phone.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market. Common physical parameters that can be detected include temperature and heart rate.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as graphite, to detect chemical elements precisely and sense the body's health condition accurately.
Smart Surgical Lamp: Doctors' High-Tech Visual Aid
Besides smartphones, the operating room is also using smart surgical lamps.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Invention Exhibition of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 2019.
Zhu Lin, Jun Feng and their team at the Optoelectronics and Photonics School discovered a new approach to tackle the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented a smart LED surgical lamps.
Many diseases can be detected in the early stage and removed timely, and there is a relationship between the light used in the doctor's office and the surgery.
Shen Jifeng said, "If the doctor can't see the tumor tissues clearly during the early check of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread later."
This type of smart surgical light has four light bulbs, which can be adjusted to enhance the difference between different organizations under the light by adjusting the light spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size and brightness of the flare, the spectrum and color uniformity of the light according to the needs of the surgery and the patient's personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical light has been successfully tested in hospitals such as the Sihyuan Children's Hospital and the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the Challenge Cup 1st Prize.
Washing hands with air: Saving water, more fun!
Washing hands is just like using water, scrubbing with toothpaste, rinsing with water, and Lee Chin-Chang and his colleagues invented a "Air Hand Washing Device".
As long as we stand on the device, our body weight can be used to compress the air and reduce air pollution.
He was like a person playing with a firecracker.
The compressed air that was released formed a fluid and combined with the water at the dragon's head.
That's great! We can now wash our hands and make them clean and germ-free.
Experimental evidence shows that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as regular hand washing.
This device only requires relying on our own gravitational force as the driving force, able to guarantee washing cleanliness level, as well as saving 90% of water, making the whole process completely energy-saving and environment-friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Great Challenge Summit, this invention shined brightly and won the unique gold prize.
Please hurry and arrange the refund for me, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the money, do not collect points, or else you will not be able to use #PRS_ORG# again!
Bones and spicy Sichuan food are not suitable for small children to eat.
If it is, please order quickly.
We don't have it yet, thank you.
He called me to tell you where he was.
I didn't wait, I cancelled the order.
I bought the ticket, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can you change it?
You can either cancel the order or reject it.
That's frustrating.
The identity card is very meaningful——it can be used to save lives in an emergency.
This is one of the important skills certificates I feel proud of besides my driving license!
Emergency measures: Rescue operations should be taken as soon as possible when a sudden event occurs, such as when a fire breaks out in a rescue vehicle.
After an accident happened, the process of rescuing the car was still time-consuming, but it was the most crucial time.
This was the time when help was needed urgently.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, gold four minutes!
Therefore, the people around you are so important!
When faced with a dangerous situation, we should not just stand still and do nothing, but instead use our professional knowledge to rescue the person, rather than feeling helpless.
In China, there are about 300 million people who die from unexpected deaths every year, which is the most dangerous one called sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average rate of survival is 15%.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, one can survive with 78% chance, while the chance of surviving in Shanghai and Beijing is below 1%.
This is the first reaction of the founder Lu Le.
If a person suffers from cardiac arrest, their breathing and heartbeat will stop, as will their respiration and circulation. In this situation, CPR is useless.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to potentially save a person's life.
I discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of insight to learn emergency rescue skills, but when the situation arises, they come too late. Therefore, I would like to call on everyone to take the time to learn this skill, so that we can make timely reactions in the face of emergencies.
Even if it is uncertain, it is still possible to save a person's life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross Training Center. I am registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai and I have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself 25 years ago. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the list of goals was done several months ago, but it was definitely accomplished!
After I had finished applying for the other exams I wanted to take, I decided to apply for a diving certificate. I had seen in the Little Red Book that there was also a diving rescue certificate, so I thought it might be useful to have. In the end, having the diving rescue certificate proved to be very helpful when it came to taking the exam!

Because I entered the code beforehand, I was able to see it was valid.
Firstly, I believe "The Four Seasons" is a multi-faceted film, speaking from various perspectives.
However, you have to say whether the movie is noteworthy or not, either way it is not a bad pick for entertainment.
The movie can use numerous ways to excite you and make you feel relaxed after watching it. It can also use numerous ways to make you feel drowsy while you are in the cinema. 《四海》 is like a monkey on the mountain of Emei, able to use numerous ways to kindle your anger.
In terms of humiliating the audience, Han was truly a heavenly bestowment.
The most painful part of the film was the one that was a replica of a creature from the "Kingdom" series of novels, with its body parts hidden in a way that was reminiscent of a small horse's cloak.
After you finish watching it, you will be left with a feeling of suspicion as to whether there is a hidden message in the movie. However, when you think about it carefully, it turns out to be just a joke.
Firstly, I find it difficult to understand some circumstances.
The male head of the household should live in a south-facing location on a small island, with his wife as his lifelong companion.
She wished to go and see the snow in the neighborhood, and then the plot was arranged for her to take her big brother's sled and go to the East to see the snow.
Old people are sitting on the ski lift from South to North to see the snow?
He and his father were very relaxed about it.
After that, this old man didn't have any more business.
How did the female owner of the boat get the business license to operate a bar on the boat?
Why did the Flying Car Party manage to finish the mountain road so quickly?
Then the car stopped in the middle of the road, and the four drivers around it were unable to find the car.
This tool is too obvious.
Why did the small illegal party become a suspect in the police?
Why didn't the protagonist report the high-interest loan in the movie? The police officer asked him whether there was any difficulty.
A grown-up person was unable to use a smartphone, yet knew how to use a room card to open the door of a hotel, but was unable to find the hotel's staff. He then had to sleep outside the room door.
This kind of mysterious and exotic scenes are abundant throughout the entire film, due to the scenes being too explicit to the point that I can't help but recall them whenever I think about it.
Besides the plot, the main theme of the film was also disappointing. It was like a shallow and meaningless sewing together of unrelated scenes.
After watching the movie for 20 minutes, you might think it was a comedy, but after another 10 minutes, you might think it was an inspirational drama, depicting the struggles of young people in the rural town to survive. After the movie was over, you were left with a deep sense of confusion, wondering why you had gone to watch it in the first place.
For most people, the path of various types of films is already very familiar, such as you want to make a movie car stunt, then you need to be ambitious + comic and tell the audience one step by step how a lucky bird is walking towards success.
If you want to take a romance picture, then you just need to be realistic, honest, and tell the story of two young people in a small town and their service staff.
If you want to reflect real life, then the most important thing is to avoid introducing things that are out of the ordinary in the normal world.
(For example, the character of Zhang Ziyi in "Memoirs of a Geisha" was burned alive and then still managed to sing a song.) This means that you can't help but get sucked into the movie and forget about everything else afterwards.
Although Ming Na is a renowned actress, she is still like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, which I don't know whether it is her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I was also confused, why did Han Cang become so passionate about adding a car crash scene to his own movie?
Why would the movie arrangement be so tightly packed in the Spring Festival holiday?

Introduction of Zengzhou Brick and Block Production Line: Zengzhou Brick and Block Production Line is a kind of equipment for manufacturing precast concrete products. It is mainly composed of a mixing system, a molding system, a curing system, a conveying system, a stacking system and a control system. The mixing system is used to mix the concrete, and the molding system is used to produce the molds. The curing system is used to cure the concrete and the conveying system is used to transport the concrete to the mold. The stacking system is used to stack the products. The control system is used to control the whole production process.
Zhengzhou Yexin is a leading producer of concrete curing and inspection equipment in China, ranging from semi-automated to fully-automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we have prepared quality-assured hydraulic, mobile and fully automated borehole inspection systems and accessories.
Inspection of mud brick module production and assembly at the site in Zhengzhou: checking the production of mud brick modules.
Check the characteristics and advantages of Zengzhou brick mold production equipment.
This new type of brick material is suitable for various civil engineering projects such as coal, hot, water, electricity and gas.
For example: inspections of water-diversion structures, reservoirs, canals, sewage pools, small buildings, bridges, and walls.
The advantages of using hollow concrete blocks in constructing a well are as follows: the four sides of the block are uneven and the joints form a stepped structure, which can be combined with bricklaying to form a chain-linked wall.
The brick and mortar walls are superior to the rubble walls in terms of cutting resistance.
The module is used to form a hollow structure by combining bricklaying and pouring concrete, which is then connected by horizontal and vertical holes. After the concrete is poured and cured, a network of concrete walls is formed, which serves as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is equipped with transverse and longitudinal reinforcements, which can increase the overall strength of the structure.
Additionally, the use of concrete-filled steel tubes for inspection wells and sump holes ensures that the walls are stable, the operation is simple, and the dimensions are standard.
This intelligent control system for soil testing equipment integrates data input and output devices, a touch screen liquid crystal display, automated analysis of samples, density control, and fault diagnosis system to achieve ideal human-machine dialogue and real-time data processing.
The fluid pressure system employs a single-pipe or double-pipe design, depending on the application. It is used for conveying and transporting.
An isolated hydraulic system was installed to avoid vibrations from the host machine affecting the hydraulic system and thus ensure its reliability.
The mixer was prepared for the concrete inspection, block making, and pallet transportation processes, and the entire system was operated independently by the hydraulic system to reduce wear and tear and maintenance. The storage box was closed, and the pallet was automatically transported by the hydraulic system.
The exterior of the soil testing module brick machine is reliable and stable, equipped with sealing parts, computers, and other components. The combination of imported electronic components, hydraulic parts, and other components ensures its stable performance.
The platform uses a whole-body steel plate, the cutting line is cut without welding, and the filling box is free to swing directionally, effectively reducing mechanical wear.
By reducing the load of the mold, combining the material and vibrating synchronously, the effect of realism can be ensured.
The amplitude of vibrations generated by the vibrating machine is adjusted according to the material's price-performance ratio, without wear and tear, thus extending the service life and reducing costs.
The wall-mounted robotic module is equipped with both manual and automatic control functions.
Checking the drilling rig.
Xinyi checked the brick machine, cement mixer, and block table.
In the corner of the car park at Yixing Company, an order is being processed.
Checking the quality of the soil mixing module and its production and processing equipment.
The equipment for producing wall bricks and pavers in Zhenzhou includes a production line for checking the quality of the wall bricks and various types of pavers such as hollow blocks, solid blocks, and road pavers.

The modern apprenticeship school in Chengdu is now recruiting students. Upon admission, they will become company employees.
Yesterday, reporters from the city education committee learned that this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" model of human resource development in 60 schools, accepting students who have undergone trial training and simultaneously possessing the "apprentice" identity. After being enrolled, they will be pre-hired as unit employees by the trial enterprises.
The Education Bureau requires that all private schools recruit and enrol students in accordance with the regulations, clearly identify the student's status as either a full-time or part-time student, and enter into a tripartite agreement with the school and the employer. For students under 16 years old, a guardian, school, employer and student must sign a contract. The Education Bureau must be notified of the student's name, age, job title, employer's name and address, and the specific job duties and responsibilities.
Schools should adopt a modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with businesses to provide employees with front-line training and job rotation training.
Schools should reform their talent cultivation models.
The school and company jointly designed a talent cultivation program, to jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, teacher qualification standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
An internship cycle consists of an on-the-job training, student's practical time is determined according to their professional skills development plan, and a top-level internship usually lasts for 6 months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based learning management system should be implemented according to the characteristics of different specialties, one teacher can take 2-5 students to form a learning group, ensure the students acquire the necessary skills for each learning position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern education pilots, with each pilot having 50 to 60 students. In total, 3000 students will be trained.
Following the principle of trial and error, step by step advancement from point to face, exploring and establishing a long-term recruitment, training and integration mechanism of school and company, enhancing students' employability and improving their employment rate and quality.

South African doctors: AIDS is a powerful disease but multiple diseases are common.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new variant of the Coronavirus is more contagious and spreads faster than SARS.
According to the Associated Press, the spread of AIDS in South Africa has been reported by a group of 5,000 doctors from the province of Kwazulu-Natal. They said that the symptoms of the new cases of AIDS are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever similar to flu symptoms.
The organization's overall director Unben Pillay said that he has to see around 10 patients a day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
Paul said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days."
He said, this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more prone to contracting serious illnesses due to the virus.
He said, compared to the previous outbreak, the patients he treated in the current one had difficulty breathing and had low hemoglobin levels.
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
During the two weeks after the first case of pneumonic plague was reported in the south of Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data requires a few weeks of time, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some starting points.
According to South African research, in the recent weeks of hospitalization, only 30% of new COVID-19 cases were severe, which was half of the pre-epidemic relapse rate; the average hospital stay shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; in the recent cases of COVID-19 in South Africa, the mortality rate was 3%, which was 20% lower than the early outbreak cases.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, cited data and other reports to say: “Currently, almost all the evidence suggests that this is a mild disease.”
He also said, "We need to wait for the later data."
Under normal circumstances, the time of hospitalization and death due to infection is later, but we have entered the time of this wave of infection only two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing current vaccines and treatments.
Despite being the most important new virus disease in the world, Deltat has been reported in over 30 countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to the health department, the number of new cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Guangdong Province in the first week of December increased by 400%. Tests showed that the proportion of cases was over 90%.

Education evaluation: What can we do to save the children from being left behind?
If the famous public service advertising slogan "No buying, no selling, no harm" is compared to the notorious crime of "blackmailing", then in a good environment without "extortion", the prevention of crime will be more effective, the risk of crime will be reduced, the cost will be high and the crime will not occur.
Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department announced the launch of a platform for urgent dissemination of information on child abduction.
This is to establish a powerful and efficient channel to publish lost children information and to create a timely and effective platform to find lost children.
After hearing the name of this App, "Tuan Yuan", I felt warmth in my heart.
The new technology is not only named "Wen Yi" (art) and filled with emotion, but also information-ified application is practical and effective.
To apprehend the perpetrator and to recover the abducted child is the primary goal, to ensure the safety of the child and their family's freedom.
It was only then that the trial and punishment of the suspect began.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to law education, can be listed as many "big words".
Before breaking the news of the failed sale, one should prioritize the physical safety of the victim.
In times of crisis, it is difficult to find a balance between the heavy burden of responsibility and the urgency of the situation. For example, the debate on whether or not to impose capital punishment on child traffickers is a highly controversial topic. We must be cautious and considerate when discussing it.
According to the experience of handling such cases, human traffickers tend to get away as soon as possible after committing the crime.
Searching for a missing child can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The further the child is from home, the more difficult it will be to find them. The difficulty of the case will also increase with each minute that passes.
Under such circumstances, extracting information from platforms like "Quick Circle" can be directly helpful in cracking cases, searching for missing children, which is an effective action.
After all, "putting an end to corruption" is a task that requires an entire legal system to be put in place.
To perfect the law from its perfection to its enforcement, as well as to protect the interests of parents and children, we must adhere to the spirit of "defending the weak".
In addition, prevention of child abuse can be done in both family and society in a better way.
For example, a common scenario is that a family of three was taking a nap at the train station, only to wake up and discover that their child was missing.
Parents cannot expect a two-year-old to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, they should at least have some basic protective awareness.
Both parents took turns to relax and recharge while their child was protected safely underneath them. This was the most effective preventive measure against losing their child.
From the perspective of the police, cracking down on illegal activities is important. But from another perspective, it is also important to pay attention to and supervise the children who are involved in the illegal activities.
A single person's unlawful act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese Penal Code, the sentencing for selling children for prostitution is 5 years; it is an extremely serious offense and can result in the death penalty, with no confiscation of property.
At the height of punishment, the heaviest punishment is imposed, and the trend of light punishment is obvious. The crime is clearly more serious than the punishment.
There are still many shoplifting cases happening every year.
Although some people have a shallow understanding of parenting and upbringing of children in the family, the legal awareness is still weak.
Legal education for this group should be synchronized and progressed.
To effectively control illicit sales, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement of laws and regulations by the government.
If there is a wide presence of the market, the sellers will be eager to make profits and continuously innovate selling methods, thus forming a confrontational relationship with the buyers and creating a situation of low efficiency.
Therefore, it is beneficial to have a clear understanding of the law, which can help prevent and control illegal activities such as gambling and child abuse.
Comrade Yang Hongdong delivered a speech at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th National Congress of the CPC in the Great Hall of the People.
Drawing strength from the Chinese Communist Party's century-long struggle, we will strive forward with vigor.
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th, the provincial committee, the propaganda department, and the party chief, Yang Huan, delivered a speech at the video creation base in Ma'an Mountain, deeply studying the spirit of the 19th Party Congress of the CPC and learning to practice the important instructions of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the CPC. They also studied the spirit of the 12th Provincial Congress of the CPC.
Yang Huan from the ideal of faith and enthusiasm, self-revolution and youthful enthusiasm, the core values and requirements of the party and the party's leadership and theoretical perspectives from three aspects, combining his own understanding and personal experience, systematically expounded on the core meaning and practically applied it.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches given by Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang with the spirit of the provincial and national congresses, and strengthen the sense of unity and defense of the "two unities" and "two consolidations" in an instinctive, political and practical way.
During the interactive dialogue, the representatives of the grassroots, enterprises and youth discussed the relationship between the three historic decisions, the meaning of the "two establish" decision, how to grasp the direction of the enterprise, and how the new generation can draw power from the century-long party history. Yang He, in a plain language and vivid examples, answered the questions, encouraging the youth party members to draw power from the century-long struggle of the party and to tightly unite with the party center.

It will also implement a dynamic management system to provide at least five job opportunities for each graduate and ensure that all graduates have job intentions.
In reality, I don't know whether it was the store's mistake or my own mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Investigation was unable to be completed.
I hope you will understand this.
Because the delivery time was much faster than the display, it took 30 minutes.
No need, thank you.
That's great, you've changed your bike!
He had waited for a long time.
That restaurant has always been talking about processing orders.

The International Olive Council has divided virgin olive oil into two categories: first-pressing olive oil and refined olive oil. There are five grades in total.
The original castor oil or known as natural castor oil, is directly obtained from the fresh fruit material of castor oil plant by mechanical chilling and filtration processes to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin Oil (Top Grade): It is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is pure natural product.
The fragrance of the flower is exquisite, with a gentle sweetness and a mildly sour taste.
Superior quality Fine Virgin Olive Oil is characterized by a slightly higher acidity, but still below 2%, and a correct, strong aroma.
The Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil has a maximum acidity of 3.3%, with a mild and pleasant flavor.
The fatty acid content of the rapeseed oil after refining should not exceed 3.3%, otherwise it will become "secondary oil".
The oil can be divided into two levels: refined and unrefined.
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil in order to achieve a balance of flavor, aroma and color. Its acidity should be under 1.5%, and it should be transparent and golden yellow in color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: This is a refined oil obtained by extracting and refining olive pomace oil through a chemical process.
You should have already discovered that the acidity of castor oil is an important indicator of its quality.
Pineapples are similar to grapes in making wine, with different varieties of pineapples from different regions and species producing different grades of pineapple oil.
The best place for the growth of oil palm is:
The coastal and offshore areas have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for oil palm growth, such as temperature, sunshine, humidity and rainfall.
Excluding the coastal areas and other land regions, the only place suitable for zero-gravity cultivation is the habitable zone.
Major production area:(Inland Sea)
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, France, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, South Africa, etc. have similar climates to those in the South.
Harvest month of Oil palm.
From March to June, the flowers of the oil tree bloom and fruit starts to grow and mature. The color of the fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season of fruits and vegetables (the freshness of toasted sesame oil can be very important).
The nutrients of olive oil are:
Olive oil is rich in fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acids, as well as alpha-linolenic acid, vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Vegetable Oil has been found to be the most suitable oil for human body nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The plenary session of the National People's Congress has concluded, and the Chairman has stepped down from the podium. The flame of freedom will never die out.
The Online Summit for Democracy, attended by over 110 countries' government and civil society leaders and private sector representatives, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
During his closing remarks, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said, "The flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world."
He also expressed his plan to convene the second Global People's Congress in 2020.
Taiwanese government representative and human rights activist Luo Guangzhong also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know that the work that is being done in front of us is immense and daunting."
However, we also know that we can accept the challenge, as I said before, just as this summit has demonstrated, the democratic world is still alive.
The flame of freedom can never be extinguished, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Pep Guardiola expressed that the defense of democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be mindful of those who put their own interests before the public good."
The second day of the National People's Congress focused on defending human rights, preserving democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital totalitarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is coincidentally "International Human Rights Day".
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democracy movement is facing a challenge on a global scale, particularly due to the new digital technology.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values and standpoints, as well as our democratic spirit."
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding women's and girls' opportunities.
This also requires resolute self-criticism in all its forms, including nationalism, localism and radicalism, as well as the use of all available tools provided by the technology revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activists Rose Lok and Tenzin Jigme delivered a speech at the conference, reminding and encouraging everyone to pay attention to the human rights situation of the Hong Kong and Tibetan minorities in China.
He said: “For a long time, the world has been receiving the Chinese Communist Party’s rising, yet without establishing any mechanism to hold it accountable.”
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
We must utilize all the resources we possess to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task.
Luo Guanzhong also urged the world to unite against the threat of communism.
He said, "Perhaps some people in your group are afraid of, dismayed, or offended by Xi Jinping's totalitarianism, or perhaps some people have lost sight of the Communist Party's threat to our democratic values."
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also why we must change.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council's Tang Fong attended the roundtable discussion titled "Fighting Digital Isolationism and Defending Democratic Values" and released the National Statement through video. She emphasized that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and oppression.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the novel coronavirus through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "At the frontline of democracy in Taiwan, we will always stand firm and resist the authoritarianism of global power. We also strive to promote global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic period, authoritarian governments around the world have been rationalizing violations of human rights by claiming to prioritize public health and collective interests. This has resulted in a retreat of global democracy, as evidenced by the signs of the times.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down the flag to fight fake news.
At the same time as the second day of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's meeting was held, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for serious violations of human rights. It also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that had been found to use surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the Bird's Eye Chicken that was sent to the restaurant is alive.
I want to try playing tennis but I'm afraid of myself, so I'm looking for an affordable price to take lessons first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price tends to be higher than the friendly level, if you can not distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap bargain, this kind of "entry-level" shooting is industrial waste.
They have very low strength, the ball can be hit to the top of the net, the vibration is very big, the hard ball can not be stopped, and it is difficult to control the powerful players.
The logic and slang of basketball are difficult to understand, but you can't learn it and you can't buy expensive things. You can make it cheap and easy by playing two times, so you won't have to fight again. This way, basketball will be easy and inexpensive.
When you can distinguish good from bad, it means you have made progress. Come back and buy expensive things here, and I'll make two times the money.
Suggestion: Buy a used camera, such as a Prince or Dynax, since these brands have no prestige and are thus reasonably priced. Used cameras for 500-600 yuan are good enough, while 200 yuan used cameras are worth the enjoyment.
Treat newcomers kindly, but once they've passed the newcomer stage, they'll be treated like regulars. However, most people, especially women, won't be able to pass the newcomer stage.

Within three years, the Sichuan Province will send 10,000 teachers to train the singing and dancing of rural primary and secondary schools.
The Education Department of Jiangxi Province has been recruiting 100,000 music, art and sports teachers for rural schools since 2016.

In reality, there is much to consider when dressing and accessorizing for a petite girl with body image issues.
The girl can't wear a skirt that is too short or too long, the difference should be just around the knee, and it can cover up the legs perfectly.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the bulge in the thighs.
When you are too tall, you will feel embarrassed and bloated.
If you wear different colors of clothing, such as a dress, skirt and long socks, you will look more natural. The different colors of the clothing can make your body look longer and slimmer.
In reality, many petite girls are wearing deep colors such as black, navy, and burgundy as their uniforms, which the author has deep understanding of. Deep colors are also a good way to hide their body shapes, while the high-end and elegant black skirt is their first choice.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a black skirt, will make you appear thinner.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear your pants and shoes too tightly, or people will notice it.
The more diverse the population becomes, the more important it is to preserve cultural identity. Color should not be too bright or too flashy.
When people pay attention to your leg and foot, they will get the feeling of being fat.
For the little girl who is slightly chubby, it is important to teach her how to dress and accessorize properly.
Don't wear tight-fitting clothes that make you look bigger, and avoid wearing short or too-tight pants that will make you look even more unflattering. If your legs are thick, you can choose a black opaque tights or a grid-like skirt, which will help to hide your body. You can also choose a soft and flowy maxi dress to cover up your body and make you look slimmer.
Of course, the petite girl also has a lot of charm when she wears short skirts.
The little girl should choose a color that matches the short skirt, which will give her a curvier figure with an added heightened effect.
Shorts and high heels are the perfect combination to make your legs look longer and chicer for the summer!
If you are plus-sized, but have slim legs, we recommend choosing a beautiful feeling long skirt.
Not only can it block out large pores, but it can also showcase your advantages.
A-shaped dresses will make you look slim, which is more suitable for plump girls. When wearing a dress, choose a tight-fitting one to create a layered and slimming effect.
A simple white T-shirt and shorts can be a great base for any outfit. Even those with a fuller figure can try experimenting with different styles.
The chubby girl can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they can grasp the rules of wearing clothes and accessories, even the most petite girls will become the focus of attention.
In terms of clothing and accessories, there have been changes, but in life we should also move more, strive to break away from the label of "little fat girl" early in the morning.

The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League will ignite the passion for winter sports and heat up the atmosphere of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which will begin on January 1, 2021 in Beijing.

Girls Scouts collect donations to help their sisters who were injured in the Sichuan Earthquake.
A young girl was standing in front of a wooden plank at the entrance of a park in Hangzhou. The wooden plank had the words “human flesh” and “arrow” carved on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl in Hangzhou donating money to charity with the caption “Giving is Fun” went viral on WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden plank which is slightly taller than the average person. The plank has the words “human target” and “10 yuan one arrow” written on it. This implies that after paying for the arrow, the person can use a bow and arrow to shoot the target.
This behavior triggered a heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday, the police department in the city of Hangzhou confirmed to the reporter from the Xinhua News Agency that the girl had made a donation to her sister before she became overly excited and started to demonstrate, but such behavior is not worth emulating, and she had already left the local police station by the time.
A girl on the street was begging for money. She held a "arrow" in her hand, which was actually a wooden stick. She was telling people that she was injured and needed money for medical treatment.
On the internet, a long-haired girl wearing a "ghost" mask stood in front of a wooden board, writing "human flesh bullet, 10 yuan one arrow" in black ink on the board. In front of her, there was another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat/Alipay numbers written.
This picture caused a controversy after it was posted online.
Some people think this is "bullying" behavior, but many others expressed sympathy.
We arrived at the square at around 10am when we noticed the situation. By then, the crowd had already dispersed.
The police station near the scene of the incident accepted the media interview of the local people, and the two girls, aged 20, were dressed up in a youthful and beautiful manner.
A girl was crying in the middle of the road, begging the people around to play the game with her. Another girl was standing beside her, helping her drink and talking about her sick sister who needs an urgent surgery fee. Please help them.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister, who has leukemia.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City Xiaoshan Branch informed the reporter of the New Beijing News that the girl's name is Jiaqi Li, and she is 13 years old. She donated money to her sister, who is also named Jiaqi Li.
Although the treatment still requires a lot of money, people were too busy to think of a good way to donate or contribute. Therefore, they resorted to such behavior.
He said, during the entire process, two girls were the lookouts, one responsible for holding the gun and the other one was just observing, but neither of them fired any shots. All they did was take pictures and post them on Weibo.
The police department identified the offenders and confiscated their bows and arrows which did not belong to the regulated scope.
The responsible person expressed that, “ We do not advocate adopting this kind of fundraising method.”
After the police warned and advised her, she had already left the police station.
The heat dissipation effect is good, the thinness degree is convenient, the exterior material is satisfactory, and the price-performance ratio is very high.
The new machine is very good.
Performance is stable, four fans dispersed heat without any problem, worth recommending.
This game is great! It has a lot of fun and challenging levels, plenty of resources to build with, and a cool brand!
The price of the gaming laptop is still not worthwhile.
I think the gameplay of Heroes of the Storm is good, with a soothing effect, able to play most games, the frame rate is stable, very smooth, lol is not present, CSgo is easy to win, most 3a games can be played.
Cooling Effect: The cooling effect is good, the fan is very powerful, the working effect is quite comfortable, the gaming effect is still impressive.
The visual quality of the game is impressive, with a cool and exciting atmosphere. The graphics display effect is very clear on the screen, and the game is smooth enough at 1080p.
Buying a notebook feels so satisfying, mainly for design purpose. The price-quality ratio is very high, lighter than expected, and more beautiful than imagined. The red color of the ass is a very good-looking color of wine, not as floral as expected. It exceeds expectations in many aspects, and is a great purchase. Girls will also find it suitable.
Two years ago, he began to contact the Grim Reaper on his motorcycle, and it has been two years since then. The experience has been costly and of poor quality!

He had intended to buy the foreigners a gift, but he was too late and had to buy it in advance, so he missed out on the 418 Bank activities. He was a bit disappointed.
Although the price was high, the delivery was fast, so we will come back and give a review after a while.
This gaming laptop has a high price, good design, and has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: The child bought the software to do 3D painting, and it worked without any problems. This computer can perform 3D design work with impressive speed.
I bought him a present, and he said it was very good.
The computer is very good, especially its customer service attitude is very good, not difficult to ask questions, recommend buying.
The graphics of playing games are really impressive.
What will be the hottest trend in 2021?
Without doubt, the Beijing Olympics was the greatest event ever.
Do you think only healthy athletes can win medals?
The article "Quick Look! An Olympic Project Manager Can Crush Any Giant Brand" in the front section of the newspaper was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can always be the first to act and no one can match them in their daily routine of shifting bricks, taking risks, and working overnight. They also have the skills to save fires, bake pizzas, and face any challenges.
The article appears to be lighthearted, but it also conveys the struggles of current project management work, inspiring people to take action.
Employees who are engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to take action to make themselves free from the difficulties in the work.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certified professionals increases every year, more and more project management professionals are able to enhance their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the 2019 China Project Management Development Report, the total number of people who have taken the PMP exam in China has reached 600,000, with 420,000 people obtaining the PMP certification, accounting for 31.2% of the global total.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing steadily, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on simple and straightforward approaches can no longer bring success. The ever-changing work environment makes us realize that we need to learn and explore new paths.
However, after passing the PMP exam, one can ensure project management work flows smoothly without any obstacles.
Many beginner project managers expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they were able to gain a systematic understanding of project management's ten domains and five process groups, however, when it came to actually managing projects, they still felt like they were wading through a sea of fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, absence of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and workflow support, unable to keep track of the progress, unrealistic project estimation, lack of project management sensitivity and flexibility; unclear division of labor, team members not working efficiently, "old oil barrel" not knowing how to address cross-departmental communication, project progress difficult to promote.
As a result, our focus on product innovation and development management has helped numerous excellent companies to nurture and grow their product managers and project managers, as well as to win the honor of “China’s Corporate Development Management Talent Training Base” and “Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Course”.
The online course 'Developing Project Manager Training' is an effective way to learn project management skills, by combining real-world case studies, tools and methods from various development-focused companies. It helps you acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to become an effective project manager and take your career to the next level.
This is an opportunity to let the company use lower costs and less investment, to promote project managers' training process, and to bring about efficient operation results for the company.
With hard work, you can even evaluate other students' opinions on this course: This course is not only taught by China Hua Xia experts (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many famous companies' real-world business scenarios, providing in-depth and shallow explanations of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, abundant form templates to help students convert the contents learned in class into real-world applications.

Advertisers should lead rational consumption among consumers - Economy Observation Network
This year's Double Eleven Shopping Festival saw a total of 1.77 trillion yuan in online payments, an increase of 20.3% over last year.
The Chinese government has been giving out large and generous red envelopes to stimulate consumption, leading to a surge in consumption and a boost in the economy. On the one hand, this has caused people to be more excited about national consumption and to spend more. On the other hand, it has also caused us to become more passive and to reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
Before arriving at the “Double Twelve” shopping festival, JD.com (short for Jingdong) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to build good consumption habits and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 2020 Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Report, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, higher by 2.04 than in 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese citizens in the financial consumption layer is better, but there is still a large difference in the financial behavior and skills. We need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Older people and young people have a relatively low financial literacy level, which is still the focus of financial education. The report published by Nielsen and the Central Television Finance Report show that young people have a huge consumption potential, credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Despite the overall rational consumption trend, some young people have excessive consumption and frivolous consumption behavior, resulting in excessive debt and risk, even leading to social problems, financial institutions should be brave to accept social responsibility and guide in a positive direction.
As a long-term, stable financial institution, we always strive to provide quality and caring services to help people build a happy life. We advocate for consumers to establish proper and correct consumption habits, and actively respond to regulatory calls to improve the rationality of consumer behavior.

The People's Newspaper of Vietnam - The South China Sea Cooperation Committee Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover station of the King of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, includes the countries of the Arab League (e.g. Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, etc.), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this was the first time in 2017 that the King of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, visited Kazakhstan. This was also the first time that the Saudi-led coalition imposed a naval blockade on Yemen since the Yemeni crisis began.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE have severed ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo, accusing it of supporting terrorism and having a close relationship with Iran. Meanwhile, they also have a close relationship with Kuwait.
The strained external relations have had a serious impact on the internal cohesion of the Haiphong Coalition and have had a negative effect on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the overland, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 January meeting of the China-Pakistan Maritime Cooperation Committee in Beijing, when the two countries signed an agreement to gradually move towards “cooperation and stability”.
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are currently appointing new ambassadors to Cairo and are exerting efforts to restore their relationship with Cairo.
The Arab countries and Cuba must resolve their differences in order to restore their relationship, which is necessary for the benefit of each country and the stability of the region. They must join forces to confront common challenges.
During the visit of King Salman to China, the two sides agreed to open up the first direct land road connecting the two countries' coastal areas.
The 725-mile-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the citizens of both countries, helping them to cooperate more in travel and business.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion US dollars in Abu Dhabi, and the two countries' companies have signed a memorandum of understanding worth 300 billion US dollars.
The Islamic Republic of Iran and the world's major powers, including China, have been negotiating a joint comprehensive action plan (JCPOA) to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.
Each coastal country has always seen Iran as a long-term rival and perceived Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country in the region considered the issue of Iran's missile activities as a problem that could not be resolved, and failed to take any action to contain Iran's activities in the region. This was a dangerous weakness.
In the wake of the failure of the talks between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program, Saudi Arabia and Iran have begun direct negotiations.
The target is to upgrade the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the decrease in tensions in the South China Sea and the national economic growth.
The upcoming Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok, Thailand, will be the first time since the end of the long-running disputes between some of the member countries and Cambodia that all 10 member countries will be gathering together.
This is the ASEAN-China Maritime Cooperation Committee's opportunity to contribute to the recovery of the ASEAN Maritime Forum and to promote cooperation among its members, while also proposing various measures, so that its member countries can fully cooperate, to effectively address the common challenges, for the stability and development of the ASEAN countries.
From 7:00 to 9:30, I still haven't sent it off, so I have to return the money and cancel the order.

The sound of people running in the New Mountain District was the loudest!
This car we brought to you is the fulfillment of many men's dreams!
It is the flagship supercar from Lamborghini - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the car is near two hundred million yuan, and the road tax for one year is about ten thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because you have the power of 700 horses, can you imagine how fast it can be?
Even the editor doesn't know, the data shows that it needs 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is almost the same as myvi's 30km/h speed.
The low-slung car body, the aggressive scalpel-like door handles, the pervasive sense of power emanating from the huge exhaust pipe, and the luminous glass interior of the 6.5 v12 engine - all of these elements perfectly capture the essence of the Lamborghini style.
For explanation of car models, it is not necessary to say too much. Just Google it and you will find some helpful explanations!
Everyone was watching the same thing, but it was so interesting that no one felt bored! (It was actually quite cool!)
The cost of 1km of fuel is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care).
Practice the posture of driving a car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because it will be difficult to get out of the car).
The sound of the engine was too loud, so I had to turn down the volume of my ears after getting off the car. (But it was still very comfortable.)
Your car is too big to park in the ordinary parking lot, and you're afraid of being hit by the car door when it opens!
There was a bit of loneliness because there was no one on the road (I was talking to the driver, nothing to do with the car).
Everyone should not make a mistake, this video is not for sale, sorry!
Want to take a video of your love car? Welcome to contact us!
You can find more car-related news from various fields at The Car Guide / People's Car Journal.
The car accident was worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both widely recognized by car enthusiasts. Chiron is the world's most expensive supercar and Porsche 911's car price is also in the million-dollar range!
Before that day, foreigners crashed a million supercars, including the Chiron, in a matter of minutes!
Seeing the results, wealth is definitely rational!
Allowing college spirit and era spirit to resonate in harmony - China News
The term "University Spirit" refers to the set of education philosophy and values pursued by a university over a long period of time during its development. It is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of universities has been instrumental in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, ultimately leading to the progress of a nation.
The University of Chicago was born in the modern age with a unique mission, different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it was a difficult period of time, influenced by traditional culture and modern changes. The University of Chicago advocates the values of "enlightenment and harmony" and "strengthening the nation" with its patriotism.
The trend of internationalization and informatization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, leading to fierce global education competition, technology competition and human resource competition. This provides the higher education industry with a great opportunity and challenge.
The proposal of "Integrated Plan for Building a World-Class University and World-Class Academic Disciplines" displayed the Chinese government's confidence and determination to make progress in the field of higher education. It also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to quickly climb to the top of the world-class rankings in a short period of time, while still maintaining a certain distance from the base and accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and disciplines?
In addition to targeting self-confidence, path-confidence, and ability confidence, a college should also fully exploit three advantages: first, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas scholars, it can acquire advanced experience from world-class universities and significantly enhance its academic level and quality assurance; second, it can inherit the profound wisdom of the Chinese civilization which has been cultivated for over 5,000 years; third, it can take advantage of the superior system of socialist countries to strengthen motivation, build a good brand and enhance its image.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that constructing a top-tier university for the world is impossible with a thousand schools on a single campus, so each school must differentiate itself to highlight its own advantages and features.
Chinese-style education should have both a collective and individualistic approach, with each school cultivating its own traditions and resources, while also manifesting its own unique target positioning and educational practices.
With regards to Zhejiang University, we emphasize three distinct features from the perspective of innovation and entrepreneurship: 1. Fostering an integrated learning environment for entrepreneurial talent, by constructing a fusion of education and business, and forming an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship education. 2. Optimizing the academic system by encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, and creating an environment for the emergence of new and distinctive cross-disciplinary projects. 3. Promoting the development of a comprehensive service system for students and society, by actively engaging in international exchanges and cooperation.
In this process, it is especially important to remain steadfast in university spirit, allowing the university spirit to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the core values of "seeking innovation", "studying hard", "moral integrity", and "practical ability" are expressed in the spirit of "exploring the river and ocean, cultivating the people, and building a strong country".
This is a school that persists indefatigably in the correct direction of schooling, constantly accumulating culture at a high level, and concentrating spirit and meaning in a profound way.
The first emphasis is to open up and embrace a spirit of inclusiveness, manifesting in the pride of being a "world-class university" for nurturing talents. The second emphasis is to pursue excellence and integrity, exemplified by the perseverance of Tao Xingzhi and Liu Heng in their pursuit of truth and moral integrity. The third emphasis is to innovate and reform, encompassing both knowledge-seeking and technological innovation, as well as a commitment to national revitalization.
This series of spirit and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120th anniversary celebrations.
The wise hear silence, the clever see nothing.
China's higher education should seize the opportunity to further consolidate its position in the global market, and deepen its understanding of the historical mission and burden of the higher education industry. This will accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should guard the humanistic spirit of independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times interact with each other, and thus provide inexhaustible energy for the realization of national strength and ethnic revival, and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, "If we resolve the nuclear issue, there is a chance of reaching an agreement."
On December 11th, 2018, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani held a press conference in Doha, Qatar. He said that if the US lifted its sanctions against Iran, the Iranian nuclear issue could be fully settled through negotiations, thus achieving a "good agreement".
According to the website of the President of Iran, Leader Ahmadinejad spoke at the opening ceremony of the conference, submitting a proposal to other countries related to the nuclear issue, which has proven Iran's sincerity in negotiations.
If the US and China reach an agreement, “the road to the agreement will be smooth”.

The maximum duration of the leave for entrepreneurship of college students in Guangxi can reach 5 years.
The Ministry of Education recently announced that all schools in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will adopt a flexible learning system. This means that students will no longer have to take a break during the school year, and the duration of their break can be extended from two to five years. This will provide more opportunities for students to explore their creative potential and develop their entrepreneurial skills.
To promote university students' entrepreneurial innovation ability, the Education, People's Livelihood and other departments of Guangxi jointly built an entrepreneurial platform, and established more university student internship teaching base, university science park, university student entrepreneurial park, and entrepreneurial incubation base, providing outside protection for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, each college and university should have an innovation and entrepreneurship practice base with an area of at least 3,000 square meters for undergraduate students and 2,000 square meters for postgraduate students.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship courses, giving priority support to students who demonstrate excellence in innovation and entrepreneurship practices.
School teachers must spend at least two months in the workplace to gain practical experience and enhance their innovation and entrepreneurial education.
The Education Bureau of Guangxi requires that all schools in the region should actively promote and deepen the implementation of the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, striving to ensure that each college student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school period.
High schools should organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

When NFTs were hot, a new concept of cryptocurrency community emerged.
In 2021, the blockchain game 'Axie Infinity' had a huge impact in the Southeast Asian region, causing some people to lose their job opportunities. However, these people have since then found a stable income by playing this game.
Axie Infinity is an NFT-based pet-raising game powered by blockchain technology, featuring various play modes and has already exceeded 30 billion US dollars in transaction volume, making it the highest NFT project to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded 820 million US dollars, surpassing "King of Glory".
On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 100 million.
Axie Infinity will bring a new "palytoearn" mode to more people with the help of blockchain and intelligent contracts. Players are no longer single characters, and can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the game's ecological governance.
This kind of subjectivity cannot be granted by game developers, but instead must be ensured by blockchain technology.
After seeing news about a certain stock price, my greatest feeling was choosing the right industry for investment, which is the stock market. First, you should choose a large growing industry, at least over 1000 million market size; Second, choose a promising industry with good growth potential; Finally, choose an industry with good policy support.
The scope of the track is determined by the market size, the length of the track is determined by the stage of the industry's development, and the track is flat or mountainous depending on the industry's rivalries.
Let's give it our all for the track!
The new year is the first task to review 2021 and adjust 2022 battle plans.
The essence of strategy is "do the things right", which means "doing the things correctly".
Therefore, correct strategy is "do the right thing".
Strategy is to find direction, tactics to prepare for the fight, in most military thinking, there is room for strategic thought.
For example, how to increase customer number in the current market (strategic thinking) or how to extend the market in the future (strategic thinking)? How to improve customer retention rate (strategic thinking)? How to improve core customer and high-value customer retention rate (strategic thinking)? How to increase activity participation rate (strategic thinking)? How to set correct activity KPI, reach correct activity target, such as increasing customer participation rate, activating inactive high-value customers, and refining targeting (strategic thinking)? How to improve DAU (strategic thinking)? Is the current growth healthy and sustainable?
In 2021, the Bitcoin price will experience several milestones, such as the 12th birthday of the cryptocurrency.
On September 7th, Svalbard and Jan Mayen will adopt Bitcoin as their official currency, making it the first time Bitcoin has been used as an official currency by a country or region.

The wedding dress photography base (in Hebei) is temporarily unavailable for rent.

The makeup artist was very kind and helped me design a makeup look that suited my face. The photographer took humorous photos during the shoot, which were worth good reviews.
I would like to thank my photographer and makeup artist for making me look so beautiful even after having a baby.
The beautiful woman was lustful and seductive, with a charming and captivating gaze. Her body was well-proportioned and attractive, and upon seeing her one could not help but think her to be a virtuous wife and a good mother. She was diligent and hardworking, and thus was able to maintain her household with ease.

After seeing my wedding photo, I realized I had been "duped" all along.
A group of ethnic minority students from Yunnan Province filed a lawsuit against the East China Normal University for discrimination.
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice Department, protesting discrimination against Asian American students in the admission process of three universities - University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University.
The Alliance for Equal Education, which initiated the lawsuit, held a news conference in Washington D.C. that day.
Group President Sue Wang spoke at the Press Conference, saying that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of US universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three US universities has generally maintained a stable level.
Research has shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the holistic admissions process.
According to Zhao Yuxuan, the research conducted by the 2014 Stanford team showed that the Asian-American applicant rate was the lowest among all racial groups at the three universities.
According to the data from the US Department of Education, in all Ivy League universities, Brown and Dartmouth have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while Yale and Princeton have been practicing affirmative action for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told the reporters from the Chinese Embassy in the United States that they hoped the U.S. Department of Education and Justice could open an investigation and take necessary measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian Americans after the fact was confirmed.
They also hope that the school will take active measures to address this issue and change its recruitment policy towards minorities.
Currently, three schools involved in the lawsuit have yet to respond.
In 2015, the Asian American Education Alliance was founded to challenge Harvard University's discriminatory admission practices, but the US Department of Education rejected the complaint for procedural reasons.
This includes participants from the Chinese American, Indian American, Korean American, and Filipino American communities, as well as organizations representing the education of other Asian American ethnicities such as Hmong, Vietnamese, and Indonesian Americans.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu inquired about a factory building located in Yuzhong Town, Zhejiang Province from the real estate agent. After multiple visits to the site and careful consideration, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu and his family negotiated the details of the house purchase and the ownership rights of the house with the seller, Mr. Lin. After the deal was struck, they transferred the money through the bank and the deposit was made.
When signing as the collector on the "China Factory Buy and Sell Agreement" form, Lin Xiaohu wrote, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties must sign the contract within one week."
However, after discussing the factory sale, payment method, and major contract terms, the two sides failed to reach a consensus, leading to a delay in signing the real estate purchase agreement.
After several days, Lin returned the 20 million yuan deposit to Liu.
It was difficult to see the house in the middle of the road, but the seller had already prepared the money and the contract, so there was nothing left but to sign the agreement, but the seller refused to sell, which made Liu Xinsheng feel helpless and angry.
In response to this, Liu Xinsheng brought a lawsuit against Lin Yuan in the People's Court of Yunmeng City.
The court held that both parties failed to sign a formal contract, and thus the defendant cannot be solely held responsible. It is reasonable to determine that the plaintiff and defendant were in a failed business deal, and thus the case should not be applied to the payment of liquidated damages. The defendant does not have to bear the responsibility of breach of contract.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff initiated an appeal.
Recently, the appeals court has maintained the original verdict.
Attorney's Warning: During the transaction process, you should exercise caution and be mindful of your duties.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should be prudent and attentive to your duties, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property has been occupied by people, and clearly specifying the time and place of payment in the contract to avoid any disputes between the two parties.
After the conclusion of the "People's Forum" in Germany, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, gave a speech on December 11th, 2020, expressing that the United States had organized the "People's Forum" which was "toying with the idea of democracy, weaponizing it, faking democracy, and opposing real democracy, stirring up internal divisions".
The Chinese government regards the United States' long-term efforts to change its political system and value orientation as an attempt to weaken its foundation, promote "color revolutions" and unilateral sanctions, and cause disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become a major interference tool for the United States.
This time, the summit was to show the commitment of the candidates in the election.
The meeting was to be held over two days, with leaders from 111 countries invited, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the SCO summit, China and Russia accused the United States of interfering with the SCO summit and denounced the United States for lacking the qualification to host such a summit.
There are also suspicions of ulterior motives in the international arena, such as criticism of invitation and participation of some authoritarian-leaning leaders, e.g. from Phlippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubt the true intention of the government is not for democracy but for geopolitical purpose of organizing this summit.
The German Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, also attended the video-televised presidential election meeting.
The statement made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, June 13th, 2020, "Today's American-style democracy is evident in its extreme forms of capitalism, personality politics, political polarization, political radicalization, social fracturing, and racial and economic inequality." American democracy is a "rich people's game" built on a capitalist foundation.
During his speech, President Biden expressed, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democracy, promote reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be vigilant against those who put their own interests before the public good.
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation and, in my view, this is the defining challenge of our era."
Biden said, "The challenge of democracy and human rights is an ongoing and daunting one, and it requires champions to defend it."
The United States promised to take action within a year after the Democratic National Convention, including a proposal of a budget of $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy worldwide and provide support to independent news media.
Before the 2022 Winter Olympics, the United States hopes that other countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democracy.
Ban Ki-moon said, "Let us all countries put into practice our commitment and report our progress in the next year."
It's okay, I'm only afraid he sent the wrong address.

It's been so long since I last came to Xiang, but the fruits are still so delicious to drink and the real materials are so tasty to eat! The first time I tried the spicy pancake was my favorite southwestern flavor!
The dumplings were cooked perfectly, with an abundance of filling. The wrapper was crispy and the filling was juicy. The soup was flavorful and the vegetables were cooked just right. The garnishes were also very nice. Overall, it was a delicious meal.
The restaurant's food is delicious, the customer service is enthusiastic, and the meat is good.
The Old Shop in Chang'an has been around for many years, it used to be the hot spot for netizens back then, located in a small alley, it was made of wood and plastic.
The wait for the dumplings was always long, and the dumplings were always burnt to a crisp...
It has been several years since I last visited Chengdu to eat Sichuan cuisine. The variety of small restaurants serving Sichuanese dishes has since become dispersed, with the flow of customers gradually changing.
It was difficult to find a seat even though we had waited in line outside the store. The food quality was bad, and we were unwilling to come back.
The taste of meat is great, and it's a favorite dish.
They are selling goods outside the store.
The food was a bit disappointing this time.
The three bowls of chicken: The vegetables were slightly too much, but the chicken meat was slightly too little.
The taste of this dish is a bit off, the sourness is not enough, so it shows up as sweet and sour, everyone can adjust it in their own way by adding different kinds of flavors and ingredients...
What is the law of drinking alcohol?

The three best ways to drink wine are as follows: the French way, the German way, and the Italian way. Everyone can use these methods as references and try them out. We hope that this introduction from the editor can help you.
Thoughts on Education: How to Make University Examinations Easier for “Examination Superstars” and “Examination Disasters”?The Chinese education system has been undergoing a period of reform and adjustment in recent years. The focus of education has shifted from rote memorization to problem-solving and critical thinking. This has led to a new phenomenon of “examination superstars” and “examination disasters”. Examination superstars are students who have a natural talent for exams and can easily achieve high scores. On the other hand, examination disasters are students who struggle with exams and often receive low scores.In order to make university examinations easier for both examination superstars and examination disasters, it is important to adjust the examination structure and assessment criteria. Examination superstars should be given more challenging questions that require higher-level thinking, while examination disasters should be given simpler questions that require less thinking. This will help to create a more balanced examination environment.In addition, it is important to provide more resources and support for examination disasters. This
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school administration, expressing their frustration with the college entrance exam and proposing measures to make the exam more challenging and transform the test type in order to truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
For a long time, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" in China.
At the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of study, making the learning environment diverse and unique.
Evaluating a group with such diversity of characteristics is difficult, and different sensitivities are involved.
Of course, if the test is too simple and repetitive, the experience will be completely different.
Students who don't use their strengths may be able to achieve good results by focusing on their studies right before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may be able to get better results with half the effort.
When one arrives at this point, “dullness” can be overcome by putting in minimal effort; excellence can be achieved by putting in minimal effort, such as studying, doing homework, and taking notes.
As it appears, the students who took the entrance examination for universities in Lanzhou reflect the problems existing in the examination. However, this is not the case only in Lanzhou.
From this perspective, three students deserve a pat on the shoulder for writing a great essay.
In reality, many people who have passed university exams are clear about the strategies they used to prepare for the exam, such as bribing teachers and attempting to game the system. Even during the exam, they seek remedial instruction from teachers and beg for help. Such cases are not uncommon.
As seen from the perspective of an examiner, the assessment of teaching quality is a directional measure, with the evaluation of student compliance and the comprehensive grasp of teachers on both teaching and learning as the basis. Furthermore, the scientific design of examinations is also based on this.
Entering the university's undergraduate stage, specialization begins, with many specialty courses focusing on the basics.
Doubtfulness is not a suitable attitude when it comes to grasping the basic knowledge points of a certain subject, which is an important content of university exams.
Therefore, the basic knowledge of a college student is mainly composed of scientific theories and basic common sense. From the perspective of knowledge, the space of change is not large, and it is essentially fixed.
Just like what the teacher said 20 years ago, "The basic knowledge of mathematics is still the focus now."
Although the basic knowledge points remain the same, it does not necessarily mean that the test is repetitive.
In many universities, exams usually form topic groups and have the questions collated by subject-experienced teachers, with the exam papers then checked by the entire department of the relevant subject. This helps to reduce the risk of exam questions being repeated to some extent.
However, in order to design a set of tests that are both practical and relevant to the actual learning situation, the topic should be tailored to the students' overall learning conditions, with difficulty levels distributed appropriately. It should also be comprehensive and analytical, enabling the test to be dynamic and well-understood. Furthermore, it should be able to highlight the basic knowledge and skills being tested, as well as assessing the students' capabilities. Finally, it should be innovative and creative in its design.
Exams are the commanding rod of university education, and what kind of exams students take will determine the corresponding preparation strategies they adopt. This will in turn affect the effectiveness of university education.
In regards to the advice letter for students at Lancaster University, the university has highly valued the suggestions and has already implemented a reform plan across the whole campus.
The school should organize teachers to conduct research and evaluation of courses and exams, formulate test questions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of the test process, and refine the grading criteria, in order to enhance the comprehensive evaluation of courses.
To solve the problem of single-type, repetitive questions in university entrance exams, a comprehensive system is needed, but the expertise is expensive and time-consuming. Teachers should have a full understanding of the learning environment and be able to interact with students in a positive way. This will help to create a better atmosphere for learning and make the exam more realistic, thus reducing the pressure of “studying for the sake of exam” and “studying for the sake of grades”.
If I can't change my store location, can I outsource instead?
Do I have to give him second-hand money again?
Colleagues' orders have already been sent.
I didn't reach the finish line.
Where is the GPS? It's not working.
The bride and groom had their wedding photos taken at the South Street Store. However, there is no store division yet.
Because we didn't plan our time properly before taking pictures, we had to change the time twice and the photographer Linda was very patient with us.
Later, he chose a good weekend to take pictures.
The workers of Jin Fujin are highly praised regardless of whether they are beauty consultants or photographers.
That was my first official makeover, wow! I was so scared, but one day I'll look as good as that, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super gentle when it comes to makeup. They also do it very naturally.
We were lucky to have good weather when we were shooting the scenery in the Yangtze River City. The makeup artist was always mindful of our clothing, headwear and accessories, and would adjust them whenever necessary.
The photographer was also very quiet, and felt very happy when taking pictures for a whole day.
When choosing photos for an album, due to seeing many examples online, I didn't want to delete too many photos, but when we were actually choosing photos, there was no thought of adding more photos. We just chose 24 photos and moved on. I was shocked when I heard that the package included one million photos and I was scared that I had chosen too many.
The pictures were edited successfully, and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at them and felt they weren't good enough, so they helped me to re-edit them immediately.
I compared the old photos of my sisters taken before with the new ones I took, and I feel our photos are much better now - simpler, clearer and more stylish.
Real people recommend you to take a look at the wedding photos of Sung Han and her husband!
Package price: 3999 yuan

3200 newborns in Shaanxi Province were found to have been given fake vaccination certificates.
The Yibin Bureau of Vital Statistics said that, due to the special features of the birth certificate, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since October, and the number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, Quanul Amisun assured that all babies who have applied for a birth certificate will be provided with the necessary supplementary documents in due time.
At the press conference, he made an explanation for a 10-month-long issue of a newspaper report on a fabricated story about a celebrity.
He said the problem appeared two months ago and SandRover also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons was that Chinese factories producing counterfeit paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed shipments to our country.
He explained that the paper used for counterfeiting in Saba was different from that in other regions, so it couldn't be used to counterfeit goods from other states.
Quentin Amis revealed the latest batch of fake papers on June 6th, and the printing process was completed on June 8th and handed over to the printing company for partial printing work.

People's Daily commentator: The spirit of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was successfully achieved at the opening of the Central Economic Work Conference.
On December 11th, the People's Daily published an article titled "The Spirit of the 14th and 15th Plenary Sessions of the Central Economic Work Conference". The article discussed the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference and its implications.
The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly evaluated the economic and social development achievements of the past year in China.
Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, delivered an important speech at the 14th National Congress of the CPC, summarizing the economic work in 2021 and analyzing the current economic situation, making major deployments for the economic work in 2022, and pointing out the direction of progress and providing the basic guidance of loyal implementation.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and declare the full completion of the socialist modernization of the nation, and open a new journey of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The 19th National Congress of the CPC was held, summarizing the CPC's 100-year struggle and historic experiences, and formulating the third historic decision of the CPC Central Committee on the CPC's 100-year struggle and historic experiences. This is a political declaration of the Chinese Communist Party to remain true to its original aspirations, persist indefatigably and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is a guide to action, a blueprint for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In the past year, the world has faced a great change and a severe outbreak of the novel coronavirus, making the external environment more complex and posing a great challenge to the global economy and social development.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been persistently adhering to the core of General Secretary Xi Jinping's thought, maintaining stability and making progress in a steady manner, and adjusting the overall tone of the nation and the international situation. It has been tenaciously fighting against the changing circumstances and epidemics, and has been steadily pushing forward the economic and social development. It has been striving to build a new development framework, strengthening macro-control and adjusting the economic and social policies across different periods, and actively promoting economic growth and social progress. It has been tirelessly completing the arduous tasks of reform and opening up, and has achieved remarkable successes for the Party and the nation.
During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the government of O'Pen Village achieved a good start, manifesting in the construction of a new development framework, pushing forward into a new step and gaining a new level of effectiveness in high-quality development.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control has maintained the leading position in the world, with strong, robust and dynamic characteristics continuously displayed; the country's strategic technology strength has been accelerated, major breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of innovation, and the technology innovation capacity has been constantly improved; the industrial chain has been strengthened, exports have been enriched, and structural optimization has been continuously optimized, representing a new growth momentum; the reform and opening up has been deepened, and obstacles to the supply-side structural adjustment and the flow of resources have been broken, creating a new competitive advantage; social security has been strengthened, employment has been expanding, and income growth has been synchronized with economic growth, achieving "double first-class" results; environmental protection has been effectively implemented, and the employment rate has been steadily increasing, with the annual grain harvest continuously staying above 1.3 billion tons, achieving "double first-class" results. China's ecological civilization construction has been continuously promoted, carbon emissions have been reduced, and the low-carbon transformation has been steadily advanced
These results are due to the core leadership of the Party, the result of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism, and the result of the collective effort and hard work of the entire party and the people of all ethnicities.
Practice has once again proven that the CPC has established Xi Jinping as the core of the Party and the core position of the whole Party, thus firmly establishing Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism. This has great significance for the development of the CPC and the nation's history.
Comrade Xi Jinping has been the core of the Party and the whole country since he was appointed General Secretary of the Central Committee. He has been leading the Party and the country with his new era of Chinese socialism and his scientific guidance. With our unity and strength, we will definitely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, and create a brilliant and glorious new era for the modernization of the nation.
The 20th National Congress of the Party will be held next year, which is a major event in the Party and State political life.
Spread the great spirit of the party, persist in the steady and rigorous work style, and constantly advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Perfect, accurate, and comprehensive implementation of the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, quicken the pace of reform and opening up, and promote the modernization of the Party and the country. Strictly control the epidemic and effectively maintain social stability. Continuously improve the quality of economic development, and strive to achieve the "six steady" and "six secure" work. Persist in the steady and healthy economic growth, maintain the reasonable range of economic operation, and ensure the social stability of the country. We will definitely be able to maintain a steady and healthy economic environment, social stability, and a clean and healthy political environment, and achieve outstanding results in the 20th National Congress of the Party.
Let us tightly unite around the core of Xi Jinping Thought and strengthen the four consciousnesses, four self-confidences, and two defenses. We should constantly enhance our political judgement, political expertise, and political execution, so as to turn the Party Central Committee’s decisions into real actions and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The appearance is very good.
After some time, re-evaluate performance.
The machine is fast, better than imagining the size, drenched with the effect of the picture, enjoy, and then use the time to follow up.
It's OK, Hong Kong** is the place to check the machine serial number, the quality should be OK.
It feels like it's heavy, but it's really light. A single hand can't hold it still, but it's a bit bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs smoothly and feels very stable. There's no cardboard sound and the fan is cool. It feels very good and won't be stuck like a gamepad.
The items were very good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and it also came with a backpack, which I thought was very nice.

It's worth it!
The cooling effect is very good, the basic thermal conductivity is low, the thinness degree is convenient for carrying, and the exterior material is classic Thinkpad design, making it comfortable.

I forgot to bring a backpack, so he quickly helped me to buy a new backpack, although it wasn't the original factory backpack, but the customer service was good enough to prove that he was a sincere seller.
If you need to buy a laptop, you can return it and buy a new one.
Display quality: The display is clear and thin, with a good sense of depth. It can be divided into several parts, and the feeling of heaviness is reduced.
The effect of dispersing heat: I began to try it from the beginning, and then evaluate it later.
The keyboard and mouse were sent together with the converter, which was much more practical than the country-specific configuration. Overall, it was quite economical and beautiful. After using it for a while, we can make a fair evaluation of its performance.
This screen is really amazing!
After using it for a while, give it a review!

The State Council has required the implementation of "buffer zone" within 48 hours, emphasizing the strengthening of control over the outbreak of epidemic in coastal cities.
The State Council issued a notice on strengthening infection control work in land border cities (including Hong Kong and Macau) on December 11th, 2020. All personnel who had been to land border cities (including Hong Kong and Macau) should have a negative blood test for COVID-19 within 48 hours after leaving the land border cities. Those who had been to land border cities should also undergo a negative blood test for COVID-19 before entering other cities.
According to the notification, the time frame for determining coastal cities and announcing it is from the date of the notification until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the government has proposed to study the feasibility of setting up a quarantine and control buffer zone in the outskirts of the city.
The National Health and Health Control Committee introduced its responsibilities, and for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, with frequent exchanges between both sides.
Implementing a differentiated management policy for infectious diseases, transforming the border control into two lines, has the potential to relocate the border, compress the outbreak, minimizing social impact, and minimizing social cost.
In recent years, there have been multiple cases of locally-transmittedinfectious diseases in our country, with most of them originating fromforeign countries via ports and coastal cities.
The notification mentioned above pointed out that there were some deficiencies in the timely and effective prevention and control of infectious diseases, such as the personnel of high-risk posts being closed off, the irregular management of biological safety, the lack of regular inspections of laboratories, the inadequate destruction of contaminated items, the inadequate management of confined spaces, and the lack of scientific accuracy in emergency treatment.
Notifications are required from the perfecting of the city's prevention and control system of infectious diseases, strengthening the prevention and warning system, implementing border control measures, and improving the weak links of the city's prevention and control. Stay vigilant and scientifically handle the prevention and control work, tightly seal the border and strengthen the defense line.
Notify and emphasize that all cities along the coast should synchronize their work on epidemic control and public health protection, publish and freely communicate the hotline for public health protection, regularly check the basic living supplies and prices, and actively respond to and reflect the prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the cities specified include open land, water and air ports, as well as the counties (cities, districts, and provinces) where the cities are located, the specific range of which is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, and directly administered cities) according to the needs of prevention and control.

The truth about the Chinese military's 20-year history of spilling blood and guts has been exposed - China News.
(Video Source: Oil Tank)
On December 11th, a short video titled "Killing Machine" on the oil platform caused widespread attention.
This film describes how the United States waged the Afghan War under the banner of "anti-terrorism" to forcibly implant American democracy in Afghanistan for 20 years, committing atrocities, massacres and other inhumane acts.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to vandalize hospitals, schools and other public places, twisting human nature, establishing a murderous gang.
In 20 years, the U.S. military has killed millions of Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has established a "black prison" to punish "enemies" with cruel and humiliating treatment, including physical and mental torture.
The hatred of the people of Afghanistan towards the people of other countries has been further aroused by the crimes they have committed.
Just as the video said, the American "Anti-Terrorism" Conflict escalates further and further.
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to Afghanistan, but only left it with an endless cycle of violence and destruction.
Expose the truth of the bloody terrorist attack in the US, unveil the fake democracy masked by the US!
After casually browsing the internet, I came across this article from a business perspective and from a tax perspective, discussing why this customer wants a tax-free zone logistics company to help them pack boxes, even though packing boxes is not within the scope of their business operations. This article may help to explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many milk powder factories, and touched many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the materials of the pouches and the bottles are the same, without any difference.
Why is the warranty period of a bag with a detachable lining longer than two years, while the warranty period of a bag with a non-detachable lining is only one year?
Why is the price of clothing with different styles and materials so different?
In reality, many consumers, or even mothers, have the opinion that the quality is much better than before due to the different material.
In reality, the value of the material is the same, but people think that what is expensive is good.
Consumers reacted differently after tasting the same product, with some commenting on the aftertaste and others noting the unique flavor.
Now I'm going to tell you the reason why wearing expensive things is considered to be luxurious. Where is it considered to be luxurious?
Why is the price of the same material so different between them?
Since manufacturers consider the cost of packaging when setting prices during the pandemic, consumers have been reluctant to accept them, meaning that manufacturers have low profits or even no profits. What can manufacturers do to survive?
Therefore, they had a great advantage in terms of pricing and were able to secure a large profit margin.
Therefore, most of the factories are promoting the listening earphone rather than the pouch.
Advertising costs for factories each year can range from a few thousand yuan to even tens of millions of yuan. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine and know it.
As society develops, marketing costs are constantly increasing. For example, the cost of promotional staff in shopping centres, the cost of listing fees for products, and advertising costs are all increasing continuously.
Therefore, different factories are constantly introducing new products and the prices are constantly rising. In reality, this is due to the increasing cost of production.
Their ultimate goal is to obtain higher profits, but in reality, their cost of materials may increase by no more than 3-4 yuan.
There are still some branded products, in order to promote their own products, without hesitation, they have attached themselves to hospitals' doctors, to help promote the product, from hearing to earning up to 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
Chinese laws related to consumer protection are absolutely prohibited such operating methods, in fact, this kind of behavior is to cheat consumers.
Before buying a bottle of milk powder, it is suggested to have a storage container at home. This way, you can save money, increase the storage and sealing properties of the milk powder, and there will be no harm to the children.
Even though the durability of a garment is not necessarily better if it is packaged in a garment bag rather than a garment box, if the durability of the garment and the garment bag is the same, the garment bag is easier to be damaged by humidity and temperature changes.
They were late for dinner, and the food was both cold and dry. After that, it was too hard to eat. There was no way they could eat it.

Don't be fooled by the tricksters who try to stop the runners on the starting line.
When shopping for books, you can often feel the explosive success of the genre.
Many successful books and articles today are based on the "best practices" principle — they assume you can "do it" and then tell you what to do.
Equal to saying, "How did we get past 'how to do it'?" This is the most important and fundamental circle.
Since they all have this common trait, they can be translated as follows: If you want to get the best result, you must have a strong determination; If you want to achieve success, you must have a clear goal; No matter what, you must stay focused.
This "best practice" principle will make everyone admit that it is "incomparable to the correct", but 99% of people will be fooled and fall into the trap at the starting line.
Because this kind of thinking can be described as a "you must suffer to reach your goals, rebuild yourself, and make a 180 degree turnaround", it is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who resist change, you must constantly remind them that they must transform, which is clearly an act of self-deception and exploitation.
Most people will be hesitant before the change, with their feet dragging and their heart wavering; or they may be energized by a short-lived surge of emotion, but eventually they will fall into the same trap, unable to sustain the momentum.
The renowned classical piece "From the Beginning" from the film "Cecilia" was performed by Jackie Chan, which portrayed the "Universal Humanity" in a most spiritual way.
The greatest challenge of the "Golden Rule" is that it often exceeds the capacity of the average person, leaving most people feeling helpless and frustrated.
Perhaps, “Following the Golden Rule” is one of the paths that can make success more accessible to the average person.
The core principle of "doing better than before" is based on the idea of "reducing friction" — — it encourages a "little wins lead to big wins" mentality, where even if you don't reach 100%, just doing 1% more is still better than doing nothing at all.
No matter what you do, if you do it with all your might, you will be much stronger than those who do nothing.
Since the difficulty of the task decreased significantly, it became more likely for ordinary people to persist indefatigably, and thus the probability of success would also increase.
Only by following the "successful principles" can one achieve success, and the road is often long and winding.
Although “Best Practices” may appear to be a successful flag for everyone, it is ultimately able to inspire only a few; whereas “Second Best Practices” can effectively motivate more people, allowing for maximum benefit.

The amount of resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake will increase by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 11.4%. - Xinhua Net
Reporters from the Xinhua News Agency in Ningxia visited the fishing village of Xiaoyangshan in Qinghai Province on December 11th and learned that the latest monitoring results showed that the total amount of fish in the Qinghai Lake had increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, 40 times more than the initial protection in 2002.
The famous "flatfish" in the Qinghai Lake is a special fish species unique to the lake, playing an important role in safeguarding and diversifying the ecological chain and biological diversity of the Qinghai Lake watershed.
During the 60s and 70s of the last century, overfishing, habitat degradation and other factors caused the number of fish in the Qinghai Lake to decline sharply. In 2002, the total catch of Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Red Data Book listed the Qinghai Lake Monster as an endangered species.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has been implementing the ban on fishing in the Qinghai Lake and its surrounding river and tributaries, as well as prohibiting any unit, group or individual from catching, buying or selling the fish and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial breeding, releasing flow and cleaning Qinghai Lake's main inlet and outlet rivers, as well as designing scientific and rational fish passages, have been taken to increase the protection level of the lake gradually.
In the city of Kunming, the vice director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, Yang Lin, introduced the progress of the artificial breeding and release program for the endangered fish, which has exceeded 23% contribution rate to the resource recovery of the lake.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Three River Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source in China, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and functional area that helps to slow down the westward expansion of the desert.
In order to protect the Three Gorges, Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau ecosystems, the water and wildlife of the area, the government has been issuing warnings about the Long River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake Special Protection Areas since 2018. This has resulted in the construction of a comprehensive ban on fishing and hunting in the area.

The restaurant only gave me a bag, which I had to stuff with items and put it in the bag. The weather was cold.
Do you mean that the goods are stored in a bag?

Give unknowing men a health check.
Most girls will experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13 and 15, and will be able to close their period around the age of 50.
After ensuring good health of the body, one can compare the monthly cycle more regularly.
But it is not always the case that the forecast is accurate; it is usually necessary to prepare in advance, and sometimes the mood can change suddenly (for example, a few days in advance).
The duration, amount and severity of pain vary from person to person; some people need three days of rest, some need a week; some have little blood loss, some have a lot; some have no reaction, some need help from a car or ambulance to move; the pain will change with time, and it doesn't represent the same person's pain.
During the 24 hours within which the full moon is at its peak, the only thing one can do is to use a sanitary napkin or a piece of clean cloth to stop the bleeding and prevent it from reaching the clothes.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins, which begins right before your period and peaks during your period. Eating brunch can help relieve the cramps, but there's not much else you can do after the cramps have started.
Due to excessive release of blood and hormones from the uterus before delivery, it is easy to have a bulging belly.
If you reach your period, it's not a big deal. You can just take a few days off and everything will be fine.
Changing a hygiene towel every three hours can prevent bacteria from multiplying, so it is better to replace it after two or three hours. If you don't change it, the worst case is to change it six times a day, which is equivalent to 42 pieces a month. If you add the pieces prepared in advance, it may reach up to 50 pieces a month.
(This requires a single change of bandages, which usually lasts about five to six hours, but can last up to eight hours.)
During the full moon and the period of menstruation, the chance of experiencing strong emotions is higher, and the mood may be unstable due to hormonal changes. This can be very overwhelming, and it can be difficult to take care of yourself.
Although official crime rate data can reveal the ability of women to control their emotions, it will never be able to solve the problem of emotional issues.
The fluid is not only blood, but also contains endometrial tissue.
After the end of the monthly cycle, the lining of the uterus becomes thicker, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus preparing to receive guests, but since there are no guests, it is eventually demolished. The cycle then starts again the next month.
Monthly menstruation is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with blood flowing for 24 hours per month, and still causing abdominal pain and back pain. Who would want this?
However, people are able to be born due to their mother's hard work during the month of pregnancy, which is to prepare for their first visit to this world. We should thank our mother for their hard work and healthy pregnancy.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed by society, which portrayed them as lewd and shamed them. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that preparing for pregnancy and childbirth is an evil thing, they shouldn't speak out in public, especially when there are many people around. The girls should stand up, they have never experienced it before and the boy won't go through it either. They shouldn't forget their duty and be unjust to their own mother. How could they think of such a thing?
Finally, give it a try with health care cloths, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, making people more disappointed than usual.

Is the electricity leaking from the foot bath?
Choosing the suitable foot bath can bring you good health effects. Today, the National Beauty Small Editor will answer this question and hope to help friends.
As people's health awareness has been enhanced, the popularity of bath tubs has been increasing rapidly among consumers. On the market, a variety of bath tubs with different prices from a few dozen to thousands of yuan have been presented, providing consumers with a great selection space.
On related data tables, compared with traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as saunas and steamers have seen a boom in sales, but saunas lack special industry standards, resulting in a certain safety risk.
“It's too dangerous to swim in the electric water with a battery!”
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his parents on their birthday, but his parents felt uncomfortable when they tried to take a bath in it.
When Mr. Li first started using the vibrating function of the bath tub, he didn't expect it to cause such a stir. He was shocked when the vibrating function was suddenly turned off and he felt a strange sensation in his feet. His father said it was like a massage.
Mr. Li tried using an electric brush, but to his surprise, the brush lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to find that the water in the bathtub was carrying electricity.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had to give up the massage chair and the sauna. Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that the industry had no clear specifications for the bath tub, such as its temperature setting, target audience, and material safety, it is now set at the highest temperature and is applicable to any people and any material to ensure safety.
However, even in general circumstances, a wash basin with a plug will not have any electricity-related problems, but it still cannot be excluded that some products may have loose connections during the manufacturing process.
Therefore, when purchasing a bath tub, one should choose a freestanding model.
Separating water and electricity can cause no safety hazards.

The 13th China Tea Expo opened in Wenzhou - Vision Point - Hunan Daily - Wenzhou Edition - China Voice Online
On December 10th, the Hunan Daily reported that the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and the Introduction of Newly-Processed Red Tea was held in the Hunan International Expo Center. The event showcased the tea industry, introduced new tea technologies, and spread the tea culture, accelerating the growth of the tea industry.
The China National Supply-Side Cooperation Leading Group Vice-Chairman Huang Xunli and the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee Vice-Chairman Yao Hong were present at the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu from the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced the origin of the Red Tea at the opening ceremony and infused the new energy into the “Five-Colored Xiang Tea”.
In recent years, the provincial and municipal governments have provided strong support to the tea industry, promoting the construction of the billion-dollar Chaoshan tea industry, forming the "Three Teas and Five Colors" development scenario.
The tea industry in the province has seen great innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main forces driving the development of the tea category. The tea-growing region is pushing for tea tourism and integration, leading to a boom in tea production and consumption.
The wind changed direction, and the red tea gained strength again.
According to the tea expert, after harvesting green tea, red tea and black tea, the value of the tea garden will keep on rising.
At the ceremony, the company was granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark and joyfully celebrated the "source of the Hunan Red Tea".
At the New Tea Expo Hall in Fujian, a renowned tea merchant from China saw a special kind of tea called "Ice Cream Tea" from the high mountain region. He immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, the secretary-general of the Tea Industry Association, said at the Tea Expo that the market situation of tea leaves was affected by various factors, but on-site observations showed that the highlights of the Tea Expo were still prominent.
A cup of freshly brewed red tea, injected with the essence of the tea culture, brings a warm and vibrant atmosphere, stimulating business and exchange of energy. The arrival of the spring season is welcomed with great joy.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

The problem of studying mathematics is not to be solved directly through intuition and feeling, but rather to be approached through logical reasoning and deduction.
Existentialism is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The phrase “Form and Emptiness” is a translation from the Chinese text “Yi Jing•Xie Jing” in the “Form and Emptiness” chapter. It was translated into Japanese by Dogen (1200-1253 CE) and became popular in the Meiji period.
The branches of philosophy include the study of the body, natural theology, and its extension questions.
The essence of this ontology is to study what kind of words represent the true existence of entities, and what kind of words are just representations of concepts.
Materialism denies the existence of God.
Chomsky's Theory is based on the concept that all phenomena can be explained using natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
Thus, the method of studying God without using any words is the research method of natural theology.
The essence of psychology and philosophy is the study of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two main schools of thought regarding the relationship between spirit and matter are dualism and materialism.
Knowledge philosophy is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the scientific study and reflection of human morality and behavior in everyday life; it includes all rules accepted by people and cultures.
Ethics can be divided into two main branches: abstract ethics (the study of ethical principles or moral criticism) and applied ethics (the evaluation of different moral views and providing advice on right or wrong behavior).
People should follow the ethical standards set by the research. Ethics, which includes biomedical ethics and political ethics, should be applied to real life situations. Finally, a description of ethics should be made by gathering information about people's lifestyles and summarizing the observed styles.
It is not from a priori reasoning that it starts, but from actual observation of the moral agent's choices and the real-world constraints that these choices entail. It discusses the moral factors of the society, such as the moral agent's choices and the real-world constraints that these choices entail.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
The first part of the lecture is about the moral philosophy of humanism, represented by Walter Benjamin and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
The second part of the lecture focused on the moral philosophy of religious reform, with Karl Marx as an example.
Part Three: Political Ethics, Represented by Mencius, Xu Zhangrun, and Other Modern Chinese Thinkers; Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Experience Ethics, Represented by Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, and Other European Enlightenment Thinkers; 19th century, French Rationalism Ethics, Represented by Emmanuel Kant and Other French Thinkers; 18th-19th century, German University Ethics, Represented by Immanuel Kant and Other German Thinkers; 18th-19th century, British Utilitarianism Ethics, Represented by John Stuart Mill and Other British Thinkers; 18th-19th century, German Idealism Ethics, Represented by Friedrich Schiller and Other German Thinkers; 19th century, British Pragmatism Ethics, Represented by William James and Other American Thinkers; 19th century, German Neo-Kantianism Ethics, Represented by Wilhelm Windelband and Other German Thinkers; 19th century, British Analytic Ethics, Represented by G.E. Moore and Other British Think
Logic is the study of "efficient inference and proof" as the principles and standards of a scientific discipline.
Formal Logic typically includes three parts: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and inferential logic, which can be divided into propositional logic and non-propositional logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the essence and meaning of beauty as the main topic of research.
The money has been delivered, it is food that has been ordered.
The name of the animal is Gongbao, born in the Year of the Sheep, living on grassland, and thusly known as "Sheep Grandpa".

He claims to be "Expertly Narrating Eight Paths of Bizarre Stories".

Ding Zilin: Devoted to the people.
Throughout the 30 years since the disaster, my family and I have been deeply grateful for the unconditional help from all of you. In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those who have been providing continuous assistance since 1994 when I issued a public appeal for help. Your help has never been interrupted.
Nowadays, many elderly parents have already passed away, leaving the orphans to grow up and find jobs.
Your kindness has helped us pass through the most difficult time of our lives.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, most donors have stopped donating.
Therefore, I humbly request you to kindly stop giving us hard time——the Mothers of the Motherland in Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian rescue activity should be started as soon as possible.
I will forever engrave your love in my heart and your loyalty in my memory. It is a historical inevitability that your deeds will be forever engraved in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to use this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the International Foundation for China Social Services (IFCSS) and the Minority Development Fund (MCDF).
During the process of engaging in human rights assistance, the China Democracy and Human Rights Fund and the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association are parallel organizations, with project implementers often having to cross paths.
The Apple Daily published a picture of the Temple of Heaven Mother Goddess Web Site, with the responsibility of the Taoist to clean it.
Donation is always difficult to be sent to the victims of the June 4th massacre.
In 1994, with the advice of Ding Ling, a special group was founded to receive and distribute relief funds, called the “Tiananmen Mothers”.
In 1998, MCDF established the "Sixth-April Orphan Education Fund", and has been executing it for 11 years. In 2009, MCDF further established the "Sixth-April Orphan Hardship Relief Fund" and has been carrying it out until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from altruistic donations and generous contributions from individuals during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, as well as receiving support from the University's Democratic Fund.
From 2018 onwards, we have received the support of the Labor and Workplace Research Fund.
After 31 years, the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the event.
During this period, China Rights Forum also implemented their humanitarian rescue projects independently.
We understand that teacher Ding called for a stop to the donation on June 4th, as he was considering the donors, and we are indeed retired people with limited income, thus appreciate his understanding of us.
We will respect the decision of the vulnerable populations and terminate this project within two years, and resume it as needed.
For those who have been enduring great pain and suffering for many years, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our deepest gratitude and respect.

If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to go and get trained, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, since the cost of training is very expensive and it takes 6 months of time to study.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a good choice, especially for those who lack self-motivation and strength. Training is a great choice for them.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to study on your own, but it will be quite tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First, we need to look at the teacher qualification level of this institution. If the teacher qualification level is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions also do not have special strength in teacher qualification.
Before selecting this training institution, it is advisable to explore it in detail. Knowing the students of this institution can give a better idea of what it is like. After all, only the students of this institution can tell us what it is really like. Furthermore, the course offered by the institution can be assessed as good or bad.
Hi, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your personal situation. There is a big connection between learning this thing and personal situation.
For example, profession, age, language, even in which city, these will be related to the industry you are studying or wanting to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many online and offline training institutions which are not bad, but it requires a high investment of time and money, and it also requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is my own situation, self-study is very convenient, since there are many free resources on the internet, such as videos, articles, and tutorials. You can also go to b station for more training resources. If you can't find resources, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources. You can also ask for detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video-based learning.
If you are not majoring in computer science, but are willing to pay certain tuition fees and time costs, then it is advisable to attend a training institution to learn. This way of learning does not require much effort and the teacher explains in great detail, with problems also being answered by specialized personnel. In addition, there is help in planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions nowadays sign job contracts, provide references, and recommend companies after the training, thus saving a lot of time during the job hunting process.
This is just my general views as I didn't understand your situation fully. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I saw the app 1 point before I arrived.
What is it called?
You haven't finished talking yet. What are you doing?
This person provides a variety of services, such as installation, cleaning, maintenance, water heater, dryer, furnace, chimney, vacuum cleaner, lighting fixture, and glass polishing.
I would like to express my appreciation to those people who have silently given me encouragement, for their effort and persistence in life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
People who put in effort will never be disappointed in life. Those who love me will show their appreciation in their own way. Thank you to those who are silent but show their appreciation with a nod or a smile.
Life is like that, people only see the results, but they don't know the process, facing life, we are strong and keep going, there is no choice, but we can turn around and walk back……

Hope you can start a new and happy day from the early morning. Wish you bring happiness, luck, health and positive mind to the journey. Have a good morning and keep the positive mood all day long. Good night.
As children, happiness is something we can possess; as adults, it's a goal to strive for; and as we mature, we realize it's a state of mind that can be attained.
Strive to be the most authentic and virtuous version of yourself, walk with courage and no regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life is composed of two treasures: a healthy body and a clear mind, shining brightly until old age!
At different stages of life, people will encounter different challenges.
At many times, your courage to face difficulties was not your ability, but rather a positive attitude.
Since you cannot avoid it, it is better to face it directly.
As you become more afraid, you will be more difficult to be defeated. If you face difficulties, the problem will eventually be resolved.
Chinese curators helped organize the first-ever Shaanxi Contemporary Art Biennale - New China Net.
The China News Agency held the first ever Diliya Art Exhibition on 12th December in Liyang, China. 64 artists from China and Saudi Arabia participated in the exhibition. Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guang from Diliya jointly presented the exhibition.
This exhibition is jointly organized by Sotheby's and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, with UCCA's Director Tania Wang as the curator.
The team introduced the theme of the exhibition, "Feeling Stones Over the River", which reflects the reform strategies adopted in the current period of social and economic transformation in Saudi Arabia and its cultural development.
This exhibition occupies over 12,000 square meters of space, with six interconnected buildings showcasing : 《Smoke and Mirrors》 《Inheriting the Experiment》 《Thinking of the Edge》 《Going Public》 《Beauty and New World》 《Exploring the Spirit of Art》.
Of the 27 Saudi Arabian artists featured in the exhibition, 40% of their works account for the total number of works on display. The works include painting, installation, and performance art in various forms; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, with some using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in his series of "Stories from the Mountains" (2014), which reconstructed a classic mountain-and-water painting with discarded objects.
Deyan Bakri, the Chairman of the Expo 2020 Dubai Supreme Organizing Committee, expressed his hope that the Expo 2020 will be able to establish an international dialogue and provide global audiences with the opportunity to learn about the cultural and creative industries and the interactive community of the UAE.
Tian Fei Yu said, "The goal of the biennale is double-fold, to allow for a dialogue between contemporary art from Saudi Arabia and the global art world, as well as to allow for a deeper engagement of the audience with contemporary art from Saudi Arabia."
During the Double Ninth Festival, a series of lectures will be held, inviting art experts, curators and creative industry leaders to share their insights on cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Regulating and Standardizing Rural Employment Positions - China News
The New China News Agency reporter Li Bin visited the poverty-stricken areas in Kaili, Guizhou Province, on December 12th to help the local people find jobs and promote the revitalization of the rural areas. The provincial government has also taken various measures to strengthen the management of rural public welfare positions and promote the revitalization of rural areas.
The person in charge of the rural work unit in Yunnan Province is responsible for developing 44.83 million public-benefit jobs in rural areas, which are used to secure employment for the impoverished population, strengthen their resilience in poverty alleviation, and enhance the public service capabilities in various aspects.
This "New Rules" was jointly issued by the State Council, Human Resources, Agriculture, Rural Affairs, Finance, and Civil Affairs Departments to unify the regulations on recruiting, managing, and developing positions for rural villagers in the public sector. The main objectives are to standardize the scope of recruitment, fund management, position development, and position management.
In terms of development and setting of the workplace, the new regulations are clear, in accordance with "setting posts according to needs, assigning people to posts, dynamic management, total control" principles. Who is responsible for development, who is responsible for use, and who is responsible for the post? The principle of "one person one post, voluntary openness, unified management" should be followed in setting.
Recruitment process must be followed in the order of announcement, application, screening, offer, hiring, onboarding and training.
In addition, the new regulations have made clear the specific responsibilities of the village-level public interest positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing village-level public interest positions, and the requirements for village-level public interest position staffing, such as purchasing accident insurance for village-level public interest position staff. The relevant departments should periodically supervise and inspect the subsidies for village-level public interest positions.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I placed a new order.
Is the event cancelled?
Second, although the Rightists had a short-lived glory in history, it was due to the fact that they exposed themselves to the sunlight and drank the water, which made them sweat profusely; thus, they were easily defeated and crushed by the powerful forces of the State.
Although the real situation is still far from satisfactory, the right-wing has made positive contributions to the social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, the true meaning of reality should be defined and standards set for economic growth, technological progress and political system reform and human rights protection. The positive meaning of the right-wing should not be denied.
Although I don't agree with everything Li Weidong says, I'm very interested in his views, and very respectful of him as a person. This is because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere in his views on Chinese social issues.
But I disagree with his anti-communist views, as I believe any anti-communist movement will inevitably lead to social unrest, economic hardship and political disorder.
To change or improve China, one must have a tenacious and responsible attitude, not a reckless and opportunist one, like a chicken trying to grab a hot potato.
Let's chat some more.
Left, in reality, is a relic of the past and politics.
If right-wing ideas have positive social implications, the Communist Party will listen to them and analyze their thoughts when needed. Without the right-wing ideas to criticize, the left has nothing to counteract.
I recently saw some of my friends looking sad and angry, and they also seemed to be feeling unwell. I thought they might not need my help.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all just a bunch of nonsense.
We don't have to try to prove that we are right, and we don't have to think about making the counter-revolutionaries and the left-wing admit their mistakes, do we?
I tell my friends this way: When your left foot is itchy and your right dog is barking, it proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but later in life they either forgot their dreams or pursued them wrongly.
As one dreams and journe Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalA new public artwork has been unveiled at Antrim Area Hospital.The artwork, which is located in the hospital’s main entrance foyer, was created by local artist, David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture made from steel and aluminium and is inspired by the hospital’s history and the surrounding landscape.The artwork was commissioned by the Health and Social Care Board as part of its Public Art Strategy.The aim of the strategy is to enhance the environment for patients, staff and visitors by providing artworks which are both aesthetically pleasing and therapeutic.
Left or right, I think China should be left-leaning due to its history and cultural genes.
The right-wing in China emphasizes freedom, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and fairness, as well as security.
In the current society, people should pay more attention to fairness, while there is a conflict between China and the US. It is certain that the left-leaning tendency will continue for many years.
Although I couldn't understand it, I still gave it a thumbs up.
Nothing to say, flower is just like this.
For the past two years, the US has been restricting and obstructing the sales of Huawei's core components, not only putting Huawei into a worse situation than before, but also causing immense losses to US-based companies.
The US government has been pressuring China's semiconductor industry by requiring domestic enterprises and related companies to simultaneously lock down the Chinese semiconductor industry, resulting in a direct impact on global semiconductor supply chain orders and profits. This has caused a decrease in the research and development investment of semiconductor enterprises, as well as a decrease in production capacity, resulting in a shortage of the global semiconductor supply chain.
The "Chip shortage" has already spread to various industries around the world, such as car manufacturers' production halt and mobile phone price hike, affecting almost all industries that use chips.
In order to gain control of the "chip" industry, more and more countries are embarking on the road of "beautification" of technology.
In order to gain control of the global semiconductor industry, the US is pulling the strings of the Chinese semiconductor industry's development, recently inviting the US to host the "Chip Summit" and offering financial aid to maintain its domestic semiconductor giants, such as Intel and AMD.
Most people will take it for granted that the Taiwanese will make a strong resistance against the Chinese, and it is likely to cause a great impact on the Taiwanese power grid.
This is because Intel, the old giant in the semiconductor industry, has been investing in the Chinese market for decades and has accumulated a large number of talents and technological reserves, which must ensure its rapid rise and defeat Taiwan in a short period of time.
However, regarding Intel's decision, Taiwan Semiconductor's founder Zhang Zhi-Ming still showed no regret.
At the 2021 Teacher's Cup Forum, Zhang Chongtu's blunt speech about the factory built by Intel and Foxconn caused a stir, with many people openly discussing the issue.
Zhang Chung-Mao's determination to invade the chip market was fueled by his long-standing grudge against Intel.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the shining star of the US semiconductor industry, occupying the global peak, and becoming the undisputed champion of the worldwide semiconductor industry.
Throughout the 80s, the semiconductor industry was dominated by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode, with chip design, manufacturing and packaging completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model puts some small businesses in an unfavorable position, as many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only watch the large-scale production line construction cost go up without being able to afford it.
After feeling the market demand, the chip industry began to appear in the 80s, and the cooperation of subcontracting began to emerge. In 1984, Zhang Chung-Ming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in the production of chips.
In a few years, Zhang Chuangmu's idea became a reality, with Taiwan becoming a leader in the development of renewable energy.
Tai Chin Electric has narrowed its focus to the jewelry-making business, refusing to design and only providing custom-made jewelry services.
When Intel was just a small startup, it was already a giant in the technology industry.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chung-Mao had been actively seeking investment from Intel, but Intel was reluctant to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor due to its limited understanding of the chip industry's manufacturing ecosystem. Intel thought it was too risky and declined to invest.
Zhang Chung-Ming also acknowledged that Intel was not paying attention to the glass-making process at the time.
I never expected that the giant of Glass processing services would be so popular nowadays.
Therefore, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when Intel entered the Chinese market.
Taiwan's chip industry has now surpassed Intel.
Faced with the powerful challenge from Taiwan, Intel also dare not be passive and complacent.
Now, TSMC has already moved on to 3nm chips, while Intel is still developing 14nm chips.
It is not easy to exceed one's own expectations.
He didn't wait.
I placed the order at 7:06 PM and it was completed in 2 hours.
Today, let's take a look at some [weird] search engine results.
What is normal emotional behavior?
After the three hot topics of the month of February: the Dragon Boat Festival, the Goods Price Increase, and the Crazy Rich Asians Event, the emotional wave spread and formed a peak, then followed by a smooth decline (a curved line). If the second wave of emotion is generated, it will have a small hump again.
It looks like the emotional intelligence model displayed on the website is different from the one they have seen before.
What is the emotion of abnormality?
Six hot spots were randomly chosen from the same event, presenting a [Mountain Peak] shape, a [Fang Shape] shape, and a [Cliff Face] shape.
When the topic heats up, individuals rush to join in, causing a rapid rise in the temperature of the discussion; when the topic cools down, the group withdraws, ensuring the topic is properly handled and leaving room for new tasks and battles.
In the graph, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another, at the same time and with no difference in seconds. It is certain that the united forces will accept the new mission and launch a new offensive.
You can see the professionalization of black hat activities is visible in the rise of several dozen hot topics on the same list, such as which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for profits, which ones are sparking offensive and defensive strategies, which ones are transferring the viewpoint, which ones are influencing the cognition, which ones are leading to wrong judgments, which ones are arousing emotions, and which ones are wrapping up the strategies, such as targeting accounts, segmenting the nodes, and refining the operations in a fine-grained manner, almost considering all the elements involved in the spread of emotions.
Transmission is a science, opening up a new perspective, involving emotional and subjective factors, as well as objective data, even black propaganda will be exposed.
No matter how far we go, we will leave behind traces of our journey. Such traces, we can unearth together.
The data source is a Hot Search Time Machine.
Mauritius discovered the first case of Escherichia coli infection- China News

I received money.
The order was a fowl.
Good, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# made a phone call to your staff and explained it.

360° Integrated Home Furnishing
Address: 156 Huancheng South Road, Happy Garden 12th Floor
Because of trust, I first introduced my friends. Therefore, I chose to take a look at the basic renovation budget of 7 million.
When they arrived at the store, they began a series of scams.
I only showed them my floor plan and they didn't even bother to come to the site to measure the house. Nevertheless, they were able to give me an approximate price of my 135 sqft house which is 7 million. They didn't even know what brand of material they were using.
Their second scam is that they will entice you to come to the store with the promise of a discount, but once you're there they will try to extort money from you.
When depositing money in Wuxi, they will invite their manager to tell you. If you deposit the money today, you will get a great discount.
This is an example of being cheated out of a lot of money. I was so angry that my head was spinning. In the end, I lost a million dollars.
He gave me a price of 7 million without including water and electricity bills, nor any doors and cupboards, nor bathroom.
Their service fees are much higher than other companies' fees.
I lost trust in this company and didn't know what to expect at the beginning. So I just signed the contract without making things clear.
When I went to look for them to return the money, they displayed a very experienced mannerism, with a specialized team to face you.
Regardless of how it happened, the customer's problem was ultimately their own fault. They had no right to blame anyone else.
Each friend found various fees, didn't want to calculate them all, and later gave you an estimate of the costs.
The original dragon costumes were made to fool people, but now they have all been shut down and changed to something else.
Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing such shoddy construction companies.
After everyone had chosen, they looked at the questions and answers many times to make sure they had chosen correctly. This was because the cost of the renovation was not little money.

This is so scary, it took 30 minutes to get through the horror! Please cancel your order!
Is there any other way? For example, changing the address?
That's great, you don't have to cancel the conversation, if you don't return the item within 5-10 days, I'll pursue it.
Can I cancel the order after 15 minutes?
The chicken should be cooked, but it was fresh meat, so there was no way to eat it.
The sky is preparing for a huge shower of stars, mesmerizing people on the 14th day.
On December 12th, 2018, the renowned Chinese astronomer Professor Zhou Runcheng gave a special introduction to the audience at the New China News Agency in Tianjin. He shared his knowledge about the last and most grandiose meteor shower of the year, the Twin Zeta Ursid meteor shower, which will be arriving on the night of December 14th. Those who are fond of meteor showers can observe it after the night.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing spotted a double rainbow in the sky on December 13, 2018.
Most of the periodic comets that bring us meteor showers are members of the Solar System's Oort cloud, but the mother of the meteor shower called the Lyrids is a 3200-numbered asteroid called 698 Aph2.
The second known meteor shower is the Zodiac Rain, which is not from the Zodiac Wheel but from a star.
The Chairman of the Astronomy Club of Tianjin, Peng Xin, gave a speech on the similarities between the Hengyuan meteor shower and the Zodiac sign of the Double Star. According to Peng, the Hengyuan meteor shower usually appears in the last two weeks of December, and can be seen from the 4th to the 17th.
This meteor shower is renowned for its large flow rate and stable performance. It is often compared to the Chinese constellation of the same name, and is one of the three great meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
The most prominent feature of the Twin Star Cluster is its slow star speed, vivid colors, and abundance of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Astronomy lovers in Tianjin, Yang Jing, on December 13th, 2020, captured a double rainbow satellite in the Zodiac constellation.
The meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14th, 2020 at 15:00 UTC, with a ZHR of 150. (Under ideal viewing conditions, the number of meteors visible per hour is 150.)
Recommend a star chart showing the rainfall.
Last year, the Double-Zeta Rains left a deep impression on people, but this year's Double-Zeta Rains will be affected by the Moonlight Interference, resulting in a slightly reduced level of spectacularity.
On the 14th day of the lunar month, the moon is in its full phase, shining brightly and causing interference to observing the sky. It will start to get dark in the later half of the night and the radiation point of the Double Star will be higher than before.
Friends who enjoy watching the stars and rain can observe the celestial show for up to three hours after the moonfall, but should be aware of the cold and take measures to stay warm.
How can we observe more stars efficiently?
It is not advisable to observe the stars in the city, but you can select a high, bright, and open viewpoint facing east in the rural areas or suburbs, and wait patiently for the moon to fall before enjoying the view.
The radiation from the Double Star system is very strong in all directions. When observing, you don't need to keep staring at the Double Star system's radiation point.
Your friends who love photography should think of taking starry night sky photos with a wide angle lens and a high ISO setting.
Considering stability and durability, a three-legged stool, a battery backup, and an emergency power line must be indispensable.
Peng Teh warned him.
What differences are there between LED TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
Through my understanding, the traditional television that the host mentioned should be referring to liquid crystal television, while the difference between plasma and liquid crystal televisions in the market positioning mainly consists of two points: 1. Plasma televisions are generally more expensive than liquid crystal televisions. 2. Plasma televisions have better picture quality than liquid crystal televisions, but liquid crystal televisions have better energy efficiency.
First, LED TVs have become more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the wide market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TV is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of LED TVs is usually 75 inches or above, with the maximum size exceeding 100 inches, meeting the needs of users for large-screen televisions.
In recent years, the global demand and sales of laser TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV market size of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of the Chinese market, the LED TV market will continue to grow rapidly in 2020, with a growth rate of over 140%.
The excellent performance of the laser TV in the eye protection department is the main reason for its good performance in the large-screen market.
Based on the principle of imaging by reflection of laser beams, the light emitted from the laser source is not directly incident on the eye, compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
Researchers from the Chinese Electronics Standardization Research Institute and Beijing Eye Hospital ophthalmologists conducted a strict comparison experiment by viewing laser and liquid crystal televisions under the same conditions. The experiment yielded 144 data sets.
Data Verification: Laser TV indeed has very strong eye protection, even in certain aspects it has certain improved effect.
In the face of increasing attention to eye health, laser TVs have not only benefited from the advantages of protecting eyes, but have also opened up a new breakthrough in the color TV market.
The second generation of LED TVs has focused more on the high-end market.
Contrasting the constantly dropping price of LCD TVs, the price of currently available LED TVs is still in the thousands of dollars, as the size and light source have been upgraded, resulting in a gradual increase in price.
What is the price of this expensive laser TV?
It is certain to be rational.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has the advantages that LCD TV and projection can't achieve.
Thanks to advanced short-focus projection technology, the distance between the projector and the screen can be much shorter than that of traditional projection systems, allowing for a 100-inch large-screen experience in a small space with a small host and minimal footprint.
In terms of brightness, branded LED TVs can reach a maximum of 2000 nits.
Adding more power to the device will reduce its temperature, causing less damage to the device and extending the life of the TV.
In addition to 4K ultra-high-definition visuals, many high-end laser TVs also come with advanced features such as artificial intelligence systems, immersive sound, and more. This can provide users with an even more exhilarating visual and audio experience.
Don't let fake demand fool you, but dividing the demand can help product development in various forms, prepare well for investment and help strengthen the output ratio, laser TV is not a gaming console for viewers, consider the large screen and viewing environment beforehand, you can try, all things have their own advantages and disadvantages, weighing the pros and cons after all.
A simple explanation, wide angle lens is close to the focus of the projector--laser TV, in order to attach to the screen, must use expensive wide angle lens and reflective mirror, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To protect against part of the environment light, using the fabric of the Phipps's net, the price is high, 80 inches can be exchanged for 65 inches of liquid crystal.
There is still one point I want to emphasize. When you are selling the projector, you should be extra careful about the light from the projector shining onto the screen. The light is direct light and the eyes can't see it. Even if you mirror the light onto the TV, the eyes still can't see it. Is the TV really bright enough to be lit up?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not anti-glare, it will be useless.
The hot spot effect of the curtain was ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from one corner. That was really difficult to bear.
The store is specialized in photography and video equipment. It is currently looking for quality products.
After adding a date to my WeChat appointment, my girlfriend quickly arranged the available time and replied the message promptly.
Before entering the store, I had a look at the photographs taken inside. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The shooting style involved various angles and perspectives.
After having simple conversations with my little sister, I tried two different outfits and finally settled on the one that suited my style. The photographer then set up the makeover and posed me accordingly.
Although I haven't had specific conversations with her about photography, the photos I took weren't the style I wanted. However, they still look good.
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, and there will be a good communication afterwards. It will be a stylish and meticulous selection of photos.
The movie was supposed to take half a month to finish, but it ended up taking much longer than that.
The King's Feast activity of the Photography class was held again. Everyone was able to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed.
He finally chose a black blazer, experiencing a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer is a 95-year-old brother, who feels slightly bored and has a bit of a green complexion. He hopes to give more advice in the future after the customer shooting action. The shooting process is quite enjoyable.
This store specializes in high-quality photography and video equipment. It is the best choice for photographers and videographers.
After you visited the homepage, you can also come to check out Queenie~
First, I filled in my name and phone number. Then I chose clothes, veil and makeup. The service was patient and the atmosphere was good. After that, I posed for a while and the photographer taught me how to pose. The result was amazing, it looked like I had double eyebrows! After a month, I received the photos. It was almost the same as the original one.
The environment overall is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
There are three makeup stations near the photography backdrop.
The service was very passionate, but also very attentive.
The instructor was very patient.
The photographer will be very attentive to your actions and help you find the best poses.
If you are not comfortable with it, the photographer may offer to retouch the photo.
Experience has shown that the eyes may have become slightly crossed, the original double eyelid having been replaced by a triple one.
Even my eyebrows were shaved off, which made me feel a bit awkward for everyday without makeup.
After taking a picture, the result was not satisfactory. It felt like the picture had a double-exposure effect, which was very obvious.
After trying two styles, the result was that she chose the black suit. She said it was more elegant and classic than the other style.
After choosing the clothes, the makeover process began. The stylist and the makeup artist were super patient and worked hard to get the desired result. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
After getting dressed and doing makeup, I started to take pictures. The photographer had complete control over my poses and movements throughout the process, which was very relaxed and choreographed.
After the shoot, he chose the four most favorite pictures and showed them to his brother. The outcome was very satisfactory.
I haven't received any replies for 3 days due to your system's inability to recognize my credit card, so I couldn't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The most peculiar thing was that I always used the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay shipping fees every time.
Can I skip the payment first and then submit my salary for deduction later?
Should one buy an insurance raincoat?
The Sunshine umbrella is a platform for insurance and financial services over the Internet.
According to the conditions set forth in the Insurance Regulatory Authority's Guidelines for Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revision): To become an insurance intermediary, you must satisfy three key words: shareholders, founding person has no record of serious law violations in the past three years, minimum capital of RMB 500 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Authority.
This three-tiered system is actually quite complicated, summarizing it all comes down to having strength and endurance, needing to go through the state's regulatory department and the approval of the shareholders. Insurance agents need to have a good attitude and be knowledgeable, and the insurance itself is a legitimate form of investment, so there's no reason to be suspicious of it. Regardless, it is a complicated system, and not every insurance company can achieve it.
In this respect, it's not bad, it's worth trusting.
From the insurance product perspective, Yasunaga Insurance is an insurance marketplace, with many companies' celebrity disease products being sold here, such as the newly released and superstar-endorsed Thai Max 5 Disease Insurance. Claimants and insurers are both Thai people, so there's no reason to doubt its trustworthiness.
From an operating cost perspective, the Internet platform product is more cost-effective than traditional businesses due to the absence of operating costs such as renting office space and hiring employees. Furthermore, the subscription model is flexible and allows for monthly payments, which reduces the burden of paying costs on customers. Finally, it can also be used to maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very impressive.
You can consider it.
From the perspective of insurance professionals, this point is particularly important, as the insurance industry requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health and professional areas. Insurance professionals often add their own subjective views when self-insuring, which can easily lead to misrepresentation and even fraud.
I have done insurance sales over the phone for "Tencent Weibo" (just like Little Umbrella, it is an internet insurance platform). I am very responsible for telling you this.
Insurance for the Internet is real, but it's also risky. Unprofessional Internet channels lack experienced personnel, which can lead to misleading sales.
For example, insurance companies offer policies that cost 600 million yuan and give away free mobile phones. The marketing strategies used are effective, but they are too costly and may not be sustainable. The first month is free, but the second month requires payment according to the normal fee structure. Many customers are confused and do not know why they have to pay for a free mobile phone.
Because they thought they could spend 1 yuan, the insurance company paid out 600 million yuan, but refused to pay the premium fee.
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if you win a prize, you don't have to pay for it and no one will notify you.
For those who are insured, it's just another hole in the ground. 6 million free medical insurance is short-term, if relying on this alone, without any other commercial risks, what if the real illness happens? 6 million can't solve the problem, and life will be full of worries afterwards.
Currently, the government is aggressively combating misleading internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, the platform was fine, the product was fine, and the issue was with the lack of professionalism and supervision of the staff.
Advice clients to consider their options carefully, as there are many more insurance products available online than offline, and the prices can be more competitive.
I have helped 59 online customers by providing support, guaranteeing product quality, and reducing fees by 2000-3000 RMB per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate with me and share your thoughts.
I am an experienced insurance and business management professional with over 3 years of industry training and customer service experience. I have worked with over 100 insurance companies and served thousands of businesses. Before proposing a policy, I will carefully assess customer needs and tailor a product to suit their requirements. During the policy period, I will strive to secure the best possible coverage for the customer. After the policy is in place, I will meticulously process the claim and provide timely and efficient customer service.
Together with each client, we can achieve long-term growth.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, online insurance is the process of insurance customers clicking on the insurance link and completing all the insurance procedures autonomously.
During this process, neither the insured nor the insurance agent needs to sign any documents, and all steps can be completed by the insured himself.
Although Internet insurance may lack the "ceremony feeling" of traditional insurance, it may even replace printed paper contracts, which has no effect on the validity and legal force of electronic contracts.
This kind of pattern is similar to the traditional telephone sales job, but when it comes to buying insurance, it will have a life-threatening problem, that is, - the subsequent service may not match up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contractual agreement that can last up to several decades. When buying insurance, should we carefully consider and reflect upon it? Our chosen "intermediary" should be able to accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even after many years.

From the beginning to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insults, and cannot accept any form of physical attack.
In a civilized society, we can accept everything, but we must eliminate such barbarism.
If you don't look at the party and faction, you must first suppress such inhumane behavior.
From you I started to send friend requests, then I posted a flirty thread on your wall, and finally I tried to publish your home address and father's name on social media, but I didn't get any response.
After you tagged me, you continued to talk about me behind my back in a malicious and insidious manner. You discussed my private matters, such as my shyness, embarrassment, and physical appearance. You even talked about my sleeping and eating habits. All of this made me feel so uncomfortable and humiliated.
After I posted the photo, I received many messages from my friends, some of which contained content related to your face and offensive language.
I'm sorry, as a female student, I can't keep silent anymore.
After you downloaded the news about my reporting, you were not intimidated, instead becoming more and more interested.
Regardless of your political background or identity, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
You can continue this type of argumentative, provocative, humiliating, and berating language, or you can continue to say that you are only concerned and interested in me, or you can continue to deny that it is harassment, or you can even continue to post all sorts of attacking and insulting language.
No, I can't, and I have no power to stop you.
Even if I don't recognize you, I don't want to recognize you. Your appearance and physique are not important enough for me to comment on.
I was so ashamed that I felt like no one would want to be friends with me after what I had done.
My friend asked me, "Is everything okay?"
Even if I speak well, you will not believe me.
I feel that even if no one else is bullied in such a humiliating way, I can still say that I'm doing better than before.
Regardless of work, society, politics, or business, only those people who lack basic human decency will choose to harm any woman in such a manner.
I believe, kindness lies within everyone's heart.
I have cut some of the comments and gave them to everyone for review.
You should not let anyone bully you.
You are the enemy of civilization.
Laugh a little bit.
The Vietnamese government has been actively promoting the development of digital technology, as evidenced by the presence of Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh at the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum.
During the Vietnam National Digital Industry Development Forum, two major events were held to discuss the topics of digital transformation and the economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Mr. Nguyen Mung, expressed that although the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the number of Vietnamese digital technology companies to decrease, their revenue and growth potential remain promising, with an estimated growth rate of around 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has been actively developing digital products and concentrating on solving the major issues facing the country, resulting in an increase in the number of digital products exported and Vietnam's ranking in the digital technology sector.
The vice chairman urged digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing digital platforms for these countries, and to fulfill their national mission.
On the forum, different departments and government agencies are leading, studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology. Companies, organizations, and individuals are sharing their energy and resources to promote the development of the digital technology industry in Vietnam, and to drive the country's digital transformation. Zhu Hui and others have come up with innovative ideas and solutions to tackle the economic recovery.
Xi Jinping emphasized that digital transformation is the world's inevitable path to progress, meeting the concrete demands of development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, digital transformation services should be provided to the whole population, and thus everyone should participate.
People and enterprises are the core, target and driving force of digitalization and transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be made with the people and businesses in mind.
The Premier stressed the importance of digital transformation, which must manifest the national spirit, rely on internal strength, adopt strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external force as important and breakthrough points.
He believed that digital transformation should drive deep and sustainable development, such as in the areas of COVID-19 pandemic control, economic recovery and development, adaptation to post-pandemic changes, and overcoming resource depletion. This would help promote a green transformation and sustainable energy development.
Digital transformation requires participation in the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national flavor, and the establishment of databases related to banking, taxation, land management, and the development of databases and logistics.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and powerful.
The central government requires all levels of government, all levels of organizations and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance power in the development of digital technology, to enhance their understanding of digital transformation, to continue to formulate and perfect the system of digital transformation, to strengthen the management level and to respect, communicate, listen, actively and positively promote the development of digital technology enterprises.
During the forum, Xi Jinping attended the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Excellent Digital Product Award Ceremony and the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.
I have reported, and have attached a picture, but without a reply.

The house was still there even though the railroad had gone by.
Address: No. 555, Beijing Road, High-Speed Rail Station, Changsha, China. See the map.
Here, there are many different brands of home appliances, including many European brands.
At the "Hansden" water filter store, you can find water filters, with prices being quite affordable. There is also an ongoing activity inside the store.
Surprisingly, the house has 11 floors, the underground parking is from level 2 to level 9, and the underground parking fee is free!
The surroundings were unbearable, the food in the restaurant was mediocre and the smell was overwhelming.
This elevator is also very strange, just like that big sickness, going down, going up, continuously pressing the button, from the secure passageway down to the floor, it's very strange, directly going to a furniture store, the furniture store closed, no way out!
Even though the house is still there, it needs to be upgraded as there are many places without development.
The address is Shaowu Bao'akou High-Speed Rail North 555, transportation is convenient, the parking lot is very large, both day and night are free of charge.
Environment: In the store, there are many floors, ranging from 8 to 9. You can buy furniture, home appliances, and various other items, all of which are available. There are many famous brand stores, such as Macy's, H&M, Zara, Gucci, Old Navy, Topshop, and so on. It's overwhelming! There are so many brands that I can only remember them. It's a great place to shop for products, so I can take a break and relax on the sofa.
I was recently thinking of buying a comfortable sofa, and my friends said there are many sofas to choose from here, after looking at Ikea and Mike's, I felt I could still get a good one without spending too much.

The Changjiang River Basin has achieved integrated green services coverage on the water.
On December 11, 2019, the Changjiang River upstream green service area was officially put into operation in Wuhan, marking the second one after the launch of the first one in Sichuan Province on November 8, 2019.
By this point, the Green River Integrated Service Area had covered the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yangtze.
Kong Wen Wu, the Deputy Director of the Changjiang River Navigation Management Bureau, introduced the 10 green service zones along the Yangtze River and the Changjiang River, which have been recognized by the sailors, and played an important role in promoting the quality and safety of the Changjiang navigation.
The event of covering the entire area of the Changjiang Green Transportation and Logistics Service Zone with a green transportation and logistics infrastructure is a significant milestone in the development of the Changjiang River. It has greatly improved the reception of pollutants and the capacity of navigation and logistics services.
As described, the Waterfront Sustainability Hub is an important facility providing comprehensive production and living services to sailors, helping them to address their urgent needs.
This newly constructed green service zone on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrates life services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme. It provides one-stop services such as ship repair and emergency rescue for vessels, making the voyage more efficient and convenient.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China and can be seen in the latest satellite images. The most powerful weapon in the U.S. arsenal is visible and can be accessed from the island of Taiwan. This is a significant signal to the region's allies and adversaries.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, on January 9th, the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) aircraft carrier was found in the Bala Bay area.
The Balaklava Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sunda Strait, is a strategic chokepoint in the Western Pacific.
This platform is expected to be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time an F-35C fighter jet and CMV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft have been deployed aboard the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier for operational deployment.
The United States Navy has two aircraft carriers deployed in the South China Sea. Besides the "Carl Vinson" carrier, there is also the "Harry S. Truman" carrier, which was deployed from the United States on January 3rd.
The F-35C Lightning II, the U.S. Navy's newest carrier-based fighter jet, has made its debut in the South China Sea. The 314th Fighter Squadron of the U.S. Navy's Land-Based Aviation is responsible for the attack.
Besides the two aircraft carriers and the submarine mentioned above, the US Navy has another carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, stationed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The naval vessels included the "Shanghai Lake"-class missile boat, the "Strike Cruiser"-class missile destroyer, and the "Sky Whirlwind"-class anti-ship cruiser.
The United States has deployed three aircraft carriers to the South China Sea, according to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Observation Platform" published on January 17, 2022. The satellite images clearly show the US carriers gathering in the vicinity of China.
(@SouthChinaSea Strategic Situation Awareness) The US Navy has deployed its most powerful weapon to the South China Sea for a rare visit. The CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft flew along the route on 17th January 2022.
According to CNN on January 17th, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's weapons store was mysteriously missing from Guam during the weekend.
The nuclear submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-733) entered the waters of Guam Naval Base on Saturday, January 15th. It was armed with 20 Trident missiles and several dozen nuclear warheads.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have been gathering in the South China Sea, making it the most powerful weapon ever seen in the region. Analysts say this is a signal of the tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US submarine has visited the Diaoyu Islands since 2016, and it is the second time the islands have been openly visited since the 1980s.
The Chinese navy has been expanding its presence in the South China Sea by building military installations on several disputed islands. Recently, Chinese vessels have been seen around the Spratly Islands, which are located near the Philippines.
The island is a popular tourist destination in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy declared in its statement that the Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Yantar" had visited the Paracel Islands, which had strengthened the U.S.-China friendship and cooperation, displayed the U.S. capabilities, flexibility and readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the region.
The usual name for a submarine that carries ballistic missiles is a "Boomer".
The United States Navy's submarine fleet consists of 14 ships, which usually maintain strict secrecy.
The secret of the B-2 Stealth Bomber becoming the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad was revealed. It includes the launching silo for missiles located in the US, as well as the B-2 and B-52 Stratofortresses which can carry nuclear warheads.
Friends discussed the recent plunge in Meta's stock price, which has soared to 2510 billion US dollars, and Zuckerberg responded to "a competition it had never faced before".
Meta（Original Facebook）is a advertising company mainly earning from advertisements. It is the advertising company that makes money today by advertising, with its own traffic channels.
No matter what function you are using, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., they are all Meta's flow channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", enabling many apps to display ads through the platform, thus achieving transformation.
However, times have changed.
First, due to Apple's privacy policy changes, it has become difficult for Metta to obtain user data, which has affected its advertising efficiency.
Apple's privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will display a very clear prompt to users whether they allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google further sharpens its sword, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor of Meta's income growth has weakened (the weight of which is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income each year comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies' contributions to the maritime industry.
There are roughly 800 people working in the Meta office in Hong Kong, with a few dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is the most popular advertising channel. Most of the money burned is from Meta.
One of the major competitors of TT is Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from the Chinese market.
Agents from all over China have been helping each other to promote their businesses on the Chinese social media platform, WeChat. The performance of the Chinese region on WeChat is very good.
Recently, I haven't prepared much, but I'm confident I can almost match my previous performance.
Chinese companies have already passed the phase of large-scale overseas money burning.
Third, the new flow channel was not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is aging, while new platforms such as TikTok and Twitter are gaining in popularity.
The biggest problem is not only income decline, but also lack of growth expectation.
Investors not only consider current income, but also look into the future expectations of how it will turn out.
It was very obvious that expectations for Meta were not met.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Stephen Hawking spoke about "The Universe".
The universe of Meta should be one of the directions of the future, but its implementation cycle is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support its growth in the next three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be more difficult than ever for Meta.
Don't look at the bright side of the current wind, the annual income of 1,000 billion to 2,000 billion US dollars, the current Microsoft crisis is very strong, compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security of the castle river.
Although his various social media platforms are currently popular, they are all mainstream social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but he is no match for TikTok's rapid growth, so he has no confidence and is unable to challenge it. It is just a matter of blind luck.
Translating this Chinese text into English, I found that it is about the concept of space and time. It talks about how short time frames are impossible to succeed in, and how dangerous it is to change companies. It also mentions why Keckeburck chose his path, and why he is always searching for new challenges. I think his path is wrong, as it is a wrong turn.

The two Chinese and Taiwanese armies completed the "Peace and Rescue - 2021" joint exercise and concluded the drill successfully.
On December 12th, 2020, the Xinhua News Agency Huai'an Branch held a joint rescue and relief exercise with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the Thai military. The entire team safely returned to China's Guangxi region after completing the 7-day training mission. This marked the successful completion of the exercise.
This joint performance was to explore the great topic of humanism in medical rescue and relief. We had to be vigilant and tenacious in our work, and to make sure that every casualty was treated with the utmost care and respect. We had to adhere to the standards of real-life battlefield medical treatment and evacuation, and complete the tasks of joint command and joint rescue, joint field medical treatment, and mass casualty evacuation. This effectively improved the two armies' medical rescue and security capabilities.
The result of the cooperation between the Chinese and Vietnamese armies was a great success.
The Vice Chairman of the Exercise Instruction and Supervision Committee, Mr. Long Vuong, spoke at the conclusion of the exercise. Through this exercise, the Vietnamese military medical personnel learned the knowledge and skills of the exercise organization and professional activities from the Chinese side. They also recognized the medical and safety equipment provided by the Chinese side.
The results of the exercise proved the professional capabilities of the Chinese and U.S. military medical forces in the areas of medical assistance and epidemic control.
The Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Wang Sheng, expressed that this exercise was built upon the success of the 2018 Joint Medical Exercise and was another opportunity to explore innovation and practice. It was of great significance.
During the period of practice, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, rapid HIV test kits and other health prevention materials to the Vietnam People's Army.
