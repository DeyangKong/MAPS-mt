The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's retail price.
I am a large customer and thus it is no problem for me.
I need only a number or instruction to attach the package so that it can be tracked as a return to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs her 179€.
I find it very annoying.
Should I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price or is there another way of getting a refund?
I believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their siblings.
Nevertheless, I think it is also good for big siblings to help out with the little ones in moderation.
Look quickly, help quickly, bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
When your K1 is occupied with something for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and spend hours accompanying him in sleep.
It is likely to be legally questionable.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist said.
If something were to happen, such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to handle.
Whether it is a risk that you want to take is of course your own decision ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer...
The story was about fear and how to therapize it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by overdosing on food and going into the enclosure with his pet raptors.
The case is taken over by a commissar who, after a short investigation, goes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissar has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands at this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired to be present at the scene of the suicide and to document it and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center and the patients ultimately face their fears to the extreme.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death.)
This will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there was a great showdown in the clinic which had caught on fire.
That is the rough plot I am sure the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this action is known to someone or if someone even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.

Due to the outbreak of Omikron: Johnson will push for a boosted vaccination.
Politics and Science in Great Britain are constantly dealing with new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all adults in England who are eligible for vaccination should receive the offer by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to progress faster with the Corona vaccine booster shots in light of the rapidly rising Omega numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if three months have passed since their last vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his people.
The target date was originally set for the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish regions can be accelerated.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation due to the Omikron variant, so we need to strengthen our vaccination protection immediately.
The good news is that the vaccine level can be raised again with a third dose.
"Let's get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of Omikron were registered in Great Britain, thus increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I will answer the email.

The feeling of helplessness.
Warning: I will be writing something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I have to write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence due to my profession.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that people don't help themselves or think we can't help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and it will not be perfect.
However, there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I am unable to act in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in conversation with the perpetrator in private, with them far beyond the scope of vision and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will never get lighter this way.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incomprehensible important.

Basketball Bundesliga: Ludwigsburg's Derby Debacle at Crailsheim's Merlins
At least Johannes Patrick was visited by the police.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said that the team still had something of a grudge against their Pokal defeat in October, when they faced Hakro Merlins Crailsheim.
She didn't lay down after the game, but instead increased her performance despite the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the bare result was disappointing.
Let's pretend a statistic is named that expresses the entire dilemma: The trierate rate was 13%, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) at the say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick's response was: "We were not focused enough after our victory in Teneriffa and did not implement what we had trained for."
Moving the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "It was a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in a crowd of 10,000 people.
Only 750 people were allowed to attend the game on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they still managed to make a profit.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided his team to victory.
"The best coach I ever had", praised Gleim still.
While in Patrick's team even the leaders like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole team.
In the last quarter (22:15) they managed to prevent a total disaster and came within eight points of their opponents, after they had already trailed by 39 points.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to procrastinate.
The Giants will already be receiving the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:19 pm), before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.

Always like a bell: Max Raabe will be 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is traveling with the program "Good Morning, Lovely Luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig.
Nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "due to governmental instructions" in order to contain the Corona virus.
Even other performances of his in the Advent season have to be cancelled, as it is stated on the website of the singer, who is 59 years old, and his band (www.palast-orchester.de).
Artists will then try to catch up on their 2020 postponed performances in January.

Federal Minister for Housing Klara Geywitz: Through Enteignment no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister for Housing Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as it has been demanded in the Berlin referendum.
"With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly.
The coalition in Berlin will set up an expert committee to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
When the situation did not calm down, Geywitz was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent ceiling until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rental market.
I will be speaking with the Justice Minister to get it done as soon as possible.
Even if the housing market does not relax, we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps, emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 people were killed by tornados in Kentucky.
Several tornadoes have been spawned by a devastating storm system in the USA.
It is feared that more than 100 people could have died in Kentucky alone.
The images from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several Tornados have caused severe destruction and may have claimed up to hundred lives in the USA.
The storms have left a roughly 320-kilometer-long path of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, "Everywhere the tornado went, it was completely leveled."
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is impossible to imagine that it is possible.
He is counting alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers are rising hourly.

Companies are paying vaccine premiums and changing their advertising slogans.
While the German government is rejecting proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money rewards for getting vaccinated.
By doing so, they are on the same page as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
Even the transformation of advertising slogans into "Impfaufrufe" - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Help with first own campaign.
Wow!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure Over the Greifenpass and would like to seamlessly transition them into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
The further action should take place there.
The hero should be lured into a trap by a group of goblins that are some miles away from the village.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group Strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords equipped.
Goblins lurk in ambush along the path, armed with three-arrowed bows from the left and right. Two others stand ready to stop the wagon with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes surrender, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes were all rendered unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
If a defeat was unavoidable, this half-elf would join the fight with two of his men and help the heroes in their battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is the Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much for a first adventure?
The Goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I hadn't expected so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee to implement many of your ideas and now also have more trust in my narratives.

I am frustrated with Sky Sports F1.
Hello lovely F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been steadily decreasing over the season, so I thought I'd take a break with this post.
First, the F2 race was interrupted in the middle to start the F1 coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and crash had put the plan far behind, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It appears that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and must therefore restrict itself, so that Sky DE had no choice.
Despite being dumb, Sky UK has ended the race.
Despite a small compliment: Olivier Zwartyes did a great job accompanying the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was again a rule misunderstanding by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they didn't know that one has to change the tires under a red flag.
Although there had been this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both decided that Verstappen could change his tyres only when there were appropriate radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I believe one should be familiar with such basic rules if one is commentating on a Pay-TV F1 channel.
It is not the first riddle game that is now allowed or prescribed by the rules, both having constant uncertaint # Kanton Saint-Germain-en-LayeKanton Saint-Germain-en-Laye is een kanton in het Franse departement Yvelines.Kanton Saint-Germain-en-LayeHet kanton omvat de volgende gemeenten:* Andrésy* Bailly* Chambourcy* Chatou* Clamart* Conflans-Sainte-Honorine* Jouy-en-Josas* Louveciennes* Marly-le-Roi* Maule* Meulan-en-Yvelines* Montigny-le-Bretonneux* Le Pecq* Saint-Germain-en-Laye (hoofdplaats)* Sailly-sur-Charente* Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche* Vaucresson
In general, she doesn't like the artificial style of commenting of Roos, but it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness, which both look unprofessional, as ordering coffee with the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Harding or "UuuuuHD" of Ralf Schumacher.
The last one is causing total chaos in the comments, which he clearly doesn't take seriously.
Not least, advertising has taken over completely at Sky, in the last round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, so one has to listen to the German audio without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor the ORF are doing it.
These two channels do not do as much advertising as Sky, and they are free-TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, it does not make up for the drawbacks.
The rest of the programming from Sky Sports F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of the F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast unironically.
Unfortunately, the great Formula 1 season is not as enjoyable as it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Air pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate an air filtration system using an air pump.
This series will be offered in 3 variants by us.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can compare the performances there.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate an entire facility?
If you have a large aquarium, two- or multi-outlet pumps are suitable for connecting multiple emitters.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, an air pump can be used to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decoration, which transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to call.
The MK-Series has a special, soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noises.
The installation is very easy.
The fan motor is connected to a 4/6 mm air hose...and it can already start.
The fan should be level, or higher than the water level, and should be installed outside.
If the water level is lower than the pump, a check valve should be installed between the pump and the tank.
Cut the air hose and insert the ventil between.
This would prevent it from happening if the water were to run backwards through the pump from the basin...

The pumps of the MK-Series are pure power packages, consuming little energy.
Even though we have to specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, the orders are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to take precautions so that no one is feeling irritated due to the delay.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for the employees who also work in the logistics...of course, here the Corona virus has nothing to do with it.
Please don't rate us poorly just because the delivery was delayed, it's the fault of the delivery services.
People swear naturally when talking about these services, even though we are saying...they have it hard.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is sending his daughter and a space exploration moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV-moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, wearing a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space flight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much each of them paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not reveal.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his missions.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusias Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Civic CentreNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Civic CentreA new public artwork has been unveiled at the Civic Centre in Ballymena.The artwork, which is located outside the main entrance to the building, was created by local artist David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture of a tree, made from steel and aluminium, which is illuminated at night. It is intended to represent the natural beauty of the surrounding area and to provide a focal point for the town.The artwork was funded by Ballymena Borough Council and the Department for Communities.Councillor Paul Reid, Chair of Ballymena Borough Council’s Development Committee, said: “This is a wonderful addition to the Civic Centre and I am delighted that we have been able to bring this project to fruition. The artwork is a beautiful representation of the natural beauty of the area and I am sure it will be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.”
The astronaut would love to go back to space again, said the moderator.
New Shepard is capable of flying up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness, before it was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no universally accepted definition.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, Blue Origin's Vice President of Strategy and Business Development Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the world of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

This is a DDR Handwork Model E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was in use in East Germany and Central Germany. It is very rare, and likely comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railroader magazine, issue 11/1968. It has been used and has some play and missing parts, but it is in good condition. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the schlesische network. It is possible that the kit also comes from the small-scale manufacturer Zschütschke and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being restored for operation.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2.200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was required to be 65 km/h.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to procure the locomotive as a 1’Co+Co1’ type with Tatzlager drive from AEG for the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and eventually settled on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the readiness of all six locomotives was established.
As the re-electrification of the Mitteldeutsche network progressed, a growing need for locomotives for the heavy freight train service arose. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the available E 04, E 44, and E 94 were preferred for construction in larger quantities.
When it became clear that the number of repairs on the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They arrived at the railway workshop in Halle P. in 1960.
They were usually stationed in a separate timetable before coal trains from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
It proved to be increasingly difficult to control the locomotives as they aged.
It often happened that Schütze got stuck while performing health checks.
Then the Beimann, who had to travel constantly on this locomotive, had to unlock the shutter with a hammer and a wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and caused months-long failures of the locomotive.

In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to only have one-man crews for their electric locomotives, which would have caused problems for the driver's visibility and control of the train in poor visibility.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on October 5th, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives, including E 95 02, were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating device on the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it in a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
She had belonged since then to the Transportation Museum in Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) is taking care of the locomotive in a museum-like way.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint job, with the transformers being checked and five traction motors being found to be operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their reliable engine and minimal maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to join the Mitteldeutsche Netze.
The main theater of operations was initially Schlesien.

To Strengthen Trust - Biontech CEO Publishes Vaccination Photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur published a photo of himself getting his Corona vaccination.
His friend's illness moved him to share.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a picture showing him getting a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the network "LinkedIn".
"My friends have been urging me to post a picture of myself getting vaccinated to counteract the false rumors."
So far he has refused it, as the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust.
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Uğur Şahin has been circulating on the internet, in which he says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the German Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," said Şahin then.
In Germany, there is a prioritization when it comes to vaccinations.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been long since abandoned - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in Transformer Station: Ten Thousand People Without Power
In several towns in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases, also no heating.
A fire had disabled an electricity substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electrical substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to without power for 24 hours.
Thousands of people had their lights go out on Friday evening due to a disaster in several communities.
Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power sources had been in operation until the widespread power outage was finally resolved late Saturday evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered places of refuge in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and thanked the helpers for their effort.
We are aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the county, the fire departments and the THW for their untiring effort", said the head of the Primary Technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take some more days, since the Westnetz-Monteure had to first put up some provisional connections of the leitings.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company's statements.
Electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 PM local time in the Westnetz Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
There are expensive cleaning and repair works necessary there.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt level of electricity was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday at 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power back.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were switched gradually from 21:30.
Since 11:15 PM, even the last ones affected by the power outage had no electricity.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and its partner companies were involved.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important now that citizens look after each other in their neighborhoods, especially for older or single people, and inform the local fire stations if help is needed, as explained by Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the elderly people living in nursing homes were particularly focused on.
In addition, according to government reports, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical supervision.

In order to ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should wash the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry thoroughly.
Before you use the brush with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the later not visible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
A light overlap of the color layers ensures a even surface later.
Avoid quick, back and forth wiping with the brush.
This leads to unrealistic square footage.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors are finished off with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal flakes when they are mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you sand them.
The models can achieve an original look through the decals or stickers.
From airplane insignia to ship names to model decorations and identification marks on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order, as long as the parts are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be/easily fitted before it is inserted into the body.
More important than the right tool such as a knife, scissors and tweezers are when gluing patience, time and a steady hand.
Cut out each individual decal and place it correctly.
Decals are also known as water-sliding pictures, because you can make their back side wet by quickly pouring water on it until the paper backing becomes dark.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also dampened before).
While you are holding the decal in place with a tool, you are gently pulling the transfer paper away from the model.
Attention: Always check to make sure the picture is securely in place before you completely remove it from the paper, to prevent it from sticking to a finger, knitting, or tearing.
Absorb excess water with a housekeeping towel.
This product is not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only open a book for a few seconds as soon as I look away, then I have to log out and log in again and find the place I was reading from.
I have already communicated with you once before on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Is it possible to get a discount for all 3 packages?
For the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me.
Despite everything, thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back problem-free?

We were in the fertility treatment for a while, now that it's about the bill with the PKV, it suddenly stands this.
In order:
We had applied for the IVF cycle in advance and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, which was then reimbursed by the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the PKV yet.
We applied again for cost coverage from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second child wish be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, the insurance case begins with the treatment, and ends when the treatment no longer is necessary.
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right to claim the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the contract that a birth would have caused the further attempts to fail?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (resulting from blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thanks a lot for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants via email and tell me how I can get them again best?
Everything is in order.
We will not place any more orders with them.
When they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass it on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me to send it back.
I can't do anything about it if the chest of drawers shows up completely destroyed at my place.
Can you please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot?
It is clear and evident that the repayment was triggered and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two loyal customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do it anymore.
No, the defect appeared only after several months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal usage.
They are not allowed to sell it as a office chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty lasts 24 months.
No, I am not able to get another type of packaging.
I will take the chest of drawers apart and be able to give it to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# series.
These products are being advertised with additional purchase incentives, which we unfortunately cannot find at your location.
Can they help?
The topic of the week: The best low budget films
A low-budget film is not easily defined, as there are no exact budget limits that apply to all films.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find a plethora of lists of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What bothers you about it?
What do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already two apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was now extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat, where one has to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will then give up soon, as it is simply not working here.
Hello
A half-hearted victory against Belarus has come at a high cost for the EU.
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs would be very high and would involve massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the conflict in a sustainable manner, according to a researcher at the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This shaky state - Belarus is not giving up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - it will probably still go on for a while.
The way people are treated at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong.
It appears that there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by certain EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not take a firm stance against it, it will come at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens simultaneously the unity in the Union.
She apparently cannot prevail if a member state decides to go its own way, as is the case with Poland, which even refuses the EU border security agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition to paying for its policy at the border with Belarus, the EU has had to pay another price, according to Bossong: It has become more difficult to reach an agreement on the asylum policy, as the line "border security, border security, border security" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again.
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to illegally enter Poland from Belarus.
55 migrants were apprehended in the night and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday.
Polish officers were attacked near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants with stones.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
The Border Control registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already managed to overcome the border controls by Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU is accusing Alexander Lukaschenko of being a dictator in Minsk for luring them with the promise of visa-free travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithu # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football. Bayern Munich participated in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.FC Bayern MunichThe season began with the club winning the 2018 DFL-Supercup, defeating arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1. Bayern Munich went on to win the Bundesliga title for the sixth consecutive season, finishing 11 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Werder Bremen. In the Champions League, Bayern Munich reached the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by eventual champions Liverpool. In the UEFA Super Cup, Bayern Munich defeated Sevilla 2–1 to win their third consecutive title.## Players### First-team squadAs of
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened to suspend the flight operations of airlines that transport migrants and refugees to the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its power in the market into the scales and has demonstrated its resolve by using hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared to accept that the security apparatus regularly herds thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has protested the controversial Formula 1 finish.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspected of two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is being made against Max Verstappen's alleged breach of the rules at Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes's viewpoint, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-compliant manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was performed shortly after the conclusion of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had passed the car ahead of him.
I am testing it.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the support.

Sorry but only because he says he is not an antisemite means nothing.
That is like when an AfD supporter says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither will they admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of antisemitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, then one should just leave it completely.
You're just as unserious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question the fundamentals of evolution are simply lost.
In any case, a god had set it in motion.
However, once you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
Therefore, you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal vision field, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the Lupe practically error- and color-free even in the edge area.
Loupes with magnification ratings are often marked.
These conditions apply only to exact specified conditions that rarely match the user's conditions.
In order to use your Lupe optimally, please take into account the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (See the instructions in the package).
On the surfaces of all optical devices - even in impact loupes - light reflections are created.
By using an anti-reflection coating, these reflections can be significantly reduced.
When used according to the optimal usage conditions - loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Yes, but it used to be called something else.
You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the village of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even had to go home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
He plants there about 2000 pieces every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many funny situations.
The Christmas season always manages to make things a bit more cheerful, he says.
And with the discount?
Why am I as a customer gone?!
Although I received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat, which is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from tasty.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having trouble setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly, receiving and sending 50 Mbit without any issues.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also come.
However, at the other end of the DLan module, which is sending out the WiFi, not more than 500 come out, but the further I get with the module, the lesser (so I use a power outlet which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was better than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Could someone explain why so much Internet speed is lost over the power line with glass fiber?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to install LAN cables in that house.
I am really at the point of despair, so I created this extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted by a response.
When it's time to switch the Girokonto.
No one thought there would be peace at the Giro accounts now, but they have been deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases, negative interest rates have further eroded customers' deposit protection.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 Euros.
She has just halved her monthly allowance and even quartered her daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to €50,000 for Giro and investment accounts, and €25,000 for current accounts.
However, these lower freeboard levels now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson upon request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 Euros before, which is still valid, as well as for the ING Germany.
The popular cost-conscious customer bank DKB has reduced its free withdrawal limits in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
Despite this: More than 100 banks have according to the Internet portal Verivox already a free bonus of 25,000 Euro or less.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 Euros: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there between the consumer centers, which initially won the case in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin.
Now banks are discussing whether they should set up reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and have to repay many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty team working for her.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Your life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, who in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" caused a stir, this success is mainly due to discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers are dedicated to perfecting your appearance.
Even though, as Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, really: one single chip out of the bag).
That you are able to attract the hearts of both female and male fans equally is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she has bad luck with the good - and still looking for the great love.
He has removed the baby wish from the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked had no idea what was wrong with me medically, why I couldn't.
It was really insulting.
Keep hoping that success and fame will make you happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen has to retire.
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light tire rub, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also gone to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I have calculated it, I need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026." said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he initially fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, by moving up from third place.
Then he changed something in the material settings and on Sunday he drove with 0.30 seconds a larger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came third.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also notched his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner, who was driving to Stuttgart, came in second this time, but placed fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in fourth place in the first race, resulting in an eighth-place finish.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would also do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte with Home Success - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third home bob season on her track.
After coming fourth the day before in the Monobob, she raced to a World Cup victory with her Anschieberin Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Mariama Jamanka, the two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion from the BRC Thüringen, came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked her Olympic qualification as well as her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is going with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot of work to be done elsewhere".
Jamanka was a bit frustrated by the not entirely error-free runs, but she said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't cash it in, so I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had run out which made me very frustrated.
They were talking about the sofa in the chat.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is currently reduced.
Why is the shipping not started until 16.3?
Nothing was mentioned on your website about long delivery times.
No, not until I press the tip comes a extra field with the message.
Your colleague took your blood pressure yesterday.
Why is it today a problem?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
However, we would still like to buy the dresser module, even a new unscathed one.
Don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have a few things I want to write down and maybe it will help the one - or the other...
I am 24, have a part-time job, am a student and a dogmama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to the kindergarten, he is pretty much 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, has got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him and we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the bathing (because his hand was in a bandage due to burns).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is feeling sick, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I warmed the heating pad and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now there's even more homework for us to do, which we'll have to divide up among us.
However, cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) illness is currently doing very well, I am halfway through my therapy and am managing okay.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is requiring a lot (for me), tomorrow I have a written test for which I have not prepared anything, and I should at least prepare something for the anatomy lecture that I have tomorrow.
Next week I have a written exam on Tuesday, and then whatever comes up is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room for it.
My week is going like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then what happens?
Only until the birthday.
There are only a few days left until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors to prevent me from going crazy.
I feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't seem to do anything else...
Does it also go for you?
I am endlessly grateful that I do not have to work.
I am truly endlessy thankful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think it has something to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I could find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you at least a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately it is the wrong color and texture, with a scratch on the table top and chest of drawers.
The first delivery was exactly the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
When we are going to change the table, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on #DATE#.
In addition, two times.
She was not confirmed.
Nothing was the same: I noticed in school then that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe because I was brought up Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you stand it?
You may also be able to tell stories about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
I generally understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the Theory of Relativity.
What brings someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I would like to write in English as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would abandon it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response within the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search Help please
Hello lovely people,
I am searching for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a film for young adults.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (similar to those in the movie The Curse of the Black Pearl).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who is trying to bring the woman there so he can live.
I believe the crossing is also the soldier's grave.
I believe they are fighting each other at the end.
If this message means something to you, I am grateful for every response.
Our Little One has only slept on her back since Week 1.
Forward: lives still :D
Relax.
One child holds more than what is thought.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, more often go in and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Although we had no sleeping bag, we always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it get something up from the stomach?
Does it lie with its face first in the mattress?
You can draw conclusions from this whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was a big change and a joy to be able to put the kids on their bellies to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "Stammkunde" (loyal customer) at your store and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any response.
It's about my wardrobe which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the chest.
I would very much appreciate it if you could contact me as soon as possible.
The chest is not currently usable.
To make it completely clear.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had fun with RBTV as well.
It's simply become the case that the politics of this station have gone completely haywire.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: He wanted to be "no running advertisement column".
What am I now?
A 0815 advertising sender, who tries to sell his BillMerch to the elite fan.

Kirsch kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as they can absorb and release heat very well.
The detachable inner cushion can be easily warmed in a microwave or oven.
The soft connection makes the application especially pleasant, so that they feel secure, even if it does not always go well.
This cherry kernel pillow with attachment is suitable only for the following applications:

After heating, shake the blanket to evenly distribute the heat!
Afterwards, the inner cushion should be returned to its place.
At the first warming, a slight humidity can form on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Follow the given heating instructions exactly, as longer periods or higher energy levels can cause damage (fire and burning risk!).
Check to make sure that heating the kiss in the microwave is allowed according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
After the heated inner cushion was put back into place, please check the temperature of the cushion for babies (maximum 43 °C) on your armrest!

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped being charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought, a power supply alone would be enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with an inserted power adapter.
Afterwards, I took the battery out, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
We don't know how high the seat is.....
Even when travelling and still carrying lots of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
This camera bag can hold up to 20 liters of equipment, even larger photo equipment without any problems, thanks to the padded FlexFold-Tear.
And what else you may need for everyday objects, remains well organized and separable from the photography equipment.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The minimalistic design of the Peak Design Everyday Backpack series is a classic example of this - it has innovatively protected the interior of the backpack while still allowing for quick access to photography gear.
It works with two possibilities: Either conventionally through the lid latch, which can be secured with the MagLatch-closure system, or with an excellent thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself at the Messenger Bags.
Inside the closure is a metal latch with matching brackets on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “fill levels”: there are four stabilizing cross-members, laser-etched, to which the latch can be securely attached.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, you take a lower one.
Doors and handles are also magnetically attracted.
The backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook.
The second option differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other photography backpacks in a fundamental way: Besides the flap closure, there is also a side-release buckle on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with a top-opening access - you don't have to rummage through the contents anymore!
This clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you are carrying not only your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage as well.
In your everyday backpack you can customize the interior (more details below) and thus store both items separately while still having access to them independently - and through the two side openings, too.
You can also draw the backpack from the right side, so that you can reach the camera equipment in the right main pocket, while the daily essentials remain securely in the left backpack pocket and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, adjustable shoulder straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, even the contents will remain dry, even if it is going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I had ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will immediately place a larger order, but I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected was not something I could anticipate and I was unable to address and clarify it in a timely manner.
However, I as a customer do not accept this damage.
Roti...
Rotring brake discs are manufactured from castings and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All the made glasses are produced in short series according to individual technical features, which are specific for each glass and pattern.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which follows the contours of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The resulting sound-dampened glasses ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the glass, while the notches improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake shoes.
The aesthetic features of our polished glass emphasize its character by attractive and noticeable appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered shining pieces of gold in the water at the southern branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing towns in the state.
Areas were surveyed, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is seeking wealth and fame in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the nearby rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must exceed your pioneer colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategic game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources prudently and build a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions, and apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge pieces, you can fine-tune your individual playing style.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year when California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most Pioneers, it receives a ban!
This deactivates the one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players will take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolvermen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The Anpreiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on forever until the Announcer has moved five times, thus completely covering all the locations and the year ends.
There is a shootout, in which the players Coloma must defend against an attack of enraged bandits.
When the players have contributed enough Revolvermen and are numerically superior, they are rewarded.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up on the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Holetschek: States are discussing the loss of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated.
The Health Ministers of the Länder want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide abolishment of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people.
"We need clarity quickly, whether and when the three-times vaccinated can be exempt from the test duty", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus for immunization", said Holetschek.
The German Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to deliver a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the next day, Tuesday.
I will also return the lamp.

Can you help me further?

What could be the cause of this?
What you are describing will be referred to as *Awareness*, which includes sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is the most common sensation, followed by seeing images and feeling pain the least.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of Awareness, since one has to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however it had** u/Nitemarex **by definition no.

Tips and Tricks for Rouladen

Where there is still Christmas ham in Lübeck.
For many people, Goose or Duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas Tree and presents.

Now time is short.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube preamp contributes significantly to the heat and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controls you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
The amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, allowing you to reduce the sound level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion.
It already sounded like it was possible to activate a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, if it ever got too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, you can access the full potential of the VT+ series in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line input.
This signal is processed with a boxing simulation so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
The AUX-Buchse can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate sound device.
If you purchase the VFS5 foot pedal, you can access the sounds by tapping your foot, adjust the effects blocks on/off and control the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essentially required for live deployment.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But they had seen it differently.
Is there any possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it too low for a dining table?
I would also like to return it.

Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Talks
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the talks regarding the revival of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
Both sides are standing on the brink of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", since at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks were resumed after a week-long break to revive the agreement.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
Even a US delegation is present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now the German federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, its value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only German state to have a higher than 1000 Corona cases on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new cases of infection per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which always had the highest incidence in Germany, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, within a day, there were 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus infection and 16 additional deaths related to the virus.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday with intensive medical care.
On weekends, there can be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand it.
Since the delivery is expected to begin in early March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the package and give it to the post, right?
Do I have to click/select/fill anything else here?
I want to avoid that, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return to sender.

It is time for changes.
The German Bundestag has greeted me, I am here in Strasbourg in the Plenary Hall of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post here for?
When one looks back at the activities of the past months in the Bundestag, one can conclude that it is not extinct.
We have gotten into a wintertime standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem located?
What happened?
Most likely, it is simply a matter of customer dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong and we generally stand in a bad position.
In the last days, there has been an increasing feeling that many people here are really looking forward to the federal election.
What we have to change.
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking which one wants to keep it alive.
The spark came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of this project and found a, simply put, garbage heap.
After several rounds of editing, a few people from the community have found each other and are eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call upon everyone once more to participate, so that this project can have a future existence.
We have created a Discord server for discussing this and to be able to work on concrete things together.
You can join the server by following this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten a few things, but it's not too bad, we have Discord at the end.
When you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together, and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade that will be delivered to you.

Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the sky is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daybed #PRS_ORG#, do you have it in extra large, for example 240/240?

I have not found a suitable packaging, but I will try to take the shelf apart as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by telephone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for the assembly?
How long would I have time to obtain these or decide to return them?
Why are you vegan?
I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She has tried vegetarianism before, but now eats meat only occasionally.
I was a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I had thought that by being a vegetarian I would be supporting the animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that they were feeling unhappy, she defended then vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and how vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm asking myself if my answer was too "plump".
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without wanting to.
A vegan-loving harmony-seeking person greets you.
It is not an exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.

Thanks first and foremost for taking the time to get involved in this, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar capacity, meaning we were both bodyguards in the executive, furthermore I do not wish to go into detail!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistically.
Generally, one should say that the state employee is more likely to come from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, people on the right of the political spectrum are attracted to uniforms and weapons carriers, as well as anyone who is clear that these people can not cope with the realities of life. This is also clear, because you have now in addition to the average white, many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I mean not the overly feminine stereotypical gay, but rather normal men and women who do not make it obvious when they tell them). And I can rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or set this for you.
Even though they may seem comical at first, my experience shows that they have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel alienated by overly-liberal policies, which they perceive as trying to help them but instead only making them feel singled out and not treated normally.
Back to the Right, since of course police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, which however openly express their opinion there or even openly plan state-threatening plans, which is overly exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have recently been on an international mission to start generalizing and making statements that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right-wing extremists will meet and have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it will be successfully combatted and counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered from the German side.

When I placed my order, it was not sold out.
I placed my order in November.
You confirmed my order in your confirmation.
It's still about my order that's not deliverable anymore.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# shopping basket for #NUMBER# euros to Germany or it is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner firm.
However, there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part, which are filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Can a child order?
Hello, I have been occupied by a thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with little free time), but I have never been able to keep my household clean and organized for long.
There are always phases in which nothing gets done, and then suddenly I am overwhelmed and I clean and organize.
However, it is actually never so that someone spontaneously comes to visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly loses housekeeping against work and lack of enthusiasm.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you been able to become a more orderly parent?

For me, there is no motivation to keep the place clean, it just doesn't bother me, as long as there is no visitors and the place is always neat and tidy.
Do you need a bigger push or stay sloppy?
I am looking forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically shaped cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for a near-unrestricted movement.
Pre-shaping with specialized further shaping at the joints for improved movement freedom (at arm and knee bends).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 more than doubled the covered area to further enhance comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality forms in the lower back area and step ensure a tight, perfect fit.
The 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility by the waist adjustment and improves comfort, especially when bending and when attaching and removing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and the back guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Placed on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
A thin (2 mm) seamless face padding at the helmet increases comfort, as well as the sealing and durability (separate helmet).
A soft, flexible zone at the neckline improves the waterproofing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a gentle, kind-to-fabric hook-and-loop closure, which does not interfere with the lining or stitching.
Double-layered sleeves with a zippered closure at the arm and foot joints connect a detachable inner sleeve with a soft, cushioned neoprene outer sleeve.
45° Inward Pleat at the End of the Inner Pocket for Increased Elasticity and Durability when Putting On.

Neoprene panels were bonded with external and internal overlapping.
Edges of the outer sleeves lined for greater durability.
The edges of the inner pockets have been cut for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
Career in Social Work - As Someone with a Self-Doubting Personality Disorder?
I have completed an education in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am more and more aware that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work.
The Problem: I have an anxious (or avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
It roughly means that I lack self-confidence and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a rational level, but it is difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come across as unapproachable.
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather not work as a street worker or in an open youth club but rather in examples such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS has already caused problems in my job (emotionally), as it always brings me down when it finds something to criticize in my code ("just another simple thing messed up") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how it goes"/"I must seem pretty incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every job but I wanted to mention it here.
Did they return the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation.
I was waiting for an appointment for pickup.
Please give me back what they mean!
When I have downloaded a book onto my #PRS_ORG#, a message will appear saying that I am not authorized to download this book.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my chest of drawers.
The protein (Eiweiß) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its stomach and intestines into the individual amino acid building blocks (Aminosäuren). From these blocks the bird then builds its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather growth.
The feather development of the nestling and the feather regrowth of the molting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the organism as a whole.
Please note that Nekton-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the reproductive cycle.
After this standard gift from NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin supplement with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral substance preparation).

1 gram Nekton-Bio per 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft feed.
It is advisable to only prepare as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
A stricken measuring spoon (incorporated) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
At strong feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather-building process is completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be kept dry and away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is being sold as a office chair.

Statement of a Church Member in Conflict with the Constitution
Hello everyone,German: Ich möchte bitte ein paar Fragen zu deutschen Rechtsprechung haben.English: I would like to ask a few questions about German case law.
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree should be felled on our property.
A petition to the municipality has been submitted.
A worker wrote to me that pruning of fruit trees and thus also of walnuts is not part of the regulation.
In the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the regulation is clear.
I am grateful for your answers.
We understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Okay, then I always have a snack without using it.
Could you offer me a discount or a gift card?
What were expensive?
I believe it, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euro and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you test it?
Emergency Notification: Serious Traffic Accident at Selb
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police press alert (14:03), a car has been overtaken in the wrong lane and crashed.
There are injured people.
I understand.
Great, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career life.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is not great, because my beloved head is currently destroying everything it can.
Before I start here now.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the recon as a quarterback.
I originally studied something else and worked in that area (so as to at least be a little anonymous, I won't specify any more details).
It was all too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun.
Eventually I landed a job as a teacher and was sure it was the one - even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I'm googling other job postings" place.
And it has been only half a year.
Before each painting I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can always turn back.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Although there are vacations, there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then it was my weekend and my celebration evening.
I had freedom.
And the stress on the job was equal in the moments.
I'm feeling too much stress from the family celebration.
And then there are these rigid structures, which only add to my nerves.
In general, it is fun and from the outside it looks like the Ref is going well, which is related to feedback.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't do so already.
I'm asking myself if I want to keep on like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions -, or if I should rather go back to the old area, where I felt appreciated, had free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but adequately paid and in a team.
But then I ask myself whether I wouldn't be back at the same place a year later and unhappy.
You may notice that it is all a bit confusing, but perhaps you outsiders can provide some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, in which I am completely finished and almost start crying at the smallest thought.
I will not make any decisions now because it is likely to lead to something bad.
But maybe your views can help me to at least get a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which would already be enough for me.
Thank you for reading and apologizing for my whiny tone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since their introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, resulting in a combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new Modeling Engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amplifiers contain, of course, the renowned Valvetronix tube preamp stage.
This relies in part on real analog circuits, as they capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this intricate circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances can only be heard.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even change and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you always imagined them to be.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
Since then, it has been refined several times in order to meet the new sound requirements, which resulted in a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was designed so that all guitarists on the search for a maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage particularly determined the tube character of the amplifier and developed accordingly the VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
The 12AX7 tube-loaded Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA is still going on.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure panels, it can be adapted to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-frame reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can still store a lot of accessories.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photography-unfriendly items.
Pilots of drones have found a perfect choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, since it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including its remote control and accessories.
Volcanic Eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has become the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island before the West Coast of Africa.
No reliable data exists about past eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has recently decreased, but volcanologists are still hesitant to make any predictions as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state television station RTVE.
Damages in Million-Dollar Range
In the three months since the eruption began, the hot lava has destroyed more than 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
About 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses, each about 50 hectares in size, have been created by the freezing of lava along the coast.
The banana industry, which is vital for the island, was particularly hard hit, with about half of the 85,000 inhabitants depending on it either directly or indirectly. It had already been in a state of crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas suffering significant damage, reported the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is standing at the door and the children can hardly wait for it.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have bound together with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something alluring.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that can still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "social contract of natural peoples" can be renewed and infused with life.
How Nicholas became the Christkind.
In strict terms, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days so closely with the gift-giving.
On the occasion of St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged in various ways.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women a bag of gold in one night, so that they could avoid a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular German custom of filling shoes with gifts for children arose.
Protestants were offended by this practice, as they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they are protesting against the institution.
Martin Luther transformed the Nikolaus into the Christkind and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details so closely, it only angers a few more that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas celebrations with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the Advent season.
Today, one can find shoes by the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to highly desirable luxury watches, fulfilling everyone's desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the giving of gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian countries, there is a joyful commotion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, is visited. Over time, he has acquired some distinct characteristics.
This includes, for example, his white drunken beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his slew, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas time.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia sometimes bring mythical creatures the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that are pulling the slew as a troika.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

The police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a man was shot by the police on Saturday who was armed.
The police announced that the caller had reported a man with a weapon who had gone into a bank and a gambling establishment.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by the police.
It sounded like shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.

The Pill Problem
Hello lovely women,
I hope I did everything right, it is my first post on Reddit after a year.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I was suffering from unbearable period pains and terrible PMS before my period.
I would rather stay, since I already take enough medication that I have to take.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosively pimpled during my last two-year break from 0 to 100.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
In the two-year pause, it never really normalized.
Someone might have some tips to avoid this situation in the future.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and quiet, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Thank you to each and every one who has read the novel!
The love of skin is so nice.
He had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large knotty patches and the acne problem.
I have tried various diets during my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar-free, milk-free, and meat-free mishmash diet because nothing else worked so well.
It could also be that it's simply the worm in there, but if I'm like this everywhere I'd rather not search any longer what else is wrong.
I had already given her all the information she needed.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What would I have to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe something is wrong.

Referencing Lesson Planning (EK)
Hello lovely colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer, but I currently have great problems to plan my lessons in the subject Earth Science in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can only use the chalkboard, textbook and an OHP as media.
In school I can only copy (what I need for) geography for free.
I need to plan my hours for now very long.
We are currently discussing the topic of GeoFactors and every hour is standing for itself.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need it for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books, which my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am not very satisfied with most of the problems in the book.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a teacher of Earth science can help me become more time-efficient when working with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G-Regulation around Christmas.
Most businesses now require that one must either be vaccinated or have recovered from the virus in order to be allowed in.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments losses of income.
He also had a possible solution ready.
According to the German Trade Association (HDE), 2G regulations will damage the Christmas business of the retail sector.
Complaints have been made about a decrease in sales of non-daily items at shops, according to HDE-Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off their Christmas shopping.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year, is now often a hole with no bottom", said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions lost in the past week approximately one third of their pre-crisis sales.
It is only running well in the retail sector and the online sector.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Wearing a mask, maintaining a distance and following proper hygiene practices is a safe matter, said the main business executive.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he said.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the Bundestag must approve the nationwide introduction of the Bands Regulation.
After that, each customer must be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access with the received bandage to all shops on that day.
In addition, in the retail sector - as already in the public transportation for the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should be random checks.
Even the specialist in shopping centers Immobilienkonzern Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-COVID-19 level, with the sales at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping season, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts will be made to find solutions and to obtain approval for them.
This includes the so-called "Bandchen" solution, where "visitors, for example, have to present their 2G identification at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel, can enter the shops without any further security checks". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a mistake, which was tried to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and taped it up.
How do I need to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is handled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
One of the special features of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance is excellent.
In addition, it can also be used in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working on a film set or in a studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is installed in hard to access places.
On the back of the light there is a control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
The user's storage has three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply done by pressing the longer of the storage buttons and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 Functionality, as it allows for operation with cost-effective NP-F AAA batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display windows (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the headlights with power through the provided network cable.
The construction of the searchlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm threaded hole for attachment, so you can directly connect your camera.
The inclination can be reliably set using the leveling screws at both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components were of the highest quality and therefore designed for longevity and hard use.
Additionally, a steering damper is included in the delivery.
The included bag is great.
You can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
I was so disappointed when I gave her the gift and it was too small.
We were going to throw a party after Frankfurt's comeback win against Leverkusen.

After 22 minutes, it seemed as if the last two series of losses had doomed the Hessens to yet another Bundesliga failure.
However, then the SGE turned around, scored itself within a good hour of frustration over a mediocre season start and won furiously with 5:2. "It's insane, what the guys did today", shouted coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "general praise, to all of them, who were involved", out.
Initially, it looked like it would be another dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, who were still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had scored two goals to give Leverkusen the lead.
What then happened, impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, according to Glasner.
I am insane happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who had been out since the fourth game and his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was especially happy with a glance at the result, not least for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner will now focus on the upcoming tasks, but he also feels well-positioned regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
Our medical department is doing top-notch work, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now we want to "step by step" continue and remain modest until the end of the year.
Next up is already on Wednesday in the course of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I will receive a B in the mail because of a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get redirected, with no luck.
Can it be sent to me again immediately or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order has to be cancelled again?
It would then unfortunately have to mean that I would not be able to order again since it has already taken too long.
Have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for Handball Women before Quarterfinal against Spain
Germany's handball team slunk away with hanging heads and empty gazes after their humiliating defeat against Denmark.
The German national team suffered a heavy defeat in the final round of the World Championship, losing 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now face Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must approach Spain differently.
After losing their first match in the tournament, Germany finished Group III with 8 wins and 2 losses, finishing second behind the Danish (10 wins).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game for all of us, said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a spot in the semifinals, a significant improvement is needed on Tuesday to keep the dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, who scored six goals.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense - said backcourt player Xenia Smits and challenged: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not on the same level from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the start.
Mistakes in the attack and defensive lapses were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after just seven minutes.
Goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on Betriebstemperature and prevented further damage with some saves.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9 minutes and 30 seconds, when Grijseels finished a quick counterattack successfully.
The expected initial spark was not this, however.
Despite the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women were unable to establish themselves in the game - and when they did, they usually failed in front of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game ended in a 3:10 score after 20 minutes, as Mia Zschocke was shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can still participate.
The German handball team only started to play better in the final minutes of the first half, but by then it was already 5-0.
The already faint hope for a comeback after the switch was already gone after seven minutes with the score of 9:19.
The Green-Yellow Sparrows committed offenses in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a candidate for the medal at the end of the season.
In the following, the German team was unable to further improve their performance and went off the court as a clear loser.

The title is available, I am currently working as an immunization doctor in mobile immunization teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished, it will go on to the next step in the impfzentren for me.
I will answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will the vaccination be compatible with it?").
My area of responsibility includes informing people about vaccination, assessing the indication (person has a right to vaccination according to the CoronaVaccination Ordinance and no reasons to oppose it), documenting the medical records and, if necessary, providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The administration of vaccines can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical caregivers.
In my impfteam we often have no pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but only "inferior" (please, no lack of respect!) impfungen durchführen können (dürfen?), so that I had to do most of the impfungen myself.
Heavy "Hoodlum" Question: Amberger knows the Solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This Amberger dialect word sent in by a viewer has caused much thoughtful reflection in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unidentified in the series "Guess the Host?" this time around.
No, it was not a "nervous man".
And even none, "who has to go quickly".
People were told by the TV moderator that it was completely false.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused much astonishment among many people in the region.
The Houdler, as the viewers learned, is a rag used to wipe the oven.
Antony Rowley, a dialect expert interviewed by the Bavarian Television for years, confirmed it.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine concept, derived somehow from the more widely known Mundart word "Houden".
Through which a educational gap was closed - even for many who have been living in the area Amberg for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for the last two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message is received: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Is choosing tires for a road bike really so puncture-proof?
I woke up this morning full of energy to start my training for my cycling tour next week.
I said, I did it and I cycled with my new racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then it happened, what is waiting in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shattered on the road.
Zach, loud squeaking and my rear tire refused to go any further.
Since I couldn't get a proper replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with less than ideal conditions and turn around and go home again.
It was not quite as bad, perhaps it is better to practice the bike check again before the ride.
Now I am standing before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would not enjoy having to deal with this problem too often.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had given me the bike until 2 pm and had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding them for years) were also worn out.
When I think about having to do a tire change after driving for 80-90 kilometers, I'm really grumpy :D
Now I was talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus Reefs; these should be unplatable.
Now it sounds very attractive.
Are these really unbreakable?
I don't have the will to spend 40€/tire just to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering: I think I'm pedalling my bike 25 times.
There is also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend another type of tire for a cycling race?
The Swallow Page seems to be my absolute! Liewissen eher the Donkey DD to recommend?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!

After the publication of our new High End headphones B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO Series got some new additions.
The new shoot is called SOLO 15 and it resemb # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football.

However, this design includes a foot that is properly aligned to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the given circumstances at home.
Since the Solo 15 is designed for people who require a lower maximum volume, but still want an exceptional sound quality, it is very well suited for them.
A 10 cm speaker is not able to generate nearly unfiltered loud sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Contrary to this, she appears impressively mature and strikingly impressive for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-end boost.
This is commonly done with broadband to reduce the high frequencies and minimize bundling.
The SOLO 15 is aimed exactly at the listening spot and convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high frequency range can be reduced and the sound image warmer shaped by turning the speaker slightly outward.
Thanks to the point-source, the location of each component of a music piece is extremely sharp and amazingly precise.
The suspicion of high reference losses of the B 100 - 6 Ω causes an enemy dynamic that searches for its equal.
The SOLO 15 adds to our SOLO Series not only in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning of the construction process in order to make appropriate adjustments during the building process.
If one wants to, for example, furnish the housing, then the adjustment of the speaker's suspension has to be adapted accordingly, since the furniture adds yet more material.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to run the cable without any problems later.
With the help of an overhead console, the speaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed laterally.
This opening should be faced with a 45° phase in order to maximize the interior opening area of the speaker chassis.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 Ohm get a short circuit in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls in front of them evenly.
These will now be glued to the back, the lid, the front, and the floor.
In addition, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The reinforcements can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example, by using prefabricated frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, both sides, as well as the front.
Through the use of a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex port, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to smooth out all the edges of the actual box.
Even the top of the footrest can be rounded off with it.
In the following step, the bottom plate is glued firmly to the bottom of the housing and additionally secured with long wood screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the case was cleaned of wood dust (absorbing / blowing), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
During this process, the entire and uncut cable is fed through the 8 mm drill hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, and is then allowed to hang out approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there.
Following, the frequency switch will be prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be obtained from the following document: Installation Manual Solo 15.
If the frequency switch has been installed and the connection terminal has been screwed, then the insulation of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is still not completed.
Through the 35 mm × 24 mm × 2.4 mm hole and with a bit of skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the hole and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the equalization according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity is important, so that the + lead (marked cable) must be connected to the + pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex pipe is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe) and inserted.
To dampen sound, a mat of sound-dampening material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I cancel an order and have it delivered in June instead?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio due to familiar reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and the short notice of the announcement.
However: There will be at least three people there, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start about 0:30.
Make sure to have some cold drinks ready, plan good food and get ready for an interesting, long night.
