The item cost less than 20 Euro.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the item's value....
I am a big customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
I need only a number or an instruction to attach my package so that it can be tracked as a return to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249.00€.
It costs her 179€ today.
I find it very angry.
Should I cancel the order and place a new one for the better price or is there another way of refunding?
I also find that one shouldn't impose on children the role of parents for their little siblings.
Nevertheless, I think it is also good for big siblings to help out around the little ones in measure.
Look short, help short, bring the Flasche etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children, I don't see a problem.
When your K1 is occupied for a short time alone and it is OK for him, it is good.
You can best assess whether it fits for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while sleeping.
It is likely to be fragile legally.
Maybe it is also the statement of the psychologist.
If something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to handle.
Whether it is a risk that you want to take is of course your own judgement ;)
Help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer...
The story was about fear and how to therapy.
At the beginning of the story, a Tierpfleger commits suicide by covering himself with food and going to his rabitts' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a Kommissarin who, after a short investigation, is referred to his Therapeut who runs a clinic where he treats Anxiety Patients.
The Kommissarin has a little niece who also has a fear of fire and this Therapeut lands.
There will be more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos online.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center and the patients are put to the extreme in order to overcome their fear.
(A woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death)
This will be referred to as "the battle" in the book.
There will be a great showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the rough action I am sure the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this action is known to someone or if someone were to tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN.
I have to contact my man first.
It can take a while.
What steps must I take then?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years, Chip under the thumbnail.
Child, 4 years, has splinters of wood under the thumb nail (outside).
They tried to draw him with a pinch.
Very difficult to grasp.
It did not work out and caused trouble.
When we attempt to do it, the child reacts hysterically.
No more chance.
We are going to the doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omikron: Johnson will push for a booster shot.
Politics and Science in Great Britain are always dealing with new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an impending offer by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will accelerate the pace of the Corona-Auffrischungsimpfungen in light of the rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that three months have passed since their second vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
The target date was previously set to end of January.
The British Government will also provide additional support so that the immunization campaigns can be accelerated in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish regions.
Johnson said that in the face of the Omikron variant, a notfall was present, therefore immunization must be increased immediately.
The good news is that the immunity level can be raised again with a third immunization dose.
Johnson said, "Let's get boosted now!"
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of Omikron were registered in Great Britain, resulting in a total of 3137.
Compared to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon purchase?
I am in favor of everyone using pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today, an invitation to a conversation was sent by mail.
I will answer the E-Mail.
Unfortunately, his name is not "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I have googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the E-mail now.
Can someone help me?
I am an asylum seeker and I will not step over any officers.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books in total.
4 of them are going.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
It was obvious that the chair had a not visible defect at the sale.
How can a polster damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
We first tried it on the #PRS_ORG#.
It has been working already for approximately.
14 days not more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 more.
However, there was none left.
They are now available and I want to add 2 chairs to the order and bill it to me.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I must write something from the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently due to my profession.
A theme that bothers me a lot and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not help themselves or think we cannot help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
However, there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I'm in such situations where I have to do nothing.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in conversation with the Täter, far beyond my sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
I often wish I could help... in any case, I know I can't.
It will become lighter, but never.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
What does the Netflix series "Arcane" have to do with League of Legends?
There is a lot of Fantasy, many complicated names, an astounding appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been started on Netflix.
Why are we excited for the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick was Verlass on Youngsters.
Nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said, "We still have something anger in our stomachs" after the Pokal defeat in October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim.
She didn't lay down after the game, but instead increased her effort despite the 61:72 (28:38) - loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more was expected than the naked result, the art and manner of the appearance had disappointed.
It shall be called a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The trierate rate was 13%, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at the say and write 31 attempts - any more questions?
John Patrick answered: "We were not concentrated enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and we did not implement what we had trained for."
Thus, to move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "An exciting game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they had to pay for it.
Not only because BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points, but also led his team.
"The best coach I ever trained", praised Gleim still.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the entire line.
In the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and came within eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
Johannes Patrick and Justin Simon both scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is little time for arguing left.
The Riesen will already be hosting the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:19 PM), before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of 750 spectators.
We had an earlier email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have therefore re-written to them.
We originally registered ourselves half a year ago.
Always called: Max Raabe will be 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is traveling with the program "Good Morning, Lovely Luck" - if he can appear.
Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig.
But from that nothing.
The concert that was supposed to take place in May 2022 has been postponed - "due to governmental instruction", in order to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances of his in the Advent season have had to be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 today, and his orchestra (www.palast-orchester.de).
Artists will then try to reschedule their 2020 cancelled performances due to the pandemic from January onwards.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has always sung a lot and enjoyed it as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, 1986 he founded together with his fellow students the Palace Orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene is impossible to ignore.
With the program "Good Morning, Love Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture beforehand?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the color scheme.
It still doesn't work, I can only long for the cover page but not to turn the page.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Through Enteignment, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister for Construction and Urban Development Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as it has been demanded in the Berlin referendum.
"With an Enteignung [nationalization] no new housing is created, only the owner structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security, so that their rent remains affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private renters, cooperatives or housing associations is actually the best protection against a monopoly.
The coalition in Berlin will set up an expert committee to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
If the situation did not improve, Geywitz was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Coalition about further changes in the rent law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent freeze until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in overheated housing markets and the expansion of the rent ceiling.
I will be speaking with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite all efforts, we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners, emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again?
Will it come again?
PRS_ORG with Storage (180 cm x #NUMBER#).
The word "Gutschein" sounds super.
Then I would resolve it independently at the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
When the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
That is an absolute audacity.
At least 100 people died due to tornados in Kentucky.
During an intense storm system, numerous Tornados have moved through the United States.
It is estimated that more than 100 people could have died alone in Kentucky.
The pictures of dort remind of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, in the USA, several tornados have caused severe destruction and possibly up to a hundred casualties.
The storms have left a roughly 320-kilometer-long path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, "Everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone."
Houses, Stores, Government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of Industrial Anlagen, roofs are in the trees.
It is impossible to imagine that it is possible.
He is counting alone in the Commonwealth of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they have sold out the Vitrine #NAME#.
That is very sad.
Is she still produced?
Is she completely out of the product range?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you have to tell them?
If the delivery cannot be made to my Wohnung, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but I can now order the Decke and have it delivered to Germany in the shopping cart?
I had returned the contact form or had given up on it and wanted to inquire whether it had arrived or was being processed, since I had not received any confirmation.
Companies pay immunization fees and change advertising slogans.
While the Bundesregierung is rejecting proposals for an impfprämie, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money prizes for getting vaccinated.
By doing so, they are on the same page as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, which are calling for financial incentives for immunization today.
Even the transformation of slogans to Impfaufrufen - after the German model - should increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He has switched to a company over which he gleefully laughed.
Your situation isn't any better than his.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year.
He had obviously not been successful in seeking something else.
You can also do it.
And that he didn't find you good then: eh, it doesn't matter.
He found his job not good.
There are too many variables.
Please take the Stornation off.
That will then be legally relevant.
I finish a Screen shot.

Help with first own Campaign
Wow, look at that!
I am currently leading an adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised and now I am writing the introduction adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran See.
The further action should take place there.
Some miles from the village, the hero was to be ambushed by a group of goblins.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, acting, threatening, detecting the danger early on, whatever comes up.
Group strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 with Spears, 6 with Bows and Swords equipped.
Unaware of their presence, the Goblins lurk in the Holloway waiting to ambush the Heroes with three archers on either side, while two more stand in their way with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes surrender, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes were all rendered unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The carriage is naturally away.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights intervenes and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight.
The carriage is still there, everything is superb.
How appropriate is Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much for an Adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I hadn't expected so many responses, especially not so many excellent suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee to implement many of your ideas and now I also have more trust in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And again stuck together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore I would like to send her back trotzdem.
Can you then come the receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Suddenly, there was a rip.
I just sat there.
Here was the lower part, also quasi the part with storage damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the garbage bin?
I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1.
Hello lovely F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been steadily decreasing throughout the season, so I thought I'd take a break with this post.
First, the transmission was interrupted midway through the F2 race in order to begin the F1 pre-race coverage punctually.
Although the delayed start and the crash had caused the time plan to be far behind the original plan, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the Championship decision (!).
It appears that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and must therefore be restricted, so that Sky Deutschland had no choice but to comply.
Despite being dumb, Sky UK has ended the race.
Despite a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a rule misunderstanding by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they didn't know that you have to change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was not until Hamilton received the corresponding radio messages that Verstappen was allowed to change his tires.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this opportunity was available for Verstappen.
I believe one should know such basic rules before commentating on a Pay-TV F1 race.
It is not the first Riddle Race that is now allowed or prescribed by the rules, both having constant uncertaint # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football. Bayern Munich participated in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.FC Bayern MunichThe season began with the club winning the 2018 DFL-Supercup, defeating arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1. Bayern Munich went on to win the Bundesliga for the sixth consecutive season, finishing 11 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Werder Bremen. In the Champions League, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the round of 16 by Paris Saint-Germain. In the UEFA Super Cup, Bayern Munich defeated Sevilla 2–1 to win their third
In general, Roos' artificial comment style does not appeal to her, but it is still give to that it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness, which both look unprofessional, as ordering coffee with the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" of Ralf Schumacher.
The last one brings a lot of Unrest in the Comment, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Not only does advertising take over at Sky, but there is no escape from it during the run-off, as only German audio without commentary is available on F1TV after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing it.
These two TV channels do less advertising than Sky, and they are free TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, it does not fully erase the negatives from my mind.
The other programming of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts the F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races it is allowed to broadcast unironically.
Therefore, the amazing F1 season makes less fun than it could with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the #PRS_ORG# Pendelleuchte, Metal and multi-colored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady said it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady said yesterday that she will check and send an E-mail and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already displayed a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I would like support.
Lüfterpumpen are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air hopper.
This series will be offered in 3 variants by us.
Take a look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can compare the performances there.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate an entire facility?
If you have a large aquarium, you should get pumps with two or more outlets, so that you can connect multiple water circulators.
The MK Series has one, two or four exits, depending on the model. However, you can also find an air curtain (in our shop) or a decor which transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, mussel or similar to call.
The MK-Series has a special soundproof construction, resulting in low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The Lüfterpumpe is connected to an Austrodyne air hose...and it can already start.
The fan should be level, or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the water level is lower than the pump, a back-pressure valve should be installed between them.
Cut the air hose and insert the vent between them.
This would prevent it if once the water were to run backward, which would cause the water to be pumped out of the bucket by the pump.
If the Lüfterpumpe is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK Series are pure power packages, consuming little energy.
Even though we have to specify the processing time as 3 days, the packages are still picked up daily and the orders are also delivered daily.
Running brings good luck, going very fast.
We just want to prevent somebody from getting too stimulated, since it took a bit longer than usual.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for the whole staff, which also works in the Speditionswesen...of course, here it does not make any difference with the Corona.
Please don't rate the service bad just because of the delay, it's the courier services' fault.
People like to swear about these services, even though we are saying...they have it really hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Stay healthy and we all hope it will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrest?
Could one also order the feet here?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is sending his daughter, an astronaut, and a moderator into space.
The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator, and four additional passengers have taken a short space trip.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight occurred in the western US State of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally received the recently selected astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, wearing a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space flight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the short flight after her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his assignments.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed himself enthusiastically.
The Moderator said he would love to go back to the All again.
New Shepard is capable of flying up to 100 km altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies mostly automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, with periods of weightlessness, before it was slowed down and landed by parachute.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no universally accepted international regulation.
It was already the third manned Blue Origin mission: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the founder of De Vries and the substitute chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry has.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting and engaging in the lab. (I have already completed my Organic Chemistry Practicum.)
I had also inform myself about the job prospects before studying, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely have to study until the promotion.
Currently, I am struggling with doubts, especially overwhelming me are the job prospects.
On the one side (Studycheck etc) one always hears about super job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other side one always hears about unemployed biologists and unbelievably low paying jobs.
That would really interest me:
What are you working on now?
Are you satisfied with your work/pay?
What did you study/ What education did you make?
Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering either to quit my studies and pursue an apprenticeship as a software engineer.
If you have experiences, write them down :)
Additional Stress Before Ferien and Holiday Weekends
This topic came up last week at my place.
I had to use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore, now a pole is needed.
Not only do we have to deal with big holidays, like Christmas, but there is also a lot of stress in the workplace.
It appears there are holidays plus bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was Mary's Ascension, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day on Fridays.
Last weekend was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
What happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be finished before the weekend, tasks here and there, everything had to be done before the long weekend.
Why... why?
Why does it sound like it's not allowed after so much time?
Why do people want to accomplish so much in a short week as if it were a normal week?
Not only was I then stressed, but also really nervous.
What is this self-hostage for holidays?
Why do we still need Feiertage if we can't properly enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independently so.
My question is: Are we so, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical Art?
Do you know it in the Norden too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is excited about Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has yet to receive any presents.
Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one can still go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will join in the fun by baking cookies and baking with her son.
Catterfeld said, "I love it."
Until the sober days she still had to accomplish: "For the first time I have no gifts, I must finally unpack".

Nekton-Bio gives the bird a smooth and gleaming feather.
Most of the feather damages that occur in the bird holding are due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of a protein-rich material, a perfect feather coat requires a particularly adequate and balanced protein nutrition of the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient Vitamins, Minerals, and Trace Elements.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during the Mauser are due to inadequate or uneven protein intake and/or deficient vitamin and mineral supplementation.

DDR-Handarbeitsmodel Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the loco was in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland in service, the very rare loco probably comes from the model railway magazine ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and parts see photos, functioning good, The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy goods-train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the schlesian network, possibly comes from the small-scale firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being restored operational.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to propose an electric locomotive that could haul 2.200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
As the highest speed, 65 km/h was required.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to procure a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered with the numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and eventually found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk in Dessau, the readiness for overhaul of all six locomotives was established.
As the need for electric locomotives for the heavy freight train service increased with the progress of reelectrification of the Mitteldeutschland network, three locomotives E 95 01-E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, while the other machines were used as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 parts that were available in larger quantities were preferred for construction.
When it became clear at the E 94 that the processing number could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus of the processing.
First, the locomotives were stationed at the Bahn yard in Leipzig.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P in 1960.
They were usually stationed in a separate timetable before the coal trains from the Geiseltal heading towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
It proved to be increasingly difficult to control the locomotives with age.
It often happened that the Safety Officer got stuck at Health and Safety meetings.
Then the Beimann who always had to travel with the locomotive had to unlock the shutter during the journey, using a hammer and a wooden wedge.
Damage to the Fahrmotors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new build locomotives available and no plans for a significant expansion of the electric operations. Therefore, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter gattungen, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to staff electric locomotives with a single person only, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on October 5th, 1970.
The forthcoming new name 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives, including the E 95 02, were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it in a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
She had belonged since then to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) is taking care of the locomotive in a museum-like way.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was first presented to an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external livery, while the transformers were checked and five traction motors were found to be operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their reliable engine and minimal maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to join the mid-German networks.
The primary area of operations was initially Schlesien.
This H0 model is in OVP, functioning well, it needs optical repairs to the loco in self-work, dusty, with play marks, cellar smell!!!, a very rare hand-crafted model, a very small edition- possibly from ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages can have labels and trace evidence on them.
The F-Parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle balken is held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the balken cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle balken is held by two feet, these are unfortunately defective.
The middle balcony does not fit into the designed holder.
I also get new sent.
When will they be sent?
No flat.
According to the Montage Instructions, the correct ones were too narrow.
But that's not important.
Mainly they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat at my place.
Could I have received these?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
A house fire with two lightly injured and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a valuable damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the Police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
According to the reports, two people were taken to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, the police did not rule out arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
She eventually came, but much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To Strengthen Fake News - Biontech CEO Publishes Vaccination Photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first immunization in 2021.
Biontech-Chef Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his immunization status.
The entrepreneur published a photo of himself getting the Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to share with Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him getting a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was unvaccinated.
In actuality, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the LinkedIn network.
"My friends have been urging me to post a picture of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors."
So far he has rejected it, because the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a call in the previous week had changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine was currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a breathing machine for three weeks.
His schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He didn't ask after the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by incorrect information and doubt.
It is difficult to combat anxiety with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Uğur Şahin from Deutsche Welle has been circulating on the internet, in which he says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment, according to the law," said Şahin then.
There is a prioritization of vaccinations in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been long forgotten - and the Biontech Chief has reportedly been vaccinated three times.
Fire in Substation: 10,000 people without Power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no more power and in many cases, therefore, no heating.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhineland-Palatinate region of North Rhine-Westphalia were without power for 24 hours.
Due to the fire, 41,000 affected inhabitants and inhabitants had their lights go out in several municipalities on Friday evening.
Westnetz reported that numerous backup power sources had been in operation until the widespread outage was finally completely fixed late Saturday night.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered places of refuge in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and thanked the helpers for their effort.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the Kreis, the firefighters and the THW for their untiring effort", said the head of the Primary Technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages would take some days, since the Westnetz-Monteurs had to firstly put some cables back in operation provisionally.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company statements.
The current is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 PM has severely damaged the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There are expensive cleaning and repair works needed.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt power supply plane was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power back.
Another 20,000 people from Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been switched on gradually at 21.30.
Since 11:55 PM, even the last ones still affected by the outage had power.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner firms were involved.
The authorities had called for Neighborhood Help after setting up a Power Supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or isolated people and inform the local fire station when help is needed, as explained by Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power sources, the residents of nursing homes were the main focus.
In addition, according to official reports, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical supervision.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them at you and pay in Euro?
It is about the sky in blue-green.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the understructure on the tabletop.
It is about #NAME#.
That gives 3 executions.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155 cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, however I cannot squeeze it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return them, since they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive feedback.
That is really easier!
Then let's do it!
Do you want to send me the return receipt by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried it before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find it almost unbelievable that the discount is so low.
That is not agreeing.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins.
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
They had to surrender again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already left the ski jumping far behind him.
Return the Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
We both made a new version and are using it 4.5...
It could be that she has already heard of the problem.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be there.
I want to open the door, but the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
They can report a possibly faulty file at the Customer Service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
The chat connection is away and now?
I have to work in between!
In order to obtain a even and clean Farbauftrag, you should clean the parts with some soap and water, remove the dust, fat and fingerprints with clear water, then dry it.
Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the later not visible inner side of the components or on a Yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers ensures a even surface later.
Avoid rapid here and there wiping with the brush.
This leads to the creation of unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones could appear later.
Metallic tones and colors come together at the end with a separate brush.
It can become unattractive metal flakes when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry overnight before you varnish them.
The models can achieve an original appearance through the Decals or Transfers.
From Aircraft Registration Marks to Ship Names, Car Emblems and Registration Plates: Decals Give Models the Final Touch.
Bring the Decals in the correct order, as long as the Bauteile are still accessible.
A cockpit of a plane can be installed or easier be fitted before it is put into the body of the plane.
More important than the right tool like a saw, pincers and a dentist are when gluing time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and lay it down for you.
Decals are also known as Water Transfer Images, because you can quickly dampen their back side with water until the paper becomes dark.
Then you can slide the picture only a little bit of paper and put it on the appropriate place on the model (which you also wet before).
While you are holding the decal on the model with a tool, you are pulling the carrier paper sideways away.
Always check to make sure the picture is securely in place before you attempt to remove it from the paper, to prevent it from sticking to your finger, knitting, or tearing.
Excess water should be absorbed with a mop.
This is not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book for a short time, if I look then I don't read the book and have to log out and login and load the book again and search for the place until I have read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this email?
Is it possible to get all 3 packages?
For the lamp came in 3 separate packages at my place.
Thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back problem-free?
Infertility Treatment for PKV / What is an "Insurance Claim"?
Hello together,
We were in infertility treatment for a while, but now that it's time to deal with the Statutory Health Insurance, it suddenly puts up a fight.
In order:
We had applied for the IVF treatment in advance at the PKV and were successful with 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was deducted from the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with IVF yet.
We applied again for cost sharing with the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had more experiments than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 experiments (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 experiments.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second desire for children should be a new insurance case.
According to AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the treatment requirement no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right to only give 3 attempts for the PKV or us (it is 5 attempts to be given)?
Would the PKV have had to point us in the Zusagen to the fact that with a birth the further experiments would have fallen?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could share their opinion.
Thank you already for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants per email and tell me how I can best achieve them.
In Order.
We will not order anything more at them.
When they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can forward it to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague said to me that the repayment was initiated and now they are saying that I have to first send the thing back.
I can't do anything about it if the Kommode shows up at my place completely disorganized.
Can you please see what the colleague wrote in the Screenshot?
It is clear and evident that the repayment was triggered and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two Stamm customers.
My friend has also ordered diverse furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not be doing that anymore.
No, the defect appeared only after a few months.
A chair must be able to withstand normal usage.
They are not allowed to sell him as a chair.
Independent of that, the guarantee applies for 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will take the schrank apart and make it available to the transportation company.
Good day, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# series.
These products can be purchased with additional to purchase chairs, but we can not find them at your place.
Can they help?
Weekly Topic: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find a plethora of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What bothers you?
What don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the graue Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time was extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat, where one must wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give it another try, since it doesn't work here.
Hello
Half victory against Belarus is associated with high cost for the EU.
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs were however high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation, according to the researcher of the Berlin-based SWP.
This win-win situation - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably still go on for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
It appears that there is a "growing normalization of Pushbacks" by certain EU Regierungen.
Since the EU as a whole did not seem to be decisive against it, it would come at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens simultaneously the cohesion in the Union.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a member state decides to go its own way, as is the case with Poland, which even refuses access to its border to the EU's border control agency Frontex."
In addition to paying for its policy on the border with Belarus, the EU has had to pay another price, as Bossong explains: It has become more difficult to reach an agreement on the Asylum policy, as the line "Border control, Border control, Border control" has been strengthened.
Attempting to cross the border again.
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to illegally enter Poland from Belarus.
55 migrants were apprehended in the night of Saturday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officers were attacked by the migrants with stones near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically attended to by a military doctor.
In total, the Grenzschutz registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border controls.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukashenko of being a dictator in Minsk, luring him with the prospect of being able to travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines for bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent their departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its resolve by applying hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account innerpolitical costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely to be in favor of the security apparatus regularly herding thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting the controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspected of two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the Year.
A protest is related to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car Phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes's view, the protocol was not regulation compliant.
Max Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton on the last lap of the race and had won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car Phase, in which the Niederländer overtook the car in front of him.
I am checking it.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the Support.

I had then already a huge argument with you, when I ordered the #Presto# commode.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold out Blue Note on Friday and also moderated the event.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and is attentive to the nocturnal sounds at her door.
I gave the contact form to return the article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be, has my Anfrage been completed?
Not everyone has the time for your broken chat and wrongly delivered Bargainware from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all from our household.
Contact #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday that I (or #NAME#) would receive an email with a 60 Euro discount code, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# Nightstand, and a "return to sender" label.
This E-Mail has not arrived so far.
The package wants to still bring to #PRS_ORG#.
Please contact me.
With friendly greetings

Sorry, but only because he says he is not an Antisemit does it mean nothing.
That is like when an AfDler says he has nothing against Aslans.
You will have to give it up to both of them.
However, Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-semitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself then one should just leave it completely.
You're similar to him in taking him seriously.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply lost.
God has brought the whole thing into motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And thus you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal vision field, the Lupe should be positioned as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the Lupe practically distortion- and color-free even in the edge zone.
Loupes are often marked with magnification ratings.
These conditions apply only to exact specifications that are rarely the user conditions.
In order to use your Lupe optimally, please take into consideration the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (See User Manual in the package).
On the surfaces of all optical devices - even incident light - reflections are created.
Through the application of an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - a magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English languages).
Zeiss VisuCard Lupe = Magnifying Glass, Scheckkartenlupe = Credit Card Magnifying Glass, Vergrößerung = Enlargement, Taschenlupe = Handheld Magnifier, Leselupe = Reading Magnifier, Lesehilfe = Reading Aid
Whether as a reading aid for on the go or simply for the everyday miniscule: The Zeiss VisuCard is the ideal helper, since it can be taken anywhere due to its handy format.
And their tough exterior makes them resilient against special strains in the old days.
Each Lupe comes with a check card holder for storage and safe transport.
They offer these parts, which they can see in the pictures or under "What do they offer" is described.
What condition is the offered article in?
Everyone can make a mistake once in a while, since no one is free from errors - if this happens, just send a message and it will be settled to everyone's satisfaction (either through exchange, partial refund or full refund).
They will receive an ordinary bill.
It will be sent always, when not explicitly requested otherwise by the buyer, insured with tracking number via DHL!
Please take the shipping costs from the above shipping conditions.
There will be no further handling costs.
Everyone says they are authorized, how can I check it more precisely?
Yes, the email address.
I will do it very nice and good service, although it took time until one could talk to a person, they were super.
Hello love #PRS_ORG# Team,
I have already registered under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it said before.
You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees.
Frank Diers, the landwirt, has experienced many odd situations during his Christmas tree sales.
Once a man even had to return home without his partner, because they couldn't agree.
He plants there about 2000 pieces every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
The Christmas season always does something fun, he says.
What does that have to do with the Gutschein?
Am I as a customer away?!
Although I received a defective delivery, I had to pay the full price for it.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to lead discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat, which is grilled on a spinning spit.
And both have therefore their name.
On German it would be equivalent to something like the "Dreher", which is far from delicious.
Problems with Glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new Glass Fiber Anschluss in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly 50 Mbit received and sent.
The new Glasfaser connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, at the other DLan Modul, which transmits WiFi, not more the full 500 an, but rather as I move further away with the Modul, lesser comes an (so I use a power outlet, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other Modul).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new Glasfaser connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which appears to be using a new technology.
Although this was better than DLan, it also suffered similar large losses.
Could someone explain why so much Internet speed is lost over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to install LAN cable in that house.
I am really at my wit's end, so I created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted with an answer.
When it's time to change the Girokonto.
Who would have thought that there would be peace at the Giro accounts now, sees himself fooled.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases, negative interest rates continue to erode customers' savings.
For example, Deutsche Bank used to be considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 Euros.
She has just halved her Freibetrag and even quartered her Tagesgeld.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank concession - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts, and to 25,000 euros for Tagesgeld accounts.
However, these lower freiboard levels now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 Euros, which is still valid, as well as for the ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB has reduced its free withdrawal limits in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
Despite this: More than 100 banks have according to the Internet portal Verivox currently a bonus of up to 25,000 Euro or less.
Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 Euros: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there between the bank and the consumer centers, which won the first instance court case against this regulation at the Landgericht Berlin.
Now banks are discussing whether they should form rebates - in case the upper instances declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and have to repay many millions to bank customers.
The table was delivered for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people.
The underbelly is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston has employed an entire Beauty Army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Although your life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, 2021 was the year of the "Friends" revival and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show". This success is primarily due to their discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers are dedicated to perfecting your appearance.
Even though, as Aniston, they're going to get themselves a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
That you can capture the hearts of both female and male fans equally is really remarkable.
Perhaps, because she is simply unlucky with the luck - and still searching for the great love.
And he removed the baby wish from the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked didn't have a clue what was going on with me personally, medically, why I couldn't.
It was really injurious.
Keep hoping that success and fame will make you happy.
Unsupportive End of a Career: Räikkönen has to abandon.
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42 year old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light tire rub, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Great Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the Formula 1 Motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also gone to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the F1 World Championship 2007 with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole, and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I have calculated it, I need to win nine and a half races in a season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by 50%, moving up from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material settings and drove on the Sunday with 0.30 seconds a greater lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was third.
"We have taken a greater risk today and were rewarded. Friedrich, who also added his 22nd consecutive victory."
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving to Stuttgart, came in second place this time.
Christopher Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in fourth in the first race and ended up in eighth place.
If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season's victory in the two-woman bob.
After coming in fourth the day before, she raced with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to a World Cup victory on Sunday.
Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen, who won the Olympic two-woman bobsled title, came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded her Olympic qualification as well as her first podium place in this winter.
The Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It is not only about pushing, but there is also a lot of work to be done around it".
Jamanka was slightly annoyed by the not quite error-free journeys, but she said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the Decke in my shopping cart and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive him and therefore couldn't cash it in, so I finally inquired.
Last year, due to Corona, I had different problems and no time for them.
And now it was said that he had expired which made me very angry.
They were discussing the Asare Chair in the chat.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is reduced :)
Why will the shipping start on March 16th?
Nothing was listed on your website with a longer delivery time.
No, unless I come extra field with the message.
Your colleague took it away yesterday.
Why is it today a problem?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
However, we would still like to get the dresser, just a new, unbroken one.
You can't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have something I want to write and maybe it will help the one - or the other...
I am 24, have a full-time job, a student and a dog - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to the kindergarten, he is pretty much 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, has gotten a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him and we kissed a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him while showering (because Hand is in the band wg burn).
He is also cold and we are seeing each other less (1-2x week) which is bothering me a lot with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is feeling bad, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his comforter and has relaxed a bit after I pet him and turned on the heating pad.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now comes also the homework on us, which we will divide.
Even cooking is too much work for me...
My Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is currently in a good place, I am halfway through therapy and am managing okay.
Not good, but I come right and am almost symptom-free.
My university requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not prepared anything, and the next day I should at least prepare something for the Anatomy class.
Next week I have a spoken exam on Dienstag, and then whatever comes up is written down in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
My week is going like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on further?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the vacation beginning.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on eternally.
I believe I am just stressed out enough to need these mental anchors, otherwise I will pack it in.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't seem to...
Does it also go for you?
I am endlessly grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinite, thankful, but I can't express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think it has something to do with the Mental Load that women carry and that's why I thought I could find suffering sisters here...
I wish you at least one restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today unfortunately it is the other color plus the surface is scratched and the table top has a print.
The first delivery was exactly the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
When we are going to change the table, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In other words, twice.
She was confirmed but not.
Nothing was the same: I noticed in school that many Religions teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like Math or Geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you stand it?
You could also tell stories about your colleagues from work and school with different attitudes.
I generally understand the difference between private and professionally and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the relativity theory.
Why would someone want to teach religion if they don't believe?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English if you understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would abandon it.
It is good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support.
Help please with movie search.
Hello love people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for youthful people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First the Modern (real world).
On the other hand, the Past (or the Dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from The Curse of the Black Pearl).
From some unknown reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Realm of the Dead who is bringing the woman to this realm in order to be able to live.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
I believe the soldiers are fighting against each other.
If it says something to you, I am thankful for every answer.
Our Little One has only slept on the belly since Week 1.
Fast forward: lives still :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, often go in and look, but no minutes surveillance.
That makes you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Mattress.
No Kissen.
They had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it raise something from the stomach?
Is it lying face first in the mattress?
You can infer whether everything is all right from this.
We have all grown and my husband has been born, it was a crazy time and there was no one to put the kids on the belly to sleep.
Besides, we are already "Stam customer" for you and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response.
It's about my closet, which arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the chest.
I would please you to contact me quickly.
The chest is not to be used at the moment.
Um it to be quite clear.
RBTV promised much.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had fun with RBTV as well.
It's simply the case that the politics of this sender have become quite saucy.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a great Begun Tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: He wanted to be "no running billboard".
What is one now?
A 0815 Werbesender, who is trying to sell his BilloMerch to the Elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Dos & Don'ts.
They apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They can obviously continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy entirely and tries to pass off the exploded rental rooms as ash.
How can one find everything good?
It's great when it suits you, I find it horrible.
I would like to return the item, as it has arrived defective.
The PRS_ORG has been damaged in the delivery.

Darmstadt lose second place - Pauli win in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation battle.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third trainer.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late win in the decisive game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start with new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) could not be charged anymore through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a Netzteil alone is enough for operation.
Error, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore even with the plugged in power adapter.
Afterwards, I took apart the battery, but even here nothing happened.
Have you got any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use my laptop in the network operation?
Is there anything else wrong?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I know it's white, but I don't know how high the seat is.....
Are you always on tour and yet still carrying a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
This 20-liter capacity can swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold-Trays.
And whatever else you need for everyday items, remains well organized and separable from the photo gear inside.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The minimalistic design of the backpack is a proverbially - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has created some of the most innovative solutions to protect the interior of the backpack while still granting access to the photo gear in an instant.
It works with two possibilities: Either conventionally through the lid latch, which can be secured with the MagLatch-Verschlusssystem, or with an excellent thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself at the Messenger Bags.
Inside the Verschlussklappe is a metal Verschlusshaken with appropriate Ankerbalken on the Front side of the Rucksack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has taken into account different “fill levels”: there are four Anker brackets, sturdily riveted, into which the Verschluss handle can be inserted.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top balcony, if it is rather empty, you take a deeper one.
The Klappenverschluss and Haken are also magnetically.
The rucksack can also be securely closed without the hook.
The second option differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other, Fotorucksacks: Besides the Deckelklappe, there is also a zippered opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to rummage through the contents anymore!
This clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the rucksack: If you are carrying not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear as well.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior separately (more below) and so store them separately - and through the two side openings also access them independently.
You can also pull the rucksack from the right side, so that you can reach the camera equipment in the right main pocket, while the daily items stay safe in the left rucksack pocket and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable harnesses help.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof Nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it is going to Scotland in the fall.
I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# confirmed my appointment yesterday via email.
Spedition has announced an contact attempt to retrieve the wrongly delivered table.
Until now I have not received any message.
I would like immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support staff, with none of them I went further than the promise that I would get an email as confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It is then to be seen when the chest could be delivered again?
Retaining him is not an option...
It works.
Many thanks for the help.
I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment were on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the Gutschein, I will immediately place a larger order, but nevertheless I have kept the damaged furniture and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected was something I couldn't anticipate and couldn't resolve in time.
However, I as a customer do not accept the damage.

The glasses made in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the plate, while scratches improve the cleaning of brake shoes and brake clamps.
The aesthetic features of our tuned glasses emphasize their attractive and remarkable appearance, thereby highlighting the character of each car.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In Winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern bend of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the land.
Areas were delineated, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost appeared overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the West and hoping to make a name for yourself.
You will be searching for gold, recruiting workers, breeding horses, and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjoining areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must exceed your Pioneer colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose to simultaneously build your actions, must maintain your resources and create a Tableau which works more and more for you (so-called “Engine Building”).
Your tableau buildings allow you to become more efficient, to obtain additional actions, or to apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can refine your individual style by making fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year when California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board, where they can perform actions.
Then their selection will be revealed and they will place their Pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most Pioneers, it receives a Sperre!
This deactivates the one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players will take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the Pioneers will return.
The Anpreiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This will go on until the Anpreiser has moved five times, thus covering every location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout, in which the players Coloma must defend themselves against the wutentfrohen Bandits.
When the players have contributed enough Revolvermen and are numerically superior to the Bandits, they will be rewarded.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most Siegpoints wins!

Why Children Are Not Tyrannical, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD Documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Will Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and their guardians are now leveling heavy accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
I am very grateful that many people have now changed their thinking and acting.
Our parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never use power over the child!
Our aim must always be to give the child a free space for its development and to make the frame as large as it is possible and feasible in the situation.
I'm still shivering.
Countries are discussing the loss of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated people.
The Health Ministers of the Länder will decide on their next meeting about a nationwide abolishment of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people.
We need clarity as soon as possible whether and when thrice vaccinated people can be exempt from the testing obligation, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for triple vaccinations would be "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus to vaccination", said Holetschek.
The Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to propose a plan at the Health Ministers' Conference on the next working day. − afp
I will also send the lamp back.
How do I go there best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, however I cannot see how high the seat height is.
Can you help me further?
I can't handle my #PRS_ORG# shopping anymore.
Announcement: Ups, it is an error that has appeared.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated my Kontodaten.
What can this be lying?
What you describe will be referred to as *Awareness*, which is sensory perceptions under conscious sedation.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
It most commonly occurs to hear sounds, rarely to see images and most rarely to feel pain.
This topic is relevant: C-sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as one must protect the child until the umbilical cord is completely cut off.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the Narcosis conversation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex had it by definition.
I misread her comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us.
These are legal guarantee claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check it again if they can at least take the defective chair back.
We sell the second chair then privately.
We will also lose some money.
I sent you an email which you did not answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to my chosen room.
The Spediteur is a firm #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, must I cancel the order, since I know no one who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question.
Günther Rühle, a renowned theater historian, has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
He wrote a monumental theater history later.
Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading the news arrives that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I hereby express my life's thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Europalette, standardized wooden palettes, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European space.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was at good 79 million Euro.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually, is not raised.

Rolled Beef Tips & Tricks
I had received here last week many excellent tips for the perfect goulash.
There was Christmas and it was delicious and buttery smooth!
Thanks again for it :)
Now I have become accustomed to the taste and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on Silvester.
I will set up a Rinderfund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going on?
What happened to the books? How can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'm getting it.
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed via mail on 18.01. that the refund had been processed.
Although it has not gone yet, my money is still with me.
Would you please check it?
Where there is still Christmas brisket in Lübeck.
For many people, Goose or Duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the presents.
Have they not yet gotten the chicken?
Now the time is tight.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier's output stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of its guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor schematic.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sound.
The amplifiers of the VT+ Series offer a unique Power Level regulator, allowing one to reduce the sound level without affecting anything at the "Gain" or the distortion.
It had already begun to sound like one could tune the POWER LEVEL Regler even to a reserve of power, if it ever got too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regulator, one can utilize the full potential of the VT+ Series in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal hereby attached is processed by a box simulation, so that you will get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
You can connect an AUX input to a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice recognition device.
If you purchase a VFS5 foot pedal, you can conveniently call up the Sounds using your feet, adjust the Effect blocks On/Off, and control the tempo of the compatible Effects.
This is essential for live action.
With its new powerpacks, VOX is taking another step into the future!
He had seen it at others.
Does it then give you the possibility to return the lamp?
Does it hang too low for a dining table?
I would then like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive another update regarding the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a Nachlass or Gutschein instead.
If necessary, I will find a buyer for the furniture.
If the cost of the item is more than 1000 euros, and I don't need it, then it's still something more.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hinge.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded.

Iran sees progress in negotiations over the Nuclear Agreement.
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the talks regarding the revival of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Both sides are about to agree on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", since at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be discussed.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building atomic weapons.
The Wiener talks for the renewal of the agreement had been continued after a week-long break.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - Freistaat is now the Bundesland with highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only Bundesland, it lies above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen was the only German state to have a higher Corona Incidence than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 7-day value of 1025 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which always had the highest incidence nationwide, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but it was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, there were 2242 new cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths due to infection within a day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively medical on Sunday in hospitals.
On weekends, there can be delays in registration.
Furthermore, the Health Departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand it.
Since the delivery is scheduled to begin in March, it is perhaps until then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the package and then give it to the post, right?
Must I click/give/fill further?
I want to avoid it, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return to sender at my own cost.
I consider 8 euro Rücksendegebühr to be a fraud.
It is time for changes.
The Bundestag has greeted me, I am in StratorDE in the Plenarsaal in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the post here?
When one looks back at the activities of the past months of the Bundestag, one can conclude that it is not extinct.
We have gotten into a winter stalemate and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
What happened?
It is likely that this is simply due to the general Unzufriedenheit, as some things have gone wrong here and we are generally standing.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many are still really excited about the Bundestag.
What we need to change.
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking which one of them wants to keep it alive.
The spark was from u/edizVEVO, who had become aware of this project in the last days and found a shattered mess.
After several rounds of revising and editing, a few people from the community have found the desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to also call for participation once more, only then can this project have a future existence.
We have created a Discord server to exchange ideas and work on concrete things.
You can join the server by clicking on this link.
Goals: Stanford University: School of Medicine: Medical Faculty
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we appear outside in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten a few things, but it's not too bad, we have Discord at the end.
When you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together, and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a Lamp Shade from you, which still needs to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for dafür and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different hanging for you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad over it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Does the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# come in Large, for example 240/240?
PRS_ORG must guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be removed quickly.
And I please you, that now to initiate.
I haven't got a suitable packaging, but I'll try to take the shelf apart as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it will work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to arrange a pickup date.
Is there an instruction for the installation?
How long would I have time to obtain these or decide to return them?
Why are you vegan?
I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live vegetarian for a while, but now eats meat only occasionally.
I was a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and Vegetarianism a planned transition, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought that by being a vegetarian I would be supporting the animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to go vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that they were feeling Missmut on their side, they defended then Vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and how Vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "plump".
How do you answer the question?
I feel like being a Veganer quickly gets you stuck in a corner and conflicts arise without you wanting it to happen.
A veganerin who loves harmoniously greets (;
It is not an exception after § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am at the assigned date, when #PRS_ORG# requires me to pick up my return.
Since I cannot be there for the funeral, it cannot be changed.
Can you please assign me an alternative Abholterm?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards, I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 Euros to Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte for a new rescue boat for the volunteer fire department.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in deployment since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 Euro.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rheinland-Pfalz is supporting us in this endeavor, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill tasks both above and below water in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, people are used to dealing with increasing investments: The boom of the hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Mosel rivers, as well as the further growth of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read for 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations however synchronized, removed and reloaded the App nothing worked.
I am frustrated because the whole action has taken much time and I hope for help now.
It is then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I input a date/time in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and with the installed 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thanks first and foremost for taking the time to get involved in this, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar capacity, speaking we were also Waffenträger in the executive, furthermore I do not wish to elaborate!
I always find the question of rights and lefts very simplistic.
Generally, one should say that the State employee is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Naturally, also in the special Uniform and Waffenträger people should be right from conservative magically anziehen should also everyone be clear, that these people then naturally with the lived reality have difficulty, because you have naturally beside the average white, nowadays many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and that I mean not the overly feminine cliché-gays, because these people are in the executive rather less to none and then normal men and women whom one does not notice when they tell them). And also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or set this for you.
However, even these marginalized groups tend to have a conservative attitude, as they are proud of Germany and feel undermined by overzealous left-wing policy, even if this policy is supposedly trying to help them. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since of course police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, which however openly express their opinion there or even openly plan any state-threatening plans, which media is completely exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers, who have often been on an overseas deployment, to begin to stereotype and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right-leaning like-minded people will meet and engage in an intellectual exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it will be successfully combatted and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
I didn't understand it, so I ordered it from the other corb on the Deutsche Seite.
Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I had chatted before with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# organization a black bag for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany or it is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only Sie as partner firm.
However, above the edge of the wooden part are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow.

What is the ordinary way through a child?
Hello, I have been occupied by a thing for longer.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but for my entire life I have been getting it more wrong than right when it comes to my household cleaning and organization.
There are always phases in which everything stagnates, and then and again I get caught off guard and clean up and put things in order.
However, it is actually never the case that someone would spontaneously come to visit.
My Man is (unfortunately) also not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly loses household easily against work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we want to cook.
Have you been able to become more orderly with your children?
We have not done it yet but have been working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
For me, there is no incentive to do it, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visitor and always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Does one need a larger incentive or remain one sloppy?
I'm looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and quality higher plus anatomically formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and allows so a nearly unrestricted movement freedom.
Pre-Formation with specialized, further Molding at the joints for improved Movement Freedom (at Arm and Knee Bending)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area was more than doubled with the Flex System 2 in order to enhance the comfort further.
Nahtlose Stretch Panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-formed moldings in the lower back area and step provide a snug, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the Lenden-wirbel area increases flexibility by the Rear-release buckle and improves comfort, especially when bending and attaching/mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and the back guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
When positioned on the breast, it can bring warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
No seam, thin (0.2 mm) sealing at the face on the hat increases the comfort, sealing and reliability (separate hat).
A soft, flexible zone located in the kragen area improves the sealing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a lockstitch, which does not stick to the casing or the stitches.
Double-layered arm and leg joints are connected with a adjustable inner sleeve and a weather-resistant, padded outer sleeve.
The 45° V-shaped groove at the end of the inner manshield provides increased elasticity and load-bearing when fastening.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the Overall without a Hat.
Longer G-Lock P Rear Release Buckle (Without Hat) with Metal Slide and Integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Reißverschlüsse on Arms and Feet
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the reissverschlüsse, to prevent ripping if too much force is applied.
Neoprene Panels were glued together with external and internal overlapping.
The edges of the outer sleeves were seamed for greater durability.
The edges of the inner-manschets were beveled for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-computer models).
Can I pursue a career in social work with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I have completed a training in the field of Software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this job is not the right one for me, so I have been contemplating starting again and studying social work.
The Problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) Personality Disorder (APD).
It roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a sachistic level, but it is difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told that I am unapproachable (though I think I have become better at it).
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather not work as a Streetworker or in an open youth meeting but rather in substance abuse counseling or family services.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete workday is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS has already caused problems in my job (emotionally), as it downgrades me every time something is wrong with my code ("just simple things I've broken") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how it goes"/"I'm making a fool of myself with my questions"/"he must think I'm underqualified").
I will probably have problems in every job but I wanted to mention it there.
Did they return the sofa?
Because there was also no confirmation.
I am waiting for a term for pickup.
What do they mean by return it please!
When I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message that your #PRS_ORG# has not authorized this book.
Are there problems there?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my schrank.
The protein (Eiweiß) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its Magen-Darm-Trakt into the individual Eiweißbausteine (Aminosäuren) and rebuilt from these again into its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation of the nestling and the feather renewal of the molting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the organism as a whole.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during the breeding season, as it may cause disturbances in the breeding process.
After this routine gift of NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin supplement with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral supplement).

1 gram NEKTON Bio per 250 ml water or 100 grams of weichfood.
It is advisable to only prepare as much Trinkwater/Weichfood as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A sterilized measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON Bio.
At strong feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until feather growth is completely finished.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be dry and without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C, stored.
Please excuse them, but the chair is being sold as an executive chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany last for 24 months.
This is really very bad service.

Statement of a Gemeinder worker in contradiction to the Satzung
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman
I have the following problem.
Our ground should have a Walnut tree felled.
Also a Fällantrag to the Gemeinde has been submitted.
A worker wrote to me that pruning of fruit trees and thus the Walnut is not part of the regulation.
In the Satzung, however, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the worker or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the Satzung is clearly defined.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Naja, then I still have a sofa without usage.
Could you offer me a Nachlass or a Gutschein?
What were they more expensive?
I believe it, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euro and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you check it?
Emergency notification: serious traffic accident at Selb
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord interchange and Plößberg.
How the police press alarm is currently informing (2:03 PM), a car has been overtaken in the wrong direction.
There are injured.
I understand.
Good, thank you again, that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career life.
First, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre, because my beloved head is currently denigrating everything it can.
Before I start here now, I need some advice.. in short: I need help from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the reffing as a Quereinsteiger.
I originally studied something else and worked in that area (so as to at least be anonymous, I won't specify anything more here).
It was all too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
Eventually I landed in the teaching profession and was sure it - even though the framework conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but it was not important.
I have arrived at the third "I am googling other job postings" place.
And it is only half a year.
Before the males I always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, then I can still switch.
I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Although there are ferien, there is still a hufen of work that is waiting for me.
Before the exam I always thought I was stress-resistant, but it was my weekend and my celebration.
I had free time.
And the stress on the job was equal in the moments.
Now it's too much stress for me.
And then there are these static structures that bother me additionally.
Generally it is fun and from the outside it looks like the review is going well, which is related to feedback.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't do it already.
I'm asking myself whether I want to keep doing this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of your contributions -, or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, took free time when I needed it, and the work was boring but adequately paid and we worked together as a team and not as a lone ranger like it is now most of the time.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back at the same place next year and unhappy.
You know it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you have as outsiders advice or ideas, how I can get out of this situation, I'm completely finished and I start to cry with the smallest thought.
I will now make decisions emotionally, which is likely to lead to nothing good.
But maybe your views can help me to at least see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which would be enough for now.
Thanks for reading and apologizing for the weepy tone of my message.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since their introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously improved, resulting in a combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scheme, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new Modeling Engine, which is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps of course contain the more complex Valvetronix tube preamp.
This relies in part on real analog circuits, as these capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this intricate circuitry, VTX amplifiers offer a closed enclosure and a Bassreflex system, from which the natural resonances can only be heard sprouting.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can adjust historical facts on the virtual plane until the Amp and Effects sound the way you always wanted.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Naturally, she has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 resulted in a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series - with more dynamics and numerous, significantly improved amplifiers.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series ranges from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, so that Guitarists can find the maximum sound variety they are searching for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fatter sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the Endstufe particularly influences the Röhrencharakter of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology accordingly.
The 12AX7 tube-loaded Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA is still going on.
The Wagner Brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The great main focus is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Klettverschluss-Teilers it adjusts to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes up to full-frame reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the rucksack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses, and an on-camera flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
Besides, one can still store a lot of accessories.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photography-unfriendly items.
Pilots of drones often make the optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, since it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro along with its remote control and accessories.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Kanaren island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest known in the history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the West Coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data about earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has recently decreased, but volcanologists are still hesitant to make any predictions as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV-sender RTVE.
Damage in million-dollar range
In the three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava flow.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million Euros.
Before the coast, two new landmasses were created by a lava flow, with a total size of about 50 hectares.
The banana production, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly affected by the volcanic eruption. Approximately half of the 85,000 inhabitants of the island depend on it either directly or indirectly, and it was already in a crisis before the eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were heavily affected, as reported by the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is standing at the door and the children can hardly wait for it.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the tingling suspense to create something alluring.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that can still bring our divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas gift-giving tradition, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "social contract" between primitive peoples, can be freed from the rigid routine and refilled with life.
How Nikolaus became the Christkind.
In strict terms, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days so closely with the gift-giving.
On St. Nicholas Day, gifts were either given to one another or received.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women a bag of gold through their window in one night to save them from sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular custom of filling the Stiefel (shoes) with gifts especially for the children in Germany.
Protestants were offended by this practice, as they considered it to be "idolatry".
These reasons are why they are resisting the institution.
Martin Luther transformed the Nikolaus into the Christkind and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas Day.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detail questions so seriously, it annoys only a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas is similar to that of Martin's with Martin's Singing and Procession still being a firm part of the Christmas season.
Today, you can find shoes by the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to highly desirable luxury watches, all of which the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas's Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful chaos over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who has acquired certain characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white Rauschebart, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his slew, which is pulled by Rentiers, and the preference of the chimney, in order to obtain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus Child.
In Scandinavia sometimes bring mythical creatures the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not Rentiers, but three horses that are pulling the slew.
In Tschechien, the Motherland of Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is responsible for the gift giving.

The police shot an alleged bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The Police informed that a caller had reported a man with a weapon had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
The man fled, according to the Behörden, in a vehicle which was later stopped by the Beamten.
It were shots that fell and the man were hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Around Kensington Palace, there are several embassies located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family live there as well.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually dangerous objects from remote galaxies that glow inwardly.
Quietly, in contrast, is "Smart Stone": All alone the sun makes it glow fascinatingly – optionally in white or colored light (in 6 different hues).
The amorphous, shapeless design is consciously chosen: How a naturally formed larger pebble presents itself as this modern light object during the day.
His organic circles fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also makes himself great in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his greatness.
Great preparations can save you money: As a Solar light, 'Smart Stone' requires neither wiring nor batteries.
Set the "Leuchtstein" at any sunny place.
Two spikes provided by the delivery man ensure stable footing if needed.
The matt white plastic shell is robust and weatherproof.
Its Solarmodul hides a »Smart Stone« discreetly within its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery charges already when sunlight falls on the case.
As the evening draws near, 'Smart Stone' begins to self-illuminate; in which color you choose to shine, that determines you: Six attractive light colors stand for you – in addition to Daylight White.
Eventually, shutdown will occur automatically once the battery level has dropped to a certain minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun appears, the charge cycle will begin again from the beginning on the next day.

Pillen crisis
Hello lovely womenfolk,
I hope I did everything right, it's been a year since my first post on Reddit.
My Problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I was experiencing unbearable pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
I would like to stay, because I have already taken enough medicines which I have to choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosively pickled during my last two-year pause and these everywhere.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
In the two years of pause, it never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already parfümfree and without any gedoons, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
The Frauenärztin didn't take me seriously and the Hautarzt's appointment is still coming.
Thanks to each of them who has read the novel!
The skin is so nice.
She had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then a large area of knots, and the Acne Theme.
I have tried everything related to Christian Illness and have stayed away from sugar, milk and low-saturated fat diet, because nothing else worked properly.
It could also be that Hormonell is just the worm in there, but if I want to have a look around everywhere, I'd rather not search for what else is wrong.
I had already done all of their seminar.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What would be there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But is there him generally in great?
He is available in black.

Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the receipt from the Order Number #NUMBER# to the given email address?
Can we discard the packaging material?
We have no possibilities to store these so long.
We would use the table as if it were theirs.
They had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and also received it. Therefore, because they were so beautiful, they now ordered a chair in gray.
Must the dresser be completely dismantled for the pickup and return to order?
And when would the collection be?
A new 110-kV-Earth cable will be built in 2022.
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The decision of the government of Niederbayern to approve the plan makes it possible to begin construction in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has shared it now.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the village and the existing 110-kV line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning at a pole of the overhead line.
Good Morning
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has arrived only in parts at our store.
The blue BetSendNumber#PRS_ORG# with the SendNumber#NUMBER# was returned to #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is now definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is?
Have a beautiful start to the week!
You can forget it, I already explained it to you yesterday!!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The Kommode is standing in my Wohnung and refuses to come in because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thanks for the news.
But why only 20 EUR?
The origin value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is at all books, therefore the request at #PRS_ORG# because it is likely to be a general problem.
Referencing instruction (EK)
Hello love colleagues,
I have been working in the Ref since the summer, teaching is something I enjoy, but I currently have great difficulty being time-efficient in planning my lessons in the subject of Earth Science.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well-equipped, so I can only use the board, a textbook, and an OHP as media.
In school I can only copy software for free (which makes me nauseated).
I need to plan my hours simply very long.
We are currently discussing GeoFacers and at my place it stands for itself each hour.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need it for University Bs, etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books, which my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the problems in the book I am rather unhappy.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a Earth Science teacher can help me work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have decided to get a new one from #PRS_ORG# but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
The commerce is afraid of the 2G regulation for Christmas shopping.
Most shops only allow those who have been immunized or recovered to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
He also had a ready solution.
According to the Handelsverband Germany (HDE), 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas business.
Complaints have been made about a decrease in sales of non-daily items, according to HDE-Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the respondents had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had written off their Christmas shopping.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year has now often become a hole without a floor", said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost approximately one third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's going well only in the food retail sector and the online area.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business manager.
"Shopping with 2G doesn't bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he emphasized.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required a high personnel expenditure.
He demanded that the Bändchenregelung be authorized bundeswide.
After that, each customer must be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the given band.
Furthermore, in the retail sector - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should random checks be sufficient.
Even the shopping center-specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona levels, with the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping", said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts will be made to find solutions and to obtain approval.
This includes the so-called Band-in-a-Box, where "the visitors, for example, have to present their 2G-proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that of a Club Hotel, can enter the shops without any restrictions". dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and it was delivered shortly after.
The Spiegel has a scratch and also a frame error, which was tried to be covered up with a yellow filling material.
It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it into the package and glued it.
How must I proceed for the Retour now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
One of the special features of the Controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very high light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
In addition, they are also used in reporters' situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the filmset or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows for the remote control of the light in TV studios or if the light is installed in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The user's storage has three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage places, it is simply done by pressing the longer of the storage buttons and finished.
The Speicher-Controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for operation with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the Set if the batteries have enough power - it is a Battery Tester built-in - for each of the two Battery Chargers a value in the two Display Anzeige (the left Akku upper Anzeige, the right on the lower Anzeige).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the included power supply.
The construction of the Scheinwerfer is very easy.
They have an 16mm adapter so they can attach directly to their photostand.
The tendency can be reliably adjusted on both sides using the Feststellern.
It was important that the mechanical components were extremely high quality and therefore designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a Negative Gearing is included in the Deliverable.
The delivery package also contains a nice little bag.
You can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might buy without any problems.
I gave her a gift and it was too small :(
We were going to throw a party after Frankfurt's comeback win against Leverkusen.
What a spectac # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football. Bayern Munich participated in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.FC Bayern MunichThe season began with the club winning the 2018 DFL-Supercup, defeating arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1. Bayern Munich went on to win the Bundesliga for the sixth consecutive season, finishing 11 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Werder Bremen. In the Champions League, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the round of 16 by Paris Saint-Germain. In the UEFA Super Cup, Bayern Munich defeated Sevilla 2–1 to win their third consecutive title.## Players### First-team squadAs of
After 22 minutes, it seemed that the recently defeated twice in a row Hessen were on their way to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned around, shot itself within a good hour of frustration over a mediocre season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's insanity, what the boys have done today", yelled coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "Praise, to each and every one of them", out.
Initially, it looked like a dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What happened then impressed even the SGE Trainer.
"How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance", as Glasner continued.
I am insane happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who had been on the field for the first time since the fourth game and had overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible", said the 27-year-old and was delighted with a glance at the result, particularly for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to shoot.
Glasner will now keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself in a good position regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we have all the players in top shape in December, that all the players are physically in a top formation.
It is top-quality work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wanted to "step by step" continue and remain modest, and to complete the tasks until the end of the year "on this level".
Next up is already on Wednesday a away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (8:30 pm, Sky).
I am returning the package to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect, with no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order has to be cancelled again?
Then it would be a shame for me to order again because it has already taken very long.
Have they ever sat on the PRS_ORG chairs?
Damper for Handball women before Quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's Handball women slunk away after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty gazes from the court.
The DHB selection's poor performance in the World Cup main round ended with a 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers. They now have to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must approach Spain differently.
After losing their first match in the tournament, Germany finished Group III with 8 wins and 2 losses, finishing second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game that we have to delete, said Captain Emily Bölk.
To keep the dream alive of winning a first medal since 2007, a significant improvement is needed in the fight for the quarterfinals against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following day.
Germany's best female thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense", said midfielder Xenia Smits and urged: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not on the same level from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the kickoff.
Mistakes in the attack and defensive lapses were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on Standard Temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB Team scored the first goal after 9 minutes and 30 seconds, as Grijseels finished a quick counterattack successfully.
The expected initial spark was not this, however.
German women were unable to effectively counter the aggressive defense of the Danish players - and when they did manage to get into the game, they often fell victim to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Skandinavian team's goal.
The game ended at 3:10 after 20 minutes, as Mia Zschocke received a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals she can participate again.
In the final phase of the first half, the DHB-selection started to play better and was at least within five goals of the opponent.
The already faint hope for a comeback in the 9:19 was already gone after seven minutes.
The Groener's Shooters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for the medals at the Endgame.
In the following, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and exited the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Time

How was it then at home?
How is your\*partner\*in?
Would you like to pass on your traditions to your kids?
What is the best thing for the children?
What is Stiefelputzen?
Cookie baking?
Is tree pruning?
Will they be playing music?
Is the Weihnachtsmann, the Christkind, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone puts in the effort and goes the extra mile around Christmas to make it as beautiful as possible as a family.
Whether it is now firm traditions or even something else: tell us how it is in your family!
Could you please send me any Transaction Number... or else, what could help.

Does it go well with them?
The title is known, I am active as an impfzt in mobile impfteams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer impfstoff is being implied in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be finished in part, it goes on to Impf centers for me.
I answer questions without time limit to the organizational and human aspects, and medical questions, so long as these are not personal (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does it go with the vaccination...").
My responsibilities include providing education about the vaccine, determining the indication (person has the right to be vaccinated according to the Corona vaccination guidelines and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation, and emergency treatment in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The immunization itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical technicians.
In pharmaceutical teams we often do not have any pharmaceutical-technical assistants, but only "just" (please, no lack of respect!) immunizations for the vaccine preparation, which can not be done (allowed?), so I had to do most of the immunizations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger knows the solution.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This Bavarian dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused heated contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unfamiliar to the callers this time.
No, it was not a "Man, who is nervous".
And also none, "everything must go quickly".
People heard from the TV Moderatorin that it was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused much astonishment among many Oberpfälzers.
The Hoodler, the audience learned, is a lap that someone uses to wipe the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed it.
With the remark that this is a typical Oberpfalzian concept, derived somehow from the more widely known Mundart word "Houden".
How a educational gap was closed - even for many who had been living in the area of Amberg for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for the last two weeks.
After confirmation, it always follows an error message: Oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have started the #PRS_ORG#, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Are Reifenwahlen really so puncture-proof for a racing bike?
I woke up this morning full of energy to start preparing for my bike tour in the next week, at least to do a little training.
I said, I did it and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then it happened, what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glasspitter on the track.
Zack, loud squeak and my rear wheel didn't want to participate any more.
Since I couldn't get a real replacement mantle and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with half-hearted enthusiasm and turn around and go home again.
It wasn't quite so bad technically, perhaps it's better to practice the Reifenchange before the ride.
Now I am standing before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would not enjoy having this problem often.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had given me the bike until 2 pm and had driven 120 km with them) were also suboptimal, since he had driven them for many years.
When I think about having to do a tire change after driving 80-90km, I'm really grumpy :D
Now I was talking to an older man at the Bahnsteig, who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplatable.
It sounds natural very attractive.
Are these really unknappable?
I don't have much enthusiasm to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed later.
I'm still asking myself: I think I'm on the Rennrad 25 times 622.
There is also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend another brand of tires for my Rennrad?
The Schwalbe's page seems to be absolute! Do you recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and love greetings!

However, this design includes a foot that is perfectly suited for the job, to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the given circumstances.
The Solo 15 is very suitable for persons for whom the maximum volume is of secondary importance, but an exceptionally high sound quality is desired.
A 10 cm speaker is not able to generate nearly unfiltered high sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weakly.
Contrary to this, she stepped impressively grown and extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone increase.
This is generally done to optimize the strongly increasing bundling at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 delivers an exact sound placement with a clear and fine sound.
The high-tone area can be reduced and the sound image made warmer by turning it slightly outward.
Thanks to the Puncture sound source, the location of each component of a musical piece is accur # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football.

The suspicious low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM generate an enemy dynamics that seeks its own kind.
The SOLO 15 not only adds to our SOLO Series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to consider the final optical appearance of the speaker at the beginning of the build, in order to plan appropriate changes accordingly.
If one wants to, for example, furnish the casing, the sinking of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furniture adds more material.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the Baumarkt), first an 8 mm hole should be drilled into the floor plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to easily run the cable through it later.
With the help of an Oberfräse, the speaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed later in a smooth manner.
This opening should be fitted with a 45° phase in order to maximize the interior opening of the speaker chassis.
The four screw connection points of B 100 - 6 OHM will receive a break in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of them.
These will now be covered with the rear wall, the top, the front, and the floor.
Here, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The reinforcements can be varied in the material strength if necessary, for example, by using prefabricated frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot, both sides, and the front.
Using a suitable loching saw or forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex pipe, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall will be facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a Roundfraser to round off all the edges of the actual box.
Even the upper side of the floor plate can be rounded with it.
After that, the footplate is glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the connection points of the speaker chassis and the anchors clamp.
After the casing was cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the back wall.
During this process, the entire uncut cable is fed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and is allowed to hang out approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there.
Following, the Frequency Switch will be prepared and used.
The frequency switch's construction plan, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation Guide Solo 15.
If the frequency switch has been installed and the terminal connection has been secured, then the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box should be completed, which has not yet been completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and thus close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the insulation accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with appropriate screws.
The polarity is important, so that the Plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the Plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the Bassreflex rod will be cut to the specified length of 28 mm (Total length of the rod) and inserted.
To dampen the vibrations, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bassreflexkanal should be kept free.
Can I cancel a order now and deliver it in June?
Hello to all
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
We are sorry but it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio due to the higher planning effort and the short notice of the announcement.
However: There will be at least three people there, so we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
However, it is still pandemic – nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start about 0:30.
Set yourself up some chill drinks, plan a good meal, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
