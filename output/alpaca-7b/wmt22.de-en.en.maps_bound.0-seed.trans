The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the item's value....
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and thus it is no problem for me.
I need only a number or instruction to attach the package so that it can be tracked as a return to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs her 179€.
I find it really irritating.
Should I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price or is there another way of getting a refund?
I think it is generally not right to expect children to take on a parental role for their siblings.
Nevertheless, I think it is also good for big siblings to help out with the little ones in moderation.
Look quickly, help quickly, bring the bottle etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
When your K1 is occupied with something for a short time by themselves and it's okay with them, that's alright.
You can best assess whether it fits for your children.
It is not so that he should have to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while dozing off.
It is probably questionable legally.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
If something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether it is a risk that you want to take is of course your own decision ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer...
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by stuffing himself with food and going into the enclosure with his pet cats.
The case is taken over by a commissar who, after a short investigation, goes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissar has a small niece who is afraid of fire and will be sent to this therapist.
There will be more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center and the patients ultimately face their fears to the extreme.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death.)
This feeling of fear will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there was a great showdown in the clinic which had caught on fire.
That is the rough plot I am sure the book was written by a French author / authoress in the original.
If this action is known to someone or if someone even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN.
I have to contact my husband first.
That could take some time.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years, Splinter under the Thumbnail.
Child, 4 years, has splinters of wood under the thumb nail (outside).
They tried to pull him with a pinch.
Very difficult to grasp.
It did not work out and caused pain.
When we try it, the child reacts hysterically.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow, it's off to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson will push for a booster shot.
Politics and science in Great Britain are constantly dealing with new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive the vaccine by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to progress faster with the Corona vaccine booster shots in light of the rapidly rising Omega numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that three months have passed since their second vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
The target date was originally set for the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to ensure the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are accelerated.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation due to the Omikron variant, so we need to strengthen our vaccination protection immediately.
The good news is that the protection level can be raised again with a third vaccination.
"Let's get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of the Omikron virus were registered in Great Britain, thus increasing the total number to 3137.
In comparison to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone using pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today, an invitation to a conversation was sent by mail.
I will reply to the email.
Unfortunately, his name is not "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I have googled him/her and depending on where they have a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the email.
Can someone help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to even step on a police officer's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books in total.
4 of them are going.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
It was obvious that the chair had a hidden defect when it was sold.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
We first tried it on the #PRS_ORG#.
It has been working since approximately.
14 days not anymore.
Therefore, I always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 more.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and have the bill sent to me.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I have to write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence due to my profession.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims are not able to help themselves or think that we cannot help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in conversation with the perpetrator in private, with them far beyond the scope of vision and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will get better but it will never be easy.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
What does the Netflix series "Arcane" have to do with "League of Legends"?
There is plenty of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing visual style: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick was visited by the police.
Nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said that the team still had something of a grudge against their Pokal defeat in October, when they faced Hakro Merlins Crailsheim.
She then didn't lay down - but instead further increased her performance despite the 61:72 (28:38) - loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the bare result was disappointing.
As an example, a statistic is cited that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple-header rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick answered: "We were not concentrated enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and we did not implement what we had trained for."
Moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "What a great game to win again against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 people were allowed to attend the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they still had to pay for it.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best game manager I ever trained", praised Gleim still.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the entire line.
In the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and came within eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
Besides Patrick Johannes, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
The Riesen will already be hosting the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:19 PM), before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of 750 spectators.
We had an earlier email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have therefore re-written to them.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always called: Max Raabe will be 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with fresh interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is traveling with the program "Good Day, Lucky Star" - if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig.
Nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "due to governmental instructions" in order to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances of his in the Advent season have had to be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 today, and his orchestra (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then be able to make up for the concerts they had to postpone due to the Corona pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing and playing music since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is impossible to ignore from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good Morning, Love Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the color scheme.
It still doesn't work, I can only long for the cover page but not to turn the page.
Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz: Through Enteignment, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister for Construction and Urban Development Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as it has been demanded in the Berlin referendum.
"With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
When the situation did not calm down, Geywitz was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent freeze until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in overheated housing markets and the expansion of the rent ceiling.
I will be speaking with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again?
Will it ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Discount sounds great.
Then I would uncheck it at the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
When the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipment take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 people were killed by tornados in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has swept through the USA, causing numerous tornadoes.
It is feared that more than 100 people could have died in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several Tornados have caused severe destruction in the USA and may have claimed up to hundred lives.
The storms leave a path of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, "Everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone."
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this could be possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the vitrine #NAME# has sold out.
That is very sad.
Is it still produced?
Is she completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you have to sign in?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I please order the lid and have it shipped to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned the contact form and was wondering if it had arrived or been processed, since I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay for vaccines and change their advertising slogans.
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money rewards for getting vaccinated.
By doing so, they are on the same page as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
Even the transformation of advertising slogans into "Stay safe - get vaccinated" - in the German style - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched to a new firm about which he has complained.
It does not make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year since.
He had obviously not been tied to his old position and had been looking for something else.
You can also do it.
And that he didn't like you then: no big deal.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the reservation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I am finishing a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Wow!
I am currently leading an adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual characters created and I am now writing the initial adventure and stumbling already during the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There they should unfold the further events.
The hero should be lured into a trap by a group of goblins that are some miles away from the village.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, acting, threatening, detecting the danger early on, whatever comes up.
Group size: 8 normal goblins, 2 with arrows, 6 with bows and swords equipped.
Unaware of their presence, the Goblins lurk in the Holloway waiting to ambush the Heroes with three archers on either side, while two more stand in their way with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes were all rendered unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights intervenes and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is the Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much for a first adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas and now I also have more trust in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back.
Can you then come back with the receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space?
I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1.
Hello lovely F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been steadily declining over the season, so I thought I'd take a break with this post.
First, the transmission was interrupted midway through the F2 race in order to begin the F1 pre-race coverage punctually.
Although the delayed start and the crash had caused the time plan to be far behind the original plan, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It appears that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky Germany had no choice.
Despite being dumb, Sky UK has decided to end the race prematurely.
Despite that, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a great job commentating on the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was yet another rules misunderstanding by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they didn't know that one has to change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was not until Hamilton received the corresponding radio messages that Verstappen was allowed to change his tires.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I believe one should be familiar with such basic rules if one is commentating on a Pay-TV F1 channel.
It is not the first time a puzzle-solving game has been played, which now follows the rules or requires it, both of which have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, Roos doesn't like the artificial style of commenting, but it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition to constant foolishness, which both appear to be unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee with the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one is causing a lot of commotion in the comments, which he clearly doesn't take seriously.
Not least, advertising has taken over completely at Sky, in the last round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, so one can only listen to the German audio without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF is doing it.
These two channels do less advertising than Sky, and they are free-TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, it does not erase the drawbacks.
The rest of the programming on Sky Sports F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts the F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races they still have to broadcast, even without the commercials.
Therefore, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it could with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the #PRS_ORG# Pendelleuchte, Metal and multi-colored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice but so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send the email and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already displayed a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I need your help.
Air pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate an air filtration system using an air pump.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can compare the services there.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire facilities can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, you should get pumps with two or more outlets, so that you can connect multiple water circulators.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, an air pump can be used to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decoration, which transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to name.
The MK-Series has a special soundproof construction, resulting in low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The fan motor is connected to the air duct via a 4/6 mm hose...and it's ready to go.
The fan should be level, or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the water level is lower than the pump, a back-pressure valve should be installed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the ventilator between the two ends.
This would prevent it from happening if water were to run backwards through the pump, draining the basin...
If the fan should be installed outdoors, it should be, like other air pumps, covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK Series are pure power packages, consuming little energy.
Even though we have indicated a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, the items are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to take precautions so that nobody gets upset, just because it took a bit longer than usual.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for the employees who also work in the logistics...of course, here the Corona virus has nothing to do with it.
Please don't rate us poorly just because the delivery was delayed, it's the fault of the delivery services.
People like to complain about these services, even though we are saying...they have it really hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Be kind to no one, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times ahead.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrest?
Could one also order the legs here in white?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is sending his daughter, an astronaut, and a moderator into space.
The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator, and four additional passengers have taken a short space trip.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally received the recently selected astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, wearing a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers slowly climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space flight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin didn't share how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator said he would love to go back to space again.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness, before it was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no universally accepted international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting and engaging in the lab.
I had already inform myself about the job prospects before studying, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely keep studying until the PhD.
I am currently dealing with doubts, especially concerning the job prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) one always hears about amazing job opportunities and the profession is highly sought after, on the other side one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
That would really interest me:
What are you working on right now?
Are you satisfied with your work/pay?
What have you studied/ What kind of education have you had?
Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering whether to terminate my studies and pursue an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have experiences, write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Holiday & Weekend Days
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore, it is now necessary to set a post.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
It appears that there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was thus: Last week was Mary's Ascension, which is called "Ascension Day" in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses take a semi-official day off on Fridays.
Last weekend, there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of emails, that had to be done immediately before departure, task here, task there, everything *had* to be done before the long weekend.
Why... why?
Why does it sound like it's taking so much time?
Why do people want to accomplish so much in a short week as if it were a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is the reason for this self-imprisonment due to holidays?
Why do we still need holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above; the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know it in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is excited about Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has yet to receive any presents.
Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one can still go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will join in the celebration by baking cookies and decorating them with her son.
"I love it", said Catterfeld.
Until the thoughtful days, she still had a few things to do: "For the first time, I still had no gifts, I had to finally finish up."
NEKTON-Bio helps ensure a smooth moulting and feather renewal process.
Nekton-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio awards the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the feather damage that occurs in bird aviculture is due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are composed of protein-rich substances, a properly balanced and adequate protein diet is essential for the formation of a perfect, flawless feather coat.
Your daily diet should contain adequate vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in order to ensure a functioning metabolism.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during the moulting season are due to inadequate or uneven protein intake and/or deficiencies in vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While taking NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
Nekton-Bio is cold-water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or feed.
Thank you, I found it.
It still doesn't work.
This is a DDR Handwork Model E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was in use in East Germany and Central Germany. It is very rare, and likely comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railroader magazine, issue 11/1968. It has been used and has some play and missing parts, but it is in good condition. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the schlesische network. It is possible that the kit also comes from the small-scale manufacturer Zschütschke and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being restored for operation.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to propose an electric locomotive that could haul 2.200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was required to be 65 km/h.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to procure a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered with the numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and eventually found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
It was determined at the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau that all six locomotives were fit for overhaul.
[4] As the need for electric locomotives for heavy freight transport increased with the progress of electrification in the mid-German network, three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the available E 04, E 44, and E 94 were preferred for construction in larger quantities.
When it became clear that the number of repairs on the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They arrived at the railway workshop Halle P. in 1960.
They were usually stationed in a separate loop plan and sent off before coal trains from the Geiseltal Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives became problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that Schütze got stuck while performing health checks.
Then the Beimann who always had to travel with the locomotive had to unlock the shutter during the journey, using a hammer and a wooden wedge.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and caused months-long failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new build locomotives available and no plans for a significant expansion of the electric operations. Therefore, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter gattungen, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to only staff their electric locomotives with a single engineer, which would have caused problems due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the poor visibility from the cab.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, with the E 95 01 following suit and quitting the service on October 5th, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives, except for E95 02, were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it in a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
She had belonged since then to the Transportation Museum in Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) is taking care of the locomotive in a museum-like way.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, with the transformers checked and five motors found to be operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their reliable engine and minimal maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to join the mid-German networks.
The main deployment area was initially Silesia.
This is a handmade H0 model in OVP, it works well, it needs optical repairs to the loco done by the owner, it is dusty, with play tracks, and a musty smell!!!, this is a very rare handmade model, it may have come from the small-run company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is being held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle balken is held by two feet, these are unfortunately defective.
The middle beam doesn't fit into the intended bracket.
I also get new ones.
When will they be sent?
No, not flat.
According to the Montage Instructions, the correct ones were too narrow.
But that's okay.
Mainly they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat for me.
Could I please get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a substantial damage has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
According to police reports, two people were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not believe it was a deliberate act.
The police department in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
She eventually arrives, but much later.
I still have to pay shipping costs.
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur then shared a photo of himself showing his Corona vaccination.
His friend's illness prompted him to share, according to Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him getting a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the "LinkedIn" network.
"Since some months my friends have been pushing me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors".
So far he has rejected it, because the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a breathing machine for three weeks.
His schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He didn't ask after the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust.
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle has been circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," said Şahin then.
There is a priority for vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been long since lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in Transformer Station: Ten Thousand People Without Power
In several towns in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases, also no heating.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electricity substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhineland-Palatinate had to go without power for 24 hours.
Thousands of people had their lights go out on Friday evening due to a fire that affected 41,000 people in several communities.
Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power sources had been in operation on Saturday until the widespread disturbance was finally completely resolved by the end of the night.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered places of refuge in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their effort.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their untiring effort, stated Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technologies, in a statement Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would take several days, as the Westnetz-monteurs had to first put some lines back in operation provisionally.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company statements.
Electricity is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are expensive cleaning and repair works needed.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt power level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday at 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power back.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on at 21.30.
Since 11:55 PM, even the last ones still affected by the power outage had electricity.
Over 80 workers from Westnetz and its partner firms had been deployed.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or isolated people and inform the local fire station when help is needed, as explained by Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power sources, the residents of nursing homes were the main focus.
In addition, temporary care centers were set up in schools for those people who couldn't take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment, according to authorities.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euro?
It is about the day sky #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the understructure on the tabletop.
It is about a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 implementations of it.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, however I cannot squeeze it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return them, since they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be glad to receive a response.
That is really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried it before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find it almost unbelievable that the discount is so low.
We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins.
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
They had to surrender to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already built up a huge lead after the ski jumping.
Return the Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
We both have installed the new version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem before.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be there.
I want to open it, comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
They should report the file as possibly being corrupted to the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now what?
I have to work in between!
In order to ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should wash the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry thoroughly.
Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the later not visible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
A light overlap of the color layers ensures a even surface later.
Avoid quick, back and forth wiping with the brush.
This leads to unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors are finished off with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal flakes when they are mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you sand them.
The models obtain their original look through the decals or stickers.
From airplane insignia to ship names to model decorations and identification marks on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order, as long as the parts are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be/easily fitted before it is inserted into the body.
More important than the right tool such as a knife, scissors and tweezers are when gluing patience, time and a steady hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and lay it down for you.
Decals are also known as water-sliding pictures, because you can make their back side wet by quickly pouring water on it until the paper backing becomes dark.
Then you just peel off the picture from the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also pre-moistened).
While you are holding the decal in place with a tool, you are gently pulling the transfer paper away from the model.
Attention: Always check to make sure the picture is securely in place before you completely remove it from the paper, to prevent it from sticking to your finger, knitting, or tearing.
You can absorb excess water with a household rag.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book for a few seconds as soon as I look away, then I can't read it and have to log out and log back in and search for the place I was reading from.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this per email?
Is it for all 3 packages?
For the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me.
Thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back easily?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in infertility treatment for a while, but now that it's time to deal with the Statutory Health Insurance, it suddenly puts up a fight.
In order:
We had applied for the IVF cycle in advance and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was thus reimbursed by the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the PKV yet.
We applied again for cost sharing with the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had done more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we handed in the bills at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first offer are lost.
The second child wish should be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right to pay for the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the contract that a birth would have rendered the further attempts futile?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (resulting from blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you already for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Everything is in order.
We will not be ordering anything from them anymore.
When they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass it on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague said to me that the repayment was initiated and now they are saying that I have to first send the thing back.
I can't do anything about it if the chest of drawers shows up completely destroyed at my place.
Please take a look at the screenshot to see what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the repayment was triggered and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two loyal customers.
My friend has also ordered diverse furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect appeared only after a few months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal usage.
They are not allowed to sell it as a office chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty lasts 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will take the schrank apart and make it available to the transportation company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are being advertised with additional purchase incentives, which we unfortunately cannot find at your location.
Can they help?
The topic of the week: The best low budget films
A low-budget film is not easily defined, as there are no exact budget limits that apply to all films.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of lists of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What bothers you about it?
What do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will then give up soon, as it is simply not working here.
Hello
A half-victory against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU.
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs were however high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, as the researcher of the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) explained.
This tug-of-war situation - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The way the people at the border are treated is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong.
It appears that there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by certain EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not take a firm stance against it, it will come at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens simultaneously the unity in the Union.
She apparently cannot get her way when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is the case with Poland, which has not even allowed Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a price for its policy on the border with Belarus, as Bossong explains: A consensus on the Asylum policy will be harder to achieve, since the line "Border control, border control, border control" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again.
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to illegally enter Poland from Belarus.
55 migrants were apprehended in the night of Saturday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officers were attacked with stones near Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
The border police registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
By Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had already breached the border fences.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, of luring them with the promise of visa-free travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines for bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent their departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and proven its resolve to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared to accept that the security apparatus regularly herds thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting the controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suggest two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is being made against Max Verstappen's alleged breach of the rules at Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes's view, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had come away with his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was performed shortly after the conclusion of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had passed the car ahead of him.
I am checking it.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the support.

The roller coaster cars were illuminated that day by the red and white T-shirts.
Foxes, Euromaus figures and numerous red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop", as the park described it.
Since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a collaboration between the Bundesligist and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag event in the Europa-Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Watching shining fans having fun in the roller coaster, confirms what Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack says: "It's great to see people having fun together."
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not €1699?

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That is like when an AfD supporter says he has nothing against foreigners.
You will have to give it up to both of them.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of antisemitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, then one should just leave it completely.
Yeah, you're about as serious as Kollegah.
Whoever seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply lost.
God has brought the whole thing into motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And thus you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal vision field, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the Lupe practically error- and color-free even in the edge area.
Loupes are often marked with magnification ratings.
These conditions only apply to exact specifications that are rarely the same as the general usage conditions.
In order to use your Lupe optimally, please take into consideration the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (See User Manual in the package).
Light reflections also appear on the lenses of all optical devices - even when there is a light strike.
Through a antireflective coating, these reflections can be significantly reduced.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - a magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English languages).

Hello lovely #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already registered with you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it said before.
They cannot deliver from England due to the #PRS_ORG#.
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even had to return home without his partner, because they couldn't agree.
He plants there about 2000 trees every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says the Christmas season always makes things a bit more cheerful.
What about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'll be a customer elsewhere!
Although I received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price for it, I am still satisfied.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from delicious.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly, receiving and sending 50 Mbit without any issues.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these speeds.
However, the other DLan Modul, which is sending out the WiFi, is not sending out the full 500 anymore, but the further I get away from it in the house, the less it sends out (using a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other Modul).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which appears to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Could someone explain why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to install LAN cables in that house.
I am really at the point of despair, so I created this extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted to receive an answer.
When is it time to switch the Giro account?
Who would have thought it would be peaceful with the Giro accounts, they were deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases, negative interest rates have further eroded customers' deposit protection.
The Deutsche Bank, for instance, was long considered generous with a limit of 100,000 Euro.
She has just halved her monthly allowance and even quartered her daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily accounts.
However, these lowered freebies are now applicable to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 Euros, which is still in effect, as well as for the ING Germany.
The recently popular among cost-conscious customers Direct Bank DKB has reduced the bonus amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 Euros, and now to 25,000 Euros.
Despite this: More than 100 banks have according to the Internet portal Verivox already a free bonus of 25,000 Euro or less.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 Euros: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there between the consumer centers, which won the first instance court case against this regulation in Berlin.
Now banks are discussing whether they should set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and have to repay millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty team.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Your life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, 2021 was the year of the "Friends" revival and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show". This success is primarily due to their discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers are dedicated to perfecting their appearance.
At least, as Aniston says, she allows herself a chip every day (yes, that's right: a single chip from the bag).
That you were able to capture the hearts of both female and male fans at the same time is really remarkable.
Maybe because she has bad luck with the good things - and still searching for the great love.
And he removed the baby wish from the list.
Before she was always asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked had no idea what was going on with me personally, medically, why I couldn't.
It was really hurtful.
Hope remains that even success and fame will bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light tire rub, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also gone to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and was on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I have calculated that I need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he initially fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, by moving up from third place.
Then he changed something in the material settings and raced on Sunday with 0.30 seconds of lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was third.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also notched his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, came in second this time around, placing fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the two-person bob on her home track.
After coming in fourth the day before, she raced with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to a World Cup victory on Sunday.
Mariama Jamanka, the two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion from BRC Thüringen, came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked her Olympic qualification as well as her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is going with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It is not only about pushing, but there is also a lot of work to be done around it".
Jamanka was a bit frustrated by the not entirely error-free runs, but she said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the Decke in my shopping cart and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't cash it in, so I finally had to ask.
Due to Corona, I had different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired which made me very angry.
They were discussing the Asare Chair in the chat.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is reduced :)
Why is the shipping not starting until 16.3?
There was nothing on your website about such long delivery times.
No, only when I press the button does an extra field with the message appear.
Your colleague took it away yesterday.
Why is it today a problem?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
However, we would still like to buy the dresser module, even a new unscathed one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello beautiful girls and women,
I have something I want to write and maybe it will help the one - or the other...
I am 24, have a part-time job, am a student and a dogmama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to the kindergarten, he is pretty much 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, he has got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressive (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand was in a bandage due to burns).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week), which is bothering me a lot with regards to my needs for affection and love.
My dog is feeling sick, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I warmed the heating pad and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now comes the fun part - housework - that we have to divide up amongst us.
But cooking is a lot of work for me...
My Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is currently in a good place, I am halfway through therapy and am managing okay.
Not good, but I'm managing okay and almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything, and on Saturday I have an Anatomy class, for which I should at least prepare something.
Next week I have a written exam on Tuesday, and then whatever comes up is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room for it.
My week is going like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on further?
Only until birthday.
Only until the vacation beginning.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors to prevent me from going crazy.
I feel somehow guilty and "chaotic", but I can't seem to do it any other way...
Does it also go for you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly endlessy thankful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think it has something to do with the mental load that women often carry and that's why I thought I could find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today unfortunately it is the other color plus the surface is scratched and the table top has a print.
The first delivery was exactly the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
When we are going to change the table, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In other words, twice.
She was not confirmed.
Nothing was the same: I noticed in school then that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you stand it?
You could also tell stories about your colleagues from work and school with different attitudes.
I understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the relativity theory.
Why would someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I would like to write in English as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would have to abandon it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help please with movie search.
Hello lovely people,
I am searching for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, he saw a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in the Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who is trying to bring the woman there so he can live.
I believe the crossing is also the soldier's grave.
I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other in the end.
If it says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our Little One has only slept on her stomach since Week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, go take a look, but don't watch too long, but keep an eye on everything.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ah so and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly?
Is it lying face first directly in the mattress?
You can draw from this to determine whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was a big change and a joy to be able to put the kids on their bellies to sleep.
In addition, we are already "loyal customers" to you and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20 Euro?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response.
It's about my wardrobe which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the dresser.
I would please you to contact me quickly.
The chest is not currently available for use.
To make it completely clear.
RBTV promised much.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I had fun with RBTV as well.
It's simply that the politics of this sender have gone to the dogs.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: He wanted to be "no running advertisement column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising sender, who tries to sell his BillMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
This applies to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They can obviously continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and is trying to take advantage of the situation with the exploded rented rooms to make ash.
How should one find all of this good?
Great when it suits you, I find it awful.
I would like to return the defective wooden table that was delivered to me.
A corpus break has been caused by the damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling – my small warm friend is versatilely usable.

Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) could not be charged anymore through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power supply would be enough to operate the device.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with an inserted power cord.
Afterwards, I took the battery out, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in a network connection?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to receive the #PRS_ORG# delivery to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is.....
Are you often on tour but still carrying a lot of gear?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
This 20-liter capacity can swallow even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored with the padded FlexFold-Teiler.
And whatever else you need for everyday items is well organized and detachable from the photo equipment in the customizable interior compartment.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalistic design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that ensure the interior of the backpack and yet grant access to the photo equipment in a matter of seconds.
It works with two options: Either conventionally through the lid, which is secured with the MagLatch system, or with an excellent thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with messenger bags.
Inside the closure is a metal latch with matching brackets on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most other backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “fill levels”: there are four anchor points, sturdily riveted, to which the latch can be attached.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, you take a lower one.
The latches and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photorucksacks fundamentally: Besides the flap closure, there is still a zippered opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with a top-opening access - you don't have to rummage through the contents anymore!
This clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you, for example, are not only carrying your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
With the Everyday Backpack you can customize the interior (more details below) and thus easily separate both items without any problems - and through the two side openings also access them independently.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday items stay securely in the left backpack pocket and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
The #NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the
Spedition has announced an attempt to contact the customer to arrange the return of the wrongly delivered table.
Up to now I have not received any message.
I would like immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support staff member, with none of them did I get further than the promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is then to be seen when the chest could be delivered again?
Letting him go is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for your help.
I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will immediately place a larger order, but I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected was not something I could anticipate and I was unable to address and clarify it in a timely manner.
However, I have accepted the damage as a customer and this I will not accept.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered shining pieces of gold in the water at the southern branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing towns in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, who is seeking wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the nearby rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must exceed your pioneer colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategic game with many paths to victory.
You must simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that eventually works for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to obtain additional actions, or to adjust the rules in your favor.
By using these buildings and the dynamic bridge pieces, you can customize your gameplay with finer adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it receives a ban!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players will take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The Spinner rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on forever until the Announcer has moved five times, thus completely covering all locations and the year ends.
There is a shootout taking place, in which the players Coloma have to defend themselves against an attack by the angry bandits.
When the players have contributed enough Revolvermen and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Usually I am insured with DPD and I can track my shipments (sometimes they come with game pieces, wrapped in tissue paper and packed with bubble wrap).
If you are a collector, then I can send the item in a cardboard box for an extra charge of 2 Euros, so that it will not go to any printing presses.
Why Children Are Not Tyrannical. Documentary, ARD Mediathek.
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Will Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now leveling serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never try to gain power over the child.
Our aim must always be to provide the child with space for their development and to set the boundaries as large as possible in a way that is sensible and feasible.
It's still shaking me.
Holetschek: States are discussing the loss of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on their next meeting about the abolishment of the threefold testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated.
We need clarity as soon as possible whether and when thrice vaccinated people can be exempt from the testing obligation, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus for vaccination", said Holetschek.
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) promised to present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the next day. - afp
I will also please send the lamp back.
How should I go there?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can't process any more purchases through my #PRS_ORG.
Advertisement: Oops, there has been an error.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe will be referred to as *Awareness*, which is sensory perceptions under conscious sedation.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is the most common occurrence, followed by seeing images and feeling pain the least.
This topic is relevant: C-sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as one must protect the child until the umbilical cord is completely cut off.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex had** no awareness **per definition.**
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if they can at least take back the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose some money.
I sent you an email which you did not answer.
Could you please repeat the question?
The order and invoice specify that the item should be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, since I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an impresario.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book lying on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The diary of a slow and painful farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading the news arrived that the author had died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common types of pallets are European pallets, which are standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million Euros.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually, is not raised.

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received here last week many great tips for the perfect goulash.
There was an abundance of it for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have become accustomed to the taste and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
I will set up a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going?
What happened to the books or how can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'm still learning.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed via mail on 18.01. that the refund had been processed.
But to this day, my money has not been used.
Would you please check it?
Where Christmas ham is still available in Lübeck.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have they not yet bought any chicken?
Time is running out.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the heat and fat of the guitar amplifier's sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controls you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
The amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, allowing you to reduce the sound level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion.
It already sounded like it was possible to activate a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, if it ever got too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, the entire potential of the VT+ Series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even with headphones or direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX input, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate sound device.
If you purchase the VFS5 foot pedal, you can access the sounds by tapping your foot, adjust the effects blocks on/off and control the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essentially required for live deployment.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
He had seen it at other places.
Is there any possibility to send the lamp back?
Does it hang too low for a dining table?
I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update regarding the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a refund or a coupon.
If necessary, I will find a buyer for the furniture.
If the item cost more than 1000 Euros, then it is definitely something I don't need.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hinge.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded.
Do you offer a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over the Nuclear Agreement.
At the negotiations over the revival of the international atomic agreement, Iranian officials reported progress.
"Both sides are standing on the verge of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday as reported by the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", since there was even no agreement at the beginning about the topics to be discussed.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building atomic weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a week of interruption.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now the German federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen is the only German state that has exceeded the 1000 mark for Corona infections on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new cases of infection per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in the country, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but it was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, there were 2242 new cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths due to infection within a day.
200 people suffering from Covid-19 were treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I understand it.
Since the delivery is scheduled to begin in March, it might still be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the package and send it with the post, right?
Do I have to click/select/fill anything else here?
That is what I want to avoid, so I am writing to you.
I would like to pay for the return to sender.
8 euro return postage fee is in my opinion a dishonesty.
It is time for changes.
The Bundestag has greeted me, I am/StratorDE in the Plenarsaal in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post here for?
When one looks at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one can observe that it is not existent.
We have gotten into a wintertime standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
What happened?
Most likely it is simply a matter of being unhappy with how certain things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many are still really excited about the Bundestag.
What we need to change.
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking which one wants to keep it alive.
The spark was ignited by u/edizVEVO, who had become aware of this project in the last days and simply found a pile of shattered fragments.
After some back-and-forth writing, a few people from the community found each other and decided to revive the project.
However, I would also like to call upon everyone once more to participate, so that this project can have a future existence.
We have created a Discussion platform in the form of a Discord server to exchange ideas and work on concrete tasks.
You can join the server by following this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten a few things, but it's not too bad, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different hanging for you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Is the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# also available in large sizes, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be picked up soon.
And I beg you to do it now.
I haven't found a suitable packaging, but I'll try to take the shelf apart as far as possible for the pickup - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by telephone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for the installation?
How long would I have time to obtain these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live vegetarian for a while, but now eats meat only occasionally.
I was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I had thought that by being a vegetarian I would be supporting the animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that there was a hint of displeasure on their side, but she defended the vegetarian lifestyle and said she knew where her meat came from and how vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "plump".
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without wanting to.
A vegan-loving harmony-seeking person greets you.
It is not an exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not there on the assigned date to pick up my reports from #PRS_ORG.
Since I cannot be there due to a funeral, it cannot be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup time.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards, I will be available continuously.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 Euros for a new rescue vehicle for the Voluntary Fire Department of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 Euro.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this endeavor", says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment truck is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks both above and below water in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they have come to expect increasing numbers of visitors: The boom of the hotel ship industry on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the continuously growing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, have contributed to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations however synchronized, removed and reloaded the App nothing worked.
I am a bit frustrated since it took so much time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks first and foremost for taking the time to get involved in this, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar capacity, meaning we were both bodyguards in the executive, furthermore I do not wish to go into detail!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistically.
Generally, one should say that the state employee is more likely to come from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, people on the right of the political spectrum are attracted to uniforms and weapons carriers, as well as anyone who is clear that these people can not cope with the realities of life. This is also clear, because you have now in addition to the average white, many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I mean not the overly feminine stereotypical gay, but rather normal men and women who do not make it obvious when they tell them). And I can rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or set this for you.
Although even these marginalized groups represent, at first it may seem comical, my experience shows a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel alienated by overly-liberal policies, even if these policies seem to be intended for them or to right their wrongs, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the Right, since of course police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, which however openly express their opinion there or even openly plan state-threatening plans, which is overly exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have been in the foreign service to begin to generalize due to negative experiences and to say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right-minded people will meet who enjoy a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it will be successfully combatted and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply entrenched in international affairs and that is also good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered from the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not sold out.
I had already placed my order in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that's not deliverable anymore.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany or it is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only Sie as partner firm.
However, above the edge of the wooden part are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Is the child orderly?
Hello, I've been working on this for quite some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with little free time), but for my entire life I have had more difficulty than success in keeping my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which nothing gets done, and then suddenly I am overwhelmed and I clean and organize.
However, it is actually never the case that someone would spontaneously come to visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household just loses to work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get the child to be more orderly?
We have not done it yet but have been working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
For me, there is no incentive to do it, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visitor and always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Is it better to have a bigger incentive or to remain sloppy?
I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically shaped cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for a near-unrestricted movement.
Specialized pre-formation with further joint pruning for improved movement freedom (at the arm and knee).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area was more than doubled with the Flex System 2 in order to enhance the comfort further.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality forms in the lower back area and step ensure a tight, perfect fit.
The 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility by the waist adjustment and improves comfort, especially when bending and when attaching and removing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and the back, guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Placed on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
No seam, thin (0.2 mm) sealing at the face on the hat increases the comfort, sealing and reliability (separate hat).
A soft, adjustable zone improves the sealing with a fine-tunable width adjustment by a gentle, non-intrusive Velcro closure, which does not interfere with the lining or stitching.
Double-layered arm and leg straps with a release buckle connect a adjustable inner sleeve with a soft, cushioned neoprene outer sleeve.
45° Inward curvature at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when fastening.
Long zipper at the neck with an elastic band reinforcement, for a anatomical cut with increased comfort without a hood.
Longer G-Lock P Rear Release Buckle (Without Hat) with Metal Slide and Integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Snap fasteners on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers, to prevent ripping if too much force is applied.
Neoprene Panels were glued together with external and internal overlapping.
The edges of the outer sleeves were seamed for greater durability.
The edges of the inner seams have been bent for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially during deeper dives (the System is compatible with all the popular armband computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I have completed a training in the field of Software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this job is not the right one for me, so I have been contemplating starting again and studying social work.
The Problem: I have an anxious (or avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
It roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come across as unapproachable.
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather not work as a Streetworker or in an open youth meeting but rather in substance abuse counseling or family services.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something online about it.
The ÄVPS has already caused me problems in my job (emotionally), since it always brings me down when it finds something to criticize in my code ("just another simple thing messed up") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know this by now"/"I'm just making things worse with my questions"/"he has to think of me as incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did they get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for it.
I am waiting for a pickup time.
What do they mean by return it please!
When I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message that your #PRS_ORG# has not authorized this book.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my chest of drawers.
The protein (Eiweiß) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its stomach and intestines into the individual amino acid building blocks (Aminosäuren). From these blocks the bird then builds its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather growth.
The feather formation of the nestling and the feather renewal of the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the organism as a whole.
Please take note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the reproductive cycle.
Following the dose of NEKTON-Bio, one should switch back to a daily intake of NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral supplement).

1 gram Nekton-Bio per 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft feed.
It is advisable to only prepare as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
A sterilized measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON Bio.
At strong feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until feather growth is completely finished.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be kept dry and away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is being sold as a office chair.
How can a office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
The worker's statement in contradiction to the policy.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree should be felled on our property.
A petition to the municipality has been submitted.
A worker wrote to me, saying that cutting down fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the regulations.
In the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the regulation is clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Okay, then I still have a spare sofa without using it.
Could you please offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euro and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you check it?
Emergency: Serious traffic accident near Selb.
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord interchange and Plößberg.
The police press alarm currently reports (14:03) that a car was overtaken in the wrong lane.
There are injured people.
I understand.
Great, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career life.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre, because my beloved head is currently denigrating everything it can.
Before I go on with this.. in short: I need advice and it's best if it's from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the recon as a quarterback.
Originally, I was studying something else and worked in a related field (so as to remain anonymous, I will not specify any details here).
It was all too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun.
Eventually I landed a job as a teacher and was sure it was the one - even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I'm googling other job postings" place.
And it has been only half a year.
Before each painting I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can always turn back.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Although there are vacations, there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the game, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but it was my weekend and my celebration day.
I had freedom.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moments.
Now it's too much stress for me.
And then there are these static structures that bother me additionally.
In general, it is fun and from the outside it looks like the Ref is going well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am totally exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it hasn't already done so.
I'm asking myself if I want to keep on like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions -, or if I should rather go back to the old area, where I felt appreciated, had free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but adequately paid and in a team.
But then I ask myself whether I wouldn't be back at the same place a year later and unhappy.
You may notice that it is all a bit confusing, but perhaps you outsiders can provide some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, in which I am completely finished and almost start crying at the smallest thought.
I will not make any decisions now because it is likely to lead to something bad.
But maybe your views can help me to at least see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which would be enough for now.
Thank you for reading and apologizing for my whiny tone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since their introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously improved, resulting in a combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scheme, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new Modeling Engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amplifiers contain, of course, the three-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This relies in part on real analog circuits, as these can capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this complex circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only gush out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even change and manipulate historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Since then, it has been refined several times in order to meet the new sound requirements, which resulted in a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was designed so that all guitarists on the search for a maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage particularly determined the tube character of the amplifier and developed accordingly the VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
The 12AX7 tube-loaded Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, 104:106.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure panels, it can be adapted to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-frame reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses, and an on-camera flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can store a lot of accessories.
If you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and photography-unrelated items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, since the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic Eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused immense damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has become the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the West Coast of Africa.
No reliable data is available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has slightly decreased in the past days, but volcanologists were still reluctant to make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-run TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
About 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, with the damages estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses were created off the coast due to cooled lava, with a combined size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is vital for the island, was particularly hard hit, with about half of the 85,000 inhabitants depending on it either directly or indirectly. It had already been in a state of crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were heavily affected, as reported by the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is standing at the door and the children are eagerly awaiting the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to create something alluring.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that can still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas gift-giving tradition, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "social contract" between primitive peoples, can be freed from the rigid routine and refilled with life.
How Nicholas became the Christkind.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days so closely with the gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in various ways.
The background of this still popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have secretly dropped gold into three women's windows to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular German custom of filling shoes with gifts for children arose.
Protestants were offended by this practice, as they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christkind and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details so closely, it only angers a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas celebrations with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the Advent season.
Today, one can find shoes in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to highly desirable luxury watches, fulfilling everyone's desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving gifts on St. Nicholas' Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the giving of gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian-oriented countries, there is a cheerful hubbub about who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the region whether the Christkind or the Weihnachtsmann appears on Christmas Eve. The Weihnachtsmann is essentially a kind of Nikolaus who has acquired certain characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white drunken beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his slew, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings bring the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has become quite famous.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that are pulling the slew as a troika.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

The police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The Police informed that a caller had reported a man with a weapon had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by the police.
It sounded like shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist attack.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

Pill Problem
Hello lovely womenfolk,
I hope I did everything right, it is my first post on Reddit after a year.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago because I was experiencing unbearable pain during my period and terrible PMS symptoms before my period.
I would rather stay here because I already take too many medications that I have to take.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten a two-year break from work and had picked up 100 explosive pimples all over my face.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
In the two years of pause, it never really normalized.
Someone might have some tips to avoid this situation in the future.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and quiet, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
The love of skin is so nice.
He had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large knotty patches and the acne problem.
I have tried various diets during my chronic illness and have settled on a sugar-free, milk-free, meat-free diet, as nothing else has worked as well.
It could also be that it's simply the worm in there, but if I'm like this everywhere I'd rather not search any longer what else is wrong.
I had already given her colleague the seminar paper.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I had to keep working and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe something was wrong.
But is he generally there?
since he is available in black in great quantity.

A 110-kV underground cable will be built in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The Government of Bavaria's Plan Approval Decision makes the way clear for the construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has shared it now.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the village and the existing 110-kV line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the overhead power line.
Good Morning
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue Betsellnumber #PRS_ORG# with the shippingnumber #NUMBER# was returned to #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is now definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget it, I already explained it to you yesterday!!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
My commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come in due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The origin value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the query is at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Planning a lesson (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been enjoying teaching since the summer, but I currently have great difficulty planning my lessons in geography in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can only use the board, a textbook, and a projector as my medium.
In school I can only copy software for free (which is annoying).
I need to plan my hours very carefully at the moment.
We are currently discussing geographic factors, and each hour is standing for itself.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need it for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books, which my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unsatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a teacher of Earth science can help me become more time-efficient when working with the book.
That would make me really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
The retail industry is concerned about the Christmas shopping season due to the 2G rule.
Most shops allow only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments losses of sales.
He had also prepared a possible solution.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations will damage the important Christmas shopping season for the retail industry.
Complaints have been made about a decrease in sales of non-daily items, according to HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year has now become a hole with no bottom", said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost approximately one third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's going well only in the grocery and convenience store businesses and online.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business manager.
"Shopping with 2G doesn't bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he emphasized.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required a high personnel expenditure.
He demanded the nationwide approval of the Band-Aid regulation.
After that, each customer must be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the given band.
Furthermore, in the retail sector - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should random checks be sufficient.
Even the shopping center-specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona levels, with the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping season, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts will be made to find solutions and to obtain approval.
This would include the so-called Band-Aid solution, where the visitors would have to present their 2G-proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to one found in a club hotel - would be able to freely enter all the shops.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a mistake, which was tried to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and taped it up.
How do I need to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
One of the special features of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lightbulb produces a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
In addition, they are also used in reporters' situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness almost without affecting the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the filmset or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is installed in hard to access places.
On the back of the light there is a control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
The user's storage has three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply done by pressing longer on one of the storage buttons and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for operation with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display windows (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the included power supply.
Installing the spotlight is very easy.
They have a 16mm threaded hole for attachment, so you can directly connect your camera.
The inclination can be reliably set using the leveling screws at both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components were extremely high-quality, so that they could also be relied upon for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a steering angle sensor is included in the delivery.
The delivery package is great, since it contains a bag as well.
You can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might buy without any problems.
I gave her a gift and it was too small :(
We wanted to throw a party: Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, it appeared that the recently winless Hessen were on their way to yet another Bundesliga defeat.
However, the SGE then turned it around, scoring five goals within an hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre season start. "It's insane what the boys have done today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN, speaking a "general praise" to each of them.
Initially, it looked like it would be another dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, who were still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What then happened, impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, according to Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who had been on the field for the first time since the fourth game and had overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and beamed with joy at the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner will now keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself in a good position regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wanted to "step by step" continue and remain modest, and to complete the tasks until the end of the year "on this level".
Next up is an away game for Borussia Mönchengladbach in Manchester United's home stadium on Wednesday evening (18.30, Sky).
I am returning the package to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect the call, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order has to be cancelled again?
For me, it would mean that I wouldn't order again since it has already taken too long.
Have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
The German handball national team had caught a few breaks days before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's handball team slunk away from the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after their humiliating defeat against Denmark.
The German national team suffered a heavy defeat in the final round of the World Championship, losing 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now face Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany closed the Group III round-robin with 8:2 points as runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game for all of us", said captain Emily Bölk.
To keep the dream alive of winning a first medal since 2007, a significant improvement is needed in the fight for the quarterfinals against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following day.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, who scored six goals.
"We were not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense", said midfielder Xenia Smits and urged: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not on the same level from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the kickoff.
Mistakes in the attack and technical errors in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on Betriebstemperature and prevented further damage with some saves.
The DHB team scored a goal after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
The expected initial spark was not this, however.
The German women's team was unable to make much of an impact against the aggressive Danish defense - and when they did manage to create chances, they were usually foiled by Althea Reinhardt's strong play in the Danish goal.
The game ended in a 3:10 score after 20 minutes, as Mia Zschocke was shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals she can participate again.
It wasn't until the closing minutes of the first half that the DHB team started to play better and managed to get the score up to 5 goals by the break.
The already faint hope for a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes with the score of 9:19.
The Groen-Schützlings sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for the medals at the end of the season.
In the following, the German team was unable to further improve their performance and went off the court as a clear loser.

Does it work there?
The title is available, I am currently working as an immunization doctor in mobile immunization teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished, it will go on to the next part in the vaccination centers for me.
I will answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will the vaccination be compatible with it?").
My area of responsibility includes informing people about vaccination, assessing the indication (person has a right to vaccination according to the CoronaVaccination Ordinance and no reasons to oppose it), documenting the medical records and, if necessary, providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical office assistants.
In vaccine teams, we often do not have pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but "only" (please, no lack of respect!) pharmaceutical technicians, who can not perform vaccinations (can not?). Therefore, I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger knows the solution.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This Amberger dialect word sent in by a viewer has caused much thoughtful reflection in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unrecognized by the callers in the series "Host me?"
No, it was not a "nervous man".
And also none, "everything must go quickly".
People heard from the TV moderator that it was completely false.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused much astonishment among many people in the region.
The audience learned that the "Huidlerer" was a rag, with which someone was wiping the oven.
Antony Rowley, a dialect researcher who has been frequently consulted by the Bavarian Television for years, confirmed it.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more widely known Mundart word "Houden".
Which closed a educational gap - even for many who have already been living in the area Amberg for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for the last two weeks.
After confirmation, always a error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Is choosing tires for a road bike really so puncture-proof?
I woke up this morning full of energy to start preparing for my bike tour in the next week, at least to do a little training.
I said, I did it and I cycled with my new racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then it happened, what is waiting in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Zach, loud squeaking and my rear tire refused to go any further.
Since I couldn't get a proper replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with less than ideal conditions and turn around and go home again.
It was not quite as bad, perhaps it is better to practice the bike check again before the ride.
Now I am standing before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have to cover a long distance over several days, I would really rather not get this problem again.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had given me the bike until 2 pm and had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding them for years) were also worn out.
When I think about having to do a tire change after driving for 80-90 kilometers, I'm really grumpy :D
I was talking to an older man at the train platform when he asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplatable.
Now it sounds very attractive.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering: I think I'm pedalling my bike 25 times around the block.
There is also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend another type of tire for my road bike?
The Schwalbe's page seems to be absolute! Do you recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver killed.
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car when he crashed into a central island for unknown reasons and then veered onto the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the publication of our new High End headphones B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO Series got some new additions.
SOLO 15 is the new sprout and it reminds visually of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design includes a foot that is perfectly suited for the job, to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted to the given circumstances at home.
The Solo 15 is very suitable for persons for whom the maximum volume is of secondary importance, but an exceptionally high sound quality is desired.
A 10 cm speaker is not able to generate nearly unfiltered high sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
In contrast, she stands out impressively mature and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone increase.
This is generally done to optimize the strongly increasing bundling at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is aimed exactly at the listening spot and convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone area can be reduced and the sound image made warmer by turning it slightly outward.
Thanks to the point-source, the location of each component of a music piece is extremely sharp and amazingly precise.
The suspicious low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM generate an enemy dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 not only adds to our SOLO Series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to consider the final optical appearance of the speaker at the beginning of the build, in order to plan appropriate changes accordingly.
If one wants to, for example, furnish the housing, then the lowering of the speaker has to be adjusted accordingly, as it adds more material.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the hardware store), first a 8 mm hole had to be drilled in the floor plate at the appropriate spot, so that the cable could be run later on without any problems.
With the help of an overlay, now the speaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be applied laterally.
This opening should be faced with a 45° phase in order to maximize the interior opening area of the speaker chassis.
The four screw connection points of B 100 - 6 OHM will receive a break in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of them.
These will now be glued to the back, the lid, the front, and the floor.
Here, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The reinforcements can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example, by using prefabricated frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot, both sides, and the front.
Through the use of a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex port, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to smooth out all the edges of the actual box.
Even the upper side of the floor plate can be rounded with it.
In the following step, the footplate is glued to the bottom of the housing and additionally secured with long wood screws.
Then follows the marking and drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the connection points of the speaker chassis and the power cable.
After the casing was cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the back wall.
Therefore, one feeds the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm bore in the foot until reaching the terminal opening and letting it hang out approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loose there.
Following, the frequency switch will be prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation Manual Solo 15.
After the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is tightened, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet complete, follows.
Through the 35 mm basso reflex opening and with a bit of skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and seal it that way.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the dimming according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity is important, so that the Plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the Plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is trimmed to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen sound, a mat of sound-dampening material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I cancel an order and have it delivered in June instead?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which requires more planning and explains the short notice of the announcement.
However: There will be at least three people there, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start about 0:30.
Make sure to have some cold drinks ready, plan good food and get ready for an interesting, long night.
