I don't want to watch TV anymore...
Why did it become impossible for the Tekakon to appear on TV?
Yesterday, I watched an episode of Netflix's Chirori, but it was so boring that even the staff behind the scenes started laughing.
"It's not funny when you're just making a fool of yourself, but it's hilarious when a comedian is doing it," said the man with a smirk.
Even though the staff didn't laugh, the artist's bad attitude made the workplace unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and ordinary. Some of the artists are also unhappy with the attitude.
I can't believe how much horrible talk there is about artists.
It's hard to make a living, but it's even harder to be an artist, since the job is so mundane and repetitive.
There is a lack of proper recognition for comedians and other entertainers in the media and society, despite the fact that they are becoming increasingly popular.
Working in the industry can be monotonous at times, but touching upon the artistic side of things can be quite enlightening.
You're so silly!
When I couldn't go out because I was feeling too tired, I felt bad inside.

Instruction: You ordered a wireless mouse and it arrived, but the wireless version was expected. If you want a refund, it was said to be returned.
Even though it is troublesome to purchase a self-made PC, it is still worth considering since it is a famous place.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse from MSI was on sale for 3,280 yen (link to Gintama) at the start of the Gold Week sale.
Since the same price was found at the storefront, the possibility of price misconception was considered and the page of the wireless version was also confirmed to be 5,071 yen (Link to Unicorn). Therefore, there was no misconception of price when ordering.
Normal order emails arrived and the next day shipment emails as well.
The name "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless" can be found in my purchase history for both my email and my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order until the shipment of the wireless mouse that was ordered, I thought it would arrive at that time.
From here it became a problem, and after delivery it took several hours for the message "There was an error in product registration" to come.
That is what the email said.
We were selling the wireless version at a special price, but in reality it was the wired version.
They have already shipped the wireless mouse, so it must be included in their cargo.
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse only for a refund.
Use the wireless mouse as it is.
Choose an appropriate response.
It appears that the product page of the wireless version and the wired version has been mixed up, but even the purchase history, mail, and invoice have been changed to the wireless version without any reason.
I bought a product and sent it back to the store without understanding the difference between it and the original product. Is it possible to get a refund here?

Isolated again...The only bridge leading out of the town was washed away by the typhoon and flooding, so the residents had to buy three times as much supplies. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa Village, Furukawa District, Fukushima Prefecture.
The devastating impact of the 2019 East Japan Typhoon was particularly felt in the 3rd quarter of the year.
Mr. Matsumoto san : "At first, it was a feeling of'magic'."
It was a very strange feeling when I saw the only road connecting the mountain village to the outside world, the Highland Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the same family were left stranded in a state of isolation.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's great that the bus can come all the way from the station to the garden. You can just get off the bus and start walking, or if you're feeling lazy you can just hold onto the handrail and walk across the bridge. It's so much better than taking the bus and dealing with the traffic and the hassle of finding a taxi. It's really nice that they built the bridge so quickly." One month after the bridge was completed, it was washed away by a sudden rainstorm. For three months, the village was once again in a state of isolation.
Despite the two-year passage of time since the disaster, Matsumoto-san has been continuing to take action based on his lessons learned.
Matsumoto Shōrō san : "There is curiosity about 10 cases."
We should ensure that food such as canned goods, instant noodles, and cup ramen can be used for emergency food. To this end, we have increased the stock of emergency food by about three times compared to before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "I don't know when a disaster will strike me, so I'm trying to build up a little bit of a reserve and hope for the best." Meanwhile, Yamanashi-cho experienced an "unforeseen disaster" and Mr. Yamanashi shared his experience.
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to devise its own unique take on the matter.
The town of Kagami is planning to hold a special day to prepare for disasters in the future, on October 12th. The education chief, Takashi Kagami, says it's a good idea and hopes to make it an annual event.
I have become more aware of the potential for unforeseen events.

When buying a used house, beware!
The Hole in the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The newly established "Building Condition Survey System" is expected to boost the activity of the used housing market.
The price of real estate has been increasing, as has the price of renovation. The renovation market has also been expanding.
As the demand for inexpensive real estate increases, the popularity of words such as "station", "near station", and "direct connection" is rising, leading to a surge in construction of tower-like buildings. This has had a significant impact on the decrease in the number of affordable new constructions.
Although existing (used) housing share in Japan is still low compared to overseas, it is gradually increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started an inspection of building conditions for the purpose of ensuring safe and secure used housing transactions in 2018 (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a builder who has become skilled in residential construction checks the current situation and condition of the building, including deterioration, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers with the introduction of inspections.
By performing inspections before purchase and avoiding claims afterward, the seller can provide the buyer with a sense of security.
This discrimination is due to the competitive nature of the events.
On the other hand, it is possible to understand the condition of the used house you are going to buy in advance, and it is beneficial to be able to purchase it quickly.
On the system of the current building inspection, the main responsibility for leading the inspection lies with the seller.
Additionally, it is important to pay attention to such points as notification of the inspection system.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to inspect the building conditions when handling a property, but in practice, it is not obligatory.
● Inspection of used car dealers is a risk that is already being experienced in Japan. However, in foreign markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where used cars are actively traded, similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stages of buying or selling a home, the buyer typically requests a specialist such as an inspector or building surveyor to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the case of America, the inspection rate of used houses in the state is around 70 to 90%.
The main difference between a "seller-led" inspection and a "buyer-led" inspection is that the former is led by the seller, while the latter is led by the buyer.
The seller can usually see the condition of the building from a little distance, and try to sell it quickly at a higher price.
The buyer's side is considering the survey contents and taking appropriate measures to make the house comfortable and safe.
Even if it's the same inspection, both purposes and thoughts can get in the way.
For this reason, risks such as anxiety and worry have been pointed out regarding the Japanese system.
This country's retailers must adhere to the minimum standards set by the government when it comes to inspections.
Since detailed survey is not possible, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing customer cases and providing support to the customer is important.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the seller fails to report unfavorable survey results or shows "ingratitude".

The phrase "Ginza" has become a synonym for bustling shopping and dining scenes in various cities in Japan, such as Tokyo's Ginza district.
The Ginza, which is known as a silver coin factory, was moved from present-day Shizuoka City to Edo in 1612 (Kan'ei 17).
At the time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but when it moved to Ginza, it became known as "Ginza".
According to the news, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the entrance of Marunouchi was through the Nihonbashi Bridge. Then, a half island called "Edoji" gradually extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The leading edge of that island is currently located in Tokyo.
Tokugawa Ieyasu began the construction of Edo Castle and filled in the moat, leading to the development of the Kyobashi district.
We will further improve public health and develop water transportation by strengthening the digging of canals.
They dug a hole, filled it with earth from the ruins of the castle and Mount Inari, and built a shrine there.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worth taking a look.
People should know about the "Sacred Pilgrimage" of Ginza.
Every year, the "Silver Temple" pilgrimage is held in the Ginza district.
This shrine is the most popular tourist destination in the area. It is located in front of the famous Kabuki Theater.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki theatre.
On the one hand, "Ryukuou Fudou-Jin" is located on the second floor of Ginza Matsuya, while "Ginza Doutsu-Jin" is located on the ninth floor of Ginza Sengoku 9.
The shrines "Torii Shrine" and "Atsuta Shrine" are located in the depths of the road, but "Atsuta Shrine" is famous for being respected by the Kabuki actor Nakamura Kanzaburō. The "Torii Shrine" is located in the entrance of the Success Shrine Building 1F, and it is a non-public shrine other than the time of visiting the Hachiman Shrine.
This shrine is filled with many places to worship the kami, but few shrines worship the kagura.
In front of the shrine, a fox would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the shrine was built with the hope of receiving the good fortune of a bountiful harvest.
It has become prosperous as a large city like Kyoto and Edo, where commerce is flourishing. In addition, it has become a city of faith, as evidenced by its Ginza and its prosperity.

That pain in your knee, could it be "Chondromalacia Patellae"?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC - Yahoo! News)
The Editing Department: Recently, the pain in my knee has been persisting.
What kind of illnesses are possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of knee pain is varied, such as overuse, ligament and joint injuries, and inflammation.
Skeletal dysplasia is common among Japanese people.
Is it possible that the joints will become deformed due to editing?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
In reality, the surface of the joints are covered with a soft tissue, allowing for the absorption of impact and the smooth movement of the joints.
Taking part in activities such as aging, overeating, and intense sports can cause the soft tissues to become weak and deformed.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Is the joint contracture disease also found outside the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
You may experience pain in other parts of the body, such as the knee, wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, ankle, and heel.
Unfortunately, the most common case is knee chondromalacia, which is called.
Editing Team: What kind of structure does the joint have?
Professor Maruyama said, "The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are irregularly arranged."
Therefore, the part that is covered by this 2-layered structure is the joint cartilage, and the surrounding area is covered by the joint capsule.
The editing team is complicated and structured.
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
There is a layer of smooth tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule, which creates synovial fluid to lubricate the joint.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of Hyaluronic acid and Condroichinon sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joints smoothly requires good sources of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms do people with Scoliosis suffer from?
Mr. Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of viscoelasticity, so it can act as a shock absorber and prevent direct contact between bones.
Iwaba is playing the role of a cushion.
Unfortunately, if you continue to strain yourself, it can cause joint deformity, inflammation, and pain.

You can actually experience the thrill of the "Kaiji" series of gambling and games in real life! (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
Gambling manga series "Kaiji" centering on male characters which has become popular explosively.
There is a game with an extreme sense of purpose hidden in one of the flavors of the work.
[Picture] Just watching the feet move...... Challenging the bridge crossing!
Let's try to verify the game of Kaji that is actually playable or is being practiced in the planning video.
The trap-filled Pachinko character "Nu" appeared in the movie "Pachinko Breaking Bad Record".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the customers.
This "pond" has a large trap from the "Hedge Maze" and the "Moving Object" and the "3-Stage Culvert" which makes it almost impossible to infiltrate.
He employed every possible means to topple the giant, from pouring water from a barrel of vinegar to setting up a cement foundation.
The character "Nu" who appeared in the game "KaiJin" is actually a popular character in the pachinko industry, and many people are playing it.
Even though things like "One-Thousand-Yen Coins" and difficulty levels have been lowered, it is still possible to enjoy the atmosphere of collecting coins.
The "Star Side Party" held a cash prize for those who included a kai jin in their outfit, and the participants were ordered to do the Tetsubo-wari, or human horse racing, which is a part of the "Human Horse" event.
The debtors were running as fast as they could while carefully avoiding the thin steel bars installed atop the ground 10 meters above, and competing for speed.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win prize money, but the steel bar is only 4 pieces long and safety measures are insufficient, making the chance of death quite high.
This bridge was supposed to be developed as a VR game, but it is now a part of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles' home stadium, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi". It is possible to have an extremely close experience by walking on the bridge.
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors above ground), with a steel bridge at the end, and a "Victory Bridge" and a "Skywalk" leading to it. People can walk there.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Corey Feldman, the comedic actor, has become a sensation in Japan after uploading a video of himself walking across the famous Tokyo Bridge, claiming it can be experienced in Japan through the "Tokyo Bridge Walking" challenge.
This is a two-player card game called Ecard. 「 Ecard 」.
The Emperor's card is 1 piece, the citizen's card is 8 pieces, and the slave's card is 1 piece. Players are divided into two sides, the Emperor's side and the slave's side, and they play by using 10 pieces of cards in total.
This game has an excellent balance, the Emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the Emperor.
Kayama is struggling with a harsh rule of "If you lose, you have to cut your own ears off" as he battles against the River Rats.
A device that could sense changes in pulse and temperature, such as feeling the iPhone in one's ear, was able to read the mind by destroying the ear canal. The river Ganges was confused by the extreme value of its own body by cutting off the ear canal. Thus, it was victorious.
The card is available in stores, and can be purchased from places like Amazon.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, appeared in the movie "King's Game" alongside Fujiwara Tatsuya, and the video has been gaining a lot of attention.

Take a step towards the New Year, and generously give a push to the Tori-no-Otoshi at the Shinto shrine in Yasnaga.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Kagura Shrine (in the city of Yamagata). A giant ema featuring the Chinese zodiac animal of the upcoming year, the dog (Tora), has appeared there.
The students of Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed a shrine, visited the shrine on November 11th and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting original drawings of horses from apprentice craftsmen since last year.

Thinking about Proposals Workshop for 4 High School Students in Yamaguchi: San Diego News Digital
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
The student representatives of four high schools in Tama City are discussing the idea of continuing to live in Tama at a workshop.
As part of the survey and policy proposal business for the Tamano S.D.G.S. Mirarizuki Center, we will take into account the voices of the youth and present it to the mayor and other city leaders.
What is funny in such a situation?
When the student was asked about the quality of the teacher's question, he answered, "When many people are working together, it will become successful" and "When the drum is beaten, it will sound good".
The first ever event was held at the Sunshine Aichi Convention Center on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed various themes such as "an interesting town", "a livable town" and "a town to feel the atmosphere" while moving to the "island" that was decided by the "World Cafe" method.
Each thought was written on a slip of paper and organized by pasting it onto a model-making paper.
A town with many young people is lively and interesting, but it lacks the convenience of transportation such as trains and buses.
We have no points of disagreement; let's talk some more.
"I thought Tama-no was boring, but I was amazed to find out that I could cycle around the coast." - Tama-no Shokugyou High School 3rd Year Student (18).
The third-year student at Higashi High School (18) said, "The store is scarce, but the traffic is inconvenient, yet the natural abundance is beautiful," and started talking with the adults, not only about the regional issues, but also about the charm.
The second meeting in December was only for high school students. They organized the contents of their proposals.
The mayor and education chief are expected to make an announcement in February 2021.
The mayor of the same-center is talking about "to foster the hometown love among high school students and to make them actively involved in the community through various activities".

When I thought there might be a secret store hidden somewhere, I was amazed to find a new thing.
The store of the brand "Cotto" is about 1 meter long, and has a more compact size feeling than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I make something this short and curvy?"
When you look at it closely, you can see that it is a piece of cloth that has been carefully cut and sewn into one piece. The whole thing looks like a net.
The ends of the net are open so that stores can be accessed through them.
Although you cannot join them without sewing them together, you can wrap them around each other.

The documentary on the Beatles at Disneyland is super interesting.
Despite being directed by Peter Jackson, the film was a flop.
There are so many different kinds of feelings that I can get from a single beat of my heart……
Even though the gossip was about to break apart, it was still so dramatic that I couldn't help but listen.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I was able to understand Paul and George's conversations! I was so surprised! Then, I started to talk slowly and carefully, but it was too late. I had already been caught off guard.
It's so irritating when people are arguing and being unproductive, but the atmosphere is so tense that it's almost funny - like when Beatles fans get into a heated argument about which one is the best.
Then, everyone will start to perform in that special atmosphere.
From the phrase "What are you doing?" our conversation has evolved into listening to the song "That's the Way It Is". It's really boring.
It's amazing how quickly you can get the hang of Get Buck.
The beautiful, whistle-y song slowly grows louder and louder, and the scene is magical.
It's amazing how much you can see of the process of composing music just by looking at it.
After that, she just watched the performance and became happy.
Even though it was only one chapter of three, it was still very impressive. However, the greatest cause of the disbandment of the Beatles was their environment around them.
Four people started to sing a song together. They were so excited and started to dance. Then they decided to make a live performance. Where should they perform? Talking about it, a producer and some promoters came up with the idea of "Let's take the Beatles around the world!" They started to spread the word and soon they became popular. Everyone was amazed by their unique and wonderful performance.
Since the documentary is about to explain the director's interpretation, it is remarkable that Peter Jackson felt that way……
It seems that Paul is always surrounded by bad people in the movie scenes, so I thought he was the villain.

I had to change my job because I was getting too sick from the work I was doing. I had been working in the service industry, but I wanted to do something different. I thought about what kind of job I could do that was related to the service industry, but would be more interesting and fulfilling. I eventually decided to become a bartender, and it has been the best decision I've ever made. I love being able to interact with customers and make them feel welcome.

In America, a severe weather system is bringing a mix of rain, snow, and strong cold temperatures (Weather News - Yahoo! News)
A tornado outbreak occurred in South America from 10th (Friday) night to 11th (Saturday) day.
At this time, strong cold air from the south has caused the air to become extremely unstable, and cumulus clouds have developed rapidly.
Warm air from the Southwest has been flowing into the American South, resulting in a record high temperature.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Monday (9th) and Tuesday (10th).
In a place where strong cold of -30℃ or lower was felt near the sky of 5500m, a powerful front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and the chaotic clouds developed rapidly in the shape of a front.
It was observed that tsunamis were occurring regularly in the outskirts.
The southern region of America is prone to tornadoes, but the frequency of tornadoes decreases significantly from the summer to the winter. However, there are still many cases of severe damage during this period.
The record-breaking typhoon warning, which was announced on a single day in the winter season, reached 150 times closer than before.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in America has reportedly received over 400 reports of storms and tornadoes in just 10 days (Friday) alone.
It is understood that there are two distinct areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In the state of Kansas, the intensity of the tornado was displayed on the improved Fujita Scale (EF Scale) and reached the third strongest EF3 level, with instantaneous gusts of 70 meters per second either side of it being observed.
There is a possibility that further research will confirm an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the conditions of Japanese buildings in accordance with the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of JEF3, a typhoon that is comparable to the one in America, is high enough to cause considerable damage in Japan.

The voice of the world's largest ever recorded typhoon, Jebi, is being used to help victims in the disaster area. (Yahoo! News)
With regards to the damage caused by the typhoon in the western and southern parts of the United States, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11th (Japanese time: November 12th), showed a remarkable performance of exorcis...
CNN and other American television networks reported it.
Mr. Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
The full extent of the damage is still unknown.
Fear of death exceeding 100 people has spread in Japan.
Residents of KenTucky State, who were affected by the tornado, were seen carrying household items such as furniture and appliances from damaged homes to clear the debris on the night of May 10th and early morning of May 11th.
The range of damage from the storm was estimated to be around 250 miles (400 kilometers) this time, according to a meteorologist from CNN.
In the wake of the devastating tornado in Kennett, Missouri, the Christmas shopping season was marred by a 24-hour state of emergency at the large factory, resulting in immense damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were gone.
A woman felt the weight of the rescue worker as she was searching for the victim in the darkness under the thickness of the rubble. She was trying to help the victim from the smartphone and the Facebook live broadcast.
In the public broadcast that was aired, along with the woman's pleas for help and the sobbing of another woman, you could hear the singing of "Happy Birthday to You".
Anbara Brown, a convenience store employee in Meaford, Canada, was able to hide from the tornado warning in her basement with her 5-year-old son.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a fearsome sound like a low rumble of the ground.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take to rescue them. But we must continue our desperate efforts.
In California, a warehouse of Internet retail giants Amazon and other companies has collapsed, and at least 6 people have been confirmed dead.
The shockwave from the train car being detached is causing the fences to shake and the roads to be blocked by overturned vehicles.
According to US web media, an estimated 40 million apartments in Tennessee have been affected by the power outage.

It is an old saying that approaches to evaluation systems of star charts are different from each other.
Japan is arguing that it should add/subtract points based on three stars, while other countries are arguing that they should subtract points based on five stars from there.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, and four stars are "deficient element" and "beautiful work".
If a work is judged based on five stars, then the work that is not flawed can be considered the "highest standard" work. However, if the same system is used, the work that is not flawed will be judged as "perfect" and thus will be impossible to improve. Therefore, it is better to not present the star rating system on the current system.
If people continue to argue about this issue and try to prove their own opinions by using Steam's 2 reviews, the conversation will become meaningless.

Issue of Self-made Radio
I tried to make an AM radio with a condenser and coil but there was too much noise so I couldn't hear it clearly.
The frequency of the radio station I heard was different from the one I tuned in to.
Even though there was a chance that people would think it was expensive, I wanted to make it affordable.

<Saga News> Hakobune's "Fresh Seafood Sushi and Sashimi" - Make it at Home with Easy-to-Find Ingredients
"Freshly-Prepared Sushi and Sashimi from the Nearby Sea - Make Your Own Tasteful Tartar Sauce"
A colorful bounty of vegetables, carefully crafted into delicious takeout dishes at the specialty store "Hakobune".
"We want to make a restaurant where people can enjoy delicious food at a reasonable price," said Kikuchi Takayuki (39) and his wife, Yumi (38). The couple opened a restaurant in August last year.
One of the popular menu items at the sushi restaurant is "Fresh Seafood Sushi and Ebi Fry" (1000 yen).
Fish are sometimes bought as goods at the market.
"Freshness is the key to the flavor of bread crumbs. Ebi-fry is crunchy and direct in its flavor." (Kikuchi-san)
Ochazuke is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of mixed vegetables, deli meats, and Saga prefecture's mixed rice. It is usually served with soup.
Vegetables are usually grown in a home garden and then sold at local markets.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Mr. Kagayaki adds a touch of color to the table with his French-style cooking, such as ratatouille and salads.
On one hand, there is the flavor of dumplings and eggs, such as "Taste of the town" (Ume-san), which is enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
Popular is the "Hamburger" made from Japanese Domestic Beef (1000 yen).
From next year, we will also be selling the processed meat product "Sharky's Set" which can be used for making wine.

A Family's Long Journey to Protect the Environment in China (JBpress News - Yahoo! News)
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong companies, Find Asia company consultant) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with over 1,000 species of mammals, and 3,000 species of plants.
This region is also promoting environmental protection activities supported by the local government, in addition to recognizing the value of biodiversity and environmental protection activities by the local government.
Sìshuānpàn is one of the regions in China's southwestern part.
Siam Paran is a region located on the border of Laos and Myanmar, which is the starting point of the Tai (Tai) people and the Lue (Lue) people of the Kingdom of Thailand. It is a region where many minority ethnic groups live and work together.
The source river of the Mekong is flowing through and across Southeast Asian countries.
The Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture is located in the central part of China, with an area of only 0.2% of the country's total. However, it is home to 25% of the country's wildlife and 20% of its flora.
This time, I visited Lixin Liu, the founder of the environmental protection activity in Shanghai, and had a talk with him about the contents of the activity.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together. They have been doing it for 20 years.
What was the purpose of that?
Lee started our environmental protection action "Tenchu" in 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This place is the only tropical rainforest in China, and it boasts abundant biodiversity.
Despite that, the economic growth was slowing down.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, China was forced to produce rubber due to its shortage of rubber. In order to do so, vast areas of hot and wet rainforests were cleared in the past.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
After that, I was married to the journalist I met here.
Was Mr. Lee interested in nature conservation before?
Mr. Li, I am from Shishapangma, but I have no interest in the significance and biodiversity of tropical rainforests.
He had become accustomed to helping her with her projects, even though he lacked the knowledge himself.
Even though people don't look at the person with the high back, there are some people who are curious about it. Why is that?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.
In that moment of confidence, a natural thing will come out from within.
That person is sure to have a strong sense of self-confidence.
High-functioning, high-quality shoes are made by hand.

It's polite to comment on the other person's clothing, but it's better to be subtle about it, right?
Isn't it fine?
It's obvious, isn't it?
I think it's too complicated.
No one said anything, so I don't know what it means. It's a bit confusing.
How did you feel when you were embarrassed?
If you confessed to the police at the Yokohama station, what would happen?
I confessed to my crush and my heart is overflowing with spring fever. I hope we can meet again soon.
Then, by uniting, we can increase our knowledge of golf and share our interests with each other.

[Personal Memory/Environmental Impact] It took me about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD.
Despite the fact that there was not much time to play with the data that had become stable until the end of March, I felt like I had to spend a lot of time to identify the factors causing the CTD by examining the data during the weekends.
Why wasn't the.Net Script Framework used to analyze the logs? (It can be figured out in a few minutes.) Some errors are related to DLL and assembly conflicts, which can't be fixed by a crash log.
The timing of the main CTD is important.
* All plug-ins, such as Papyrus and.NET Script Framework, should leave a trace in the log.dll plug-ins.
If NPCs are killed in large numbers in a short period of time, the console will crash. This can be fixed by updating the SKSE plug-in or powerofthree's revised version.
* When the camera work for the kirmite activation against NPCs is off, it can be improved by setting the kirmite settings to off via the.ini file. However, the upper limit of the number of kirmite animations is 10,000, which may be a problem for DAR+Nemesis related settings.
* Field Movement + Partial Magic (e.g. Ice Curse) Activation, NPC Death: Dirt & Blood v2.0's SPID-enabled NPC Appearance Settings (MCM's Right Top) Off, 5 Consecutive Attempts Improved.
Is there a misconfiguration of armor and body meshes that can cause the actor/NPC to wear the default 2.0 SPID set? The default.ini has a syntax error but the result is intended to be applied to NPCs with the Perk.
Firstly, we focused on the OnHit and MOD (dll related) motion. We soaked our clothes in the water and checked the result. Unfortunately, it was not what we expected.
I couldn't find any similar bug reports even at the English, German, and French levels.
Those who are facing similar CTD problems in a Japanese language environment may find it helpful to refer to this post as a reminder.
Everyone is talking and laughing together in a mental way.

He was clearly mentally exhausted.
Although I am not retired yet, I feel like there is a limit to what I can do before I retire.
Thinking about the importance of mental health nursing - Today's visiting nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from double-sided disability, I have been receiving long-term care visiting nurses. I have been getting along with them for a long time and have built a very good relationship.
We have conversations about all sorts of things every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and dressings in the nursing care (such as wound care), it is more important for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which I found out in today's visiting nursing care.
Today, we discussed the differences between men and women, as well as gender theory, and it was quite amusing.
Talking about sexual desire between men and women, or how she decided to get a divorce, or such interesting topics can be discussed in a visit to the nursing home.
Although I am wearing a tamagotchi, I am gender-swapping.
When the visiting nurse station is located in a hospital, the hospital-based occupational therapist cannot be expected to provide any practical assistance, nor can the visiting nurse come and go as she pleases. Instead, she is told to "stay away from medical matters" from above, and is instructed to do so by talking about how the hospital is doing its job.
I am using the services of a Social Welfare Corporation, which is running a small visiting care station. However, I am treated equally with other patients, and I am thankful for the kindness of the caregiver, who is always good at her job.
You are so beautiful.
It is likely that both those who are receiving psychiatric care and those who are contemplating it will benefit from the experience.
Visiting a psychiatrist is very helpful for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor confirms it, please take it.
Then, choose a good visiting nurse station.
Even though I was angry, I released myself from the contract without any prior warning.
Drab Sorry.
Even though I knew it was a fake warning in English, I still couldn't help but laugh.
Why do you speak English?
When it comes to thinking about the cause, there are various things to consider, for example...
I don't know what people who made it are displaying in Japanese.
Difficulty in determining the language.
The browser settings have been changed to English preference.
The probability of appearing in the ranking is small when the number of draws in the lottery is 6, since all the numbers are odd.

The Japanese patent for water technology and the Chinese five-year plan for slowing down the economy have been leaked. (Central China News - Japanese Language Edition)
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, we aim to spread 6000 electric cars across the nation and operate 310 hydrogen stations.
The target price of hydrogen was 6,000 yen (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
Unfortunately, the target of 27% fuel cell vehicles in the 2011 fiscal year has not been achieved yet. (Approximately 1700 units)
The percentage of hydrogen stations in Japan has reached 38% (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is almost the same as the load map announced at the time of the previous announcement.
It became clear that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap is falling short of its targets.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) released a report on the "Current Situation and Policy Directions" of the Hydrogen Economy on December 12.
According to their reports, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Toho (Japan) supplies the core material of the automobile battery, such as carbon fiber, to Kyocera (Japan), DuPont (USA), Mitsubishi (Japan), Goodyear (USA), and 3M (USA).
Six countries are leading the hydrogen market, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany. The number of hydrogen technology patents registered in these countries has been increasing at an average of 14% per year since 2014.
Korea is the fifth largest country in the world in terms of patent applications in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020).
However, the WTO has been saying, "In reality, the major players in the water element market are six countries. In other words, they are the lower-tier countries."
The order of priority for patent applications by country is China, United States, EU, and Japan.
China has been expanding its lead over the United States since 2017, widening the gap from that year onwards.
In 2020, Japan was ranked fourth in the world in terms of patent applications, with 974, while China had 4721 patent applications, accounting for 22% of the world's total.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has proposed to designate "Hydrogen Technology" as a "National Strategic Technology" with large investment, research and development expenses tax exemption.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine as part of a training mission for its troops (CNN.co.jp).
A U.S. State Department official reported on December 12th that equipment containing firearms and explosives, based on the assistance plan approved by the Biden Administration, had arrived in Ukraine.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million dollars (approximately 68 billion yen), and the last equipment item, such as a radar station for identifying launch sites of rocket attacks, is being transported to Ukraine.
According to the US Defense Department, these weapons also included "Javelin" anti-tank missiles.
The purpose of Russia's military support for Ukraine is to strengthen its national defense capabilities in various ways, such as increasing its military power along the border.
The U.S. is monitoring Russia's movements and has been consulting with NATO allies and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to devise a response in case Russia invades Ukraine.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the White House on September 1, 2019, and admitted to accepting weapons assistance from the United States.
The scale of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine this year has reached around 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, and the total amount of aid afterwards exceeded 25 billion dollars.
The U.S. military also participated in Ukraine's training exercises.
The state of Florida sent troops to participate in the multinational exercises for the support of Ukraine.
According to the statement of the U.S. Department of Defense, the European special operations forces are playing a significant role in training and advising the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces deployed in Ukraine is still classified as a secret.
The Russian and Ukrainian leaders held an online conversation on the 7th of this month, but the talks were focused on the Ukraine issue.
The United States is showing its tough stance on economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The LDP's Akira Amari, who was in charge of tax reform, was directly attacked for advocating for the suspension of the consumption tax.
The first special issue of Weekly Diamond magazine, published on December 18th, is titled "Family Talk at the End and Beginning of the Year".
This is the art of giving and receiving before death.
In the discussion of integrating the taxes on gifts and pre-gifts, the dreadful 2022 tax reform was brought up, but in the near future, pre-gift giving may be restricted more and more as a form of tax evasion.
What will change the rule of succession?
The LDP's former tax chief, Koichi Kato, has been actively promoting tax cuts and other economic policies since the party's victory in the 2019 election. He has been sharing his knowledge on taxation and other economic policies without reserving any topics for later.
(Diamond Editing Department, Miyahara Keiichi)
We should consider the taxation of pre-emptive donations from the perspective of taxing the transfer of assets, and make a neutral tax system that takes into account the timing of asset transfers.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill announced by the party last year has caused a great stir throughout the entire society, from the wealthy to the middle class.
Why would we want to change the rules of synchronization and taxation? Because if we can make "pre-birth donations" illegal, we can greatly increase the taxation of synchronization.
The steel rule for reducing tax liabilities is "to reduce taxable income by reducing taxable assets".
That powerful legacy gift has been widely utilized by companies even though it is a small amount, since it is tax-deductible even for those who own a home in the three major cities.
This discussion is about the concept of "unified taxation" of income and donations.
On December 10th, 2020, the 22nd Annual Tax Revision Committee released a draft of the tax reform plan, titled "Making Clear the Nature of Gift and Inheritance Taxes". The plan proposed a number of changes to the current tax system, such as clarifying the nature of gift and inheritance taxes, increasing the tax-free allowance, and introducing a new taxation system for inherited assets. The committee also stressed the importance of continuously reviewing the plan in order to ensure its effectiveness.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Audit, Mr. Kamiyama, were speaking.
For that reason, it is most important to equalize the advantages and disadvantages of transferring wealth at different times.
"Underneath it all, what kind of problem is likely to arise due to the process of unification, and where is the simulation taking place?" The chance to make a donation before death has been reduced to three times.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, in the near future we should avoid acting in the direction of cutting large taxes and instead prioritize pre-birth gifts.
How will the rules of succession tax and donation tax change specifically?

The team that won the first three games of the NFL season felt a variety of emotions, according to the players (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News).
Johnson's pass was intercepted three times in this game.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season when the Dallas Cowboys played the New York Giants in the infamous "Battle of the Boroughs" game. It was the second and last time the two teams met in the same season.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, a talented RB who had broken the season record of 2000 yards for the first time in history, played for the Buffalo Bills.
Simpson and Blakeson ran the RB Gym together and defeated the other runners.
The reason for the maximum offensive of the Payton Rottweilers was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains unchanged in terms of latitude from Hokkaido's Sapporo.
The temperature dropped significantly before the game, with a wind speed of 18m/s, and snowfall had already begun.
Unfortunately, the play selection didn't change much.
You should run 25 times for 30 passes.
Alen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
Interception was impossible, but we persisted indefatigably.
There were 4 Red Zone invasions in the Offensive Series and the Defensive Team got 10 points.
After the third quarter, they continued to run all the way to the red zone.
Unfortunately, she was only able to steal three points in that game.
The defense in the final round of the game.
The building that was chasing after the 4th penalty was arrested at 3rd & 9, and became 3rd & 14.
It is 18 yards to the goal.
The quarterback was surrounded by the defense's rush at the 3rd&14 and eventually escaped to the right side of the field by throwing the ball from the pocket.
He threw a pass but it was unsuccessful.
In this game, WR Steffon Diggs ran around the end zone and became free, but Allen's eyes were not able to catch him.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from the outside of the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabriel Dumont. The pass was incomplete and Arlen Harris failed to reach the end zone, resulting in a failed attempt.
Although Brain was covering the WR Cornerback position with his body, he suddenly released the ball and reacted to the pass in the middle of the game.
The receiver watched the ball fall to the ground twice and then passed it to the endzone.
Although it was difficult to decide the route for the 4th down, there was no need to target the TD for the 3rd down.
If you can achieve a first down in two attempts at the play, it will be worth it.
Since it was still 2 minutes before the 4th & Short event started, I decided to run there and see if my ability to survive could be proven.

3 items to make your kitchen more organized in the long run: 1. A timer 2. A replacement for your cutting board 3. A storage container (Harper's BAZAAR)
Sponge
Even if you frequently change the sponge, it will eventually become worn out and will need to be replaced.
Even though kitchen sponges are often used to clean dishes, they can also be a source of bacterial growth if not properly sanitized. Recent research has revealed that bacteria can rapidly multiply in kitchen sponges even when they are exposed to electronic sanitizers.
The German researcher who conducted this study is encouraging people to exchange one sponge for a clean one once a week.
A smooth board.
The US Department of Agriculture is suggesting that once the scratches and gouges have been made, the panels should be replaced.
Whenever a wound or a fissure advances, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria start to proliferate.
Even if you are still healthy, it is important to frequently disinfect your tabletops and surfaces with a 1:16 dilution of a non-scented liquid disinfectant.
Submerge a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.
Use a clean paper towel to gently wring out the water.
Dishware that has chips or cracks.
Discarding your favorite magic cup is painful, but the empty surface will become a new warm bath for bacteria and viruses.
It is also possible that the cause of the coughing or drinking problem is due to the missing part of the throat.

Since I have only a limited ability to understand English, I will judge the translated text only.
The text that has been translated feels a bit discordant, but I can understand what it wants to tell, and there is no obstacle at the level of playing. (I tried it out and it seemed to work out well for me.)
This translation of the level in a game made overseas is often seen, and it is surprisingly well-translated even though it is from a small company.
Can people who don't have a native understanding of the Japanese language eventually grasp the subtle differences between the nuances of the language through long-term study? That's up to them to decide.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if Japanese people are not bothered by the feeling of discomfort, they will explore other people.

After studying the sword "Kamiwakaru Kodachi", I have become strong enough to fight in a battle.
The exchange of effort is the essence of humanity, as seen in the anime "Ueki no Honoo". (QJWeb Quick Japan Web)
Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been causing a stir among the youth. It is said to be full of "exciting" and "daring" content.
There is no battle in the story, even if it is read during the day or night, and the readers' popularity has become a fixed point.
It was only after two years of hard work that the same manga "One Piece" was completed, with the artist drawing only with a brush and no color.
The mysterious charm of the exotic landscape is one of the attractions of the place. However, there is a tendency that people tend to stay in the same place and not to change it.
After the main character, Burakawa Toshirō, completed his training with the sword of the exorcist, Kagemitsu Toshirō, he was ordered by the latter to seize the life of a certain person, who was trying to buy the life of his own. This was the beginning of the story.
Weaklings have no rights, no choice, and no power. They can only be oppressed by the strong.
The "thief" who introduced the "demon slayers" near the "Kinshachi" shrine was a brave and generous person (even though it was done in a cowardly manner).
When the first contact between Shiro and Kagami happened, Shiro was told that "If you were to be eaten by a human, what would you do?" and Shiro replied with "It's too late to make a decision now."
In the midst of fan chatter, a never-ending stream of meaningless banter ensues.
It is possible that a moment will come when I am forced to make a decision between following my sister and walking away from the demon.
This can be called an initiation from the imagination to the work.
We set off to climb the mountain in the mist, taking Carrot-san with us. We descended to the mountain hut by the time the sun rose.
Before climbing a mountain, it is important to prepare for the possibility of death. This includes preparing for the possibility of avalanches, crevasses, and traps.
Even though it was made by human hands, it was sniffed out with a sharp and discerning nose, so it was called "human correction".
Even though it was sudden, he was able to avoid the entire thing by using his high physical strength. However, it was only a matter of time before he was defeated by the demon.
Ordinary people suddenly become powerful without knowing the secret of the hidden strength and skill. If they wake up, they can use the power and technique they have developed until now in a natural way.
Those who put in effort are entitled to get paid, but those who don't put in effort should not expect anything in return. The rule of "No work, no pay" is not applicable to the superhuman force of effort, which is celebrated in a different manner in this work.

Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it would integrate the CE and IM departments as the Set department and name it DX (Device eXperience) to reflect it in the organizational restructuring to be done by the end of the year.
Through various services for home appliances and mobile phones, the goal is to strengthen user experience (Experience).
Samsung Electronics recently announced a new business division, DX, which integrates the CE and IM departments and consists of VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, and MX (Mobile eXperience).
Those related to Samsung Electronics described the name change as reflecting long-term business structure and future direction, global leadership and strengthening.
We emphasized the idea that by providing products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment that reflect customer needs, we could create a delightful experience for consumers.
The successful launch of an integrated ship-of-the-company system, which transcended organizational boundaries and created a platform for synergy effects, was also the basis for the creation of differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is envisioning a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the seamless connection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones, based on the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Consortium.
Is 1500BCE before the Common Era?

It was around 1500 years ago.
In recent years, the use of BCE (Before Common Era) instead of BC (Before Christ) has become more common, as a sign of respect for those who are not Christians.
BC is an abbreviation for "Before Christ".

Perhaps.
I think that part of the armoured head looks like it was covered in scales in the same way that the giant monster in the movie Alien was wearing a helmet.
A 24-car collision occurred in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The driver of the truck was uninjured, but he was charged with careless driving. (Television Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, a 24-seater bus collided with another vehicle and the driver was arrested and taken for medical examination. It was revealed that the driver had no injury, but carelessness was the cause of the accident.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Matsumoto City, and 12 people were injured in the accident.
The police arrested 54-year-old suspect Noguchi Yasuhiro, who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing a hit-and-run accident on November 7th, and sent him for further investigation on the 12th.
The suspect's car was still moving forward without braking after the crash and the fire department arrived shortly after the accident, confirming that the suspect had lost consciousness temporarily.
Unfortunately, it has been revealed that the suspect in the Nishikawa case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching the suspect's home and investigating the current situation in detail.

Oginomamoru's Kin-Ku-Man review [Comics Chapter 4]. (Weekly Pure News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, has come to an end in Volume 4!
The first chapter focused on the preliminaries, but this new challenge is drawing attention and depicting the entire tournament!
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review by Oginamax ★★★★ (Star 5 out of 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the matches even begin!
This volume is filled with detailed dialogue and tells the story of the Knockout Match between Kin-Rubber Man and Robin Mask, but first we must prepare for the ring battle. Therefore, it is not a volume filled with the Knockout Match alone.
We started from the basics and gradually improved our skills in teamwork, tactics, and formations. We also trained hard to create a unique and powerful atmosphere for the match. Despite all of this, there was no guarantee of victory.
As the tension built up gradually in the middle of the story, the reader could feel the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming battle. This feeling was heightened even more by the author's skillful writing, making it seem as if the reader was truly part of the calculation.
Thus, the important match was decided in the third place playoff between the Terryman and the Ramenman.
While waiting for her to arrive at the venue, my favorite wrestler had been greeting her with a poster, "from now on, I'll be the one to take care of you!"
He is trying to tease her by tickling her chest.
However, the silent Tamakoma-mura man suddenly stopped the man with the knife and simply stared at him, causing the scene to be completely separated from the others.
This is the last chance to fight the powerful Kinnikuman inside the tournament. There is no other opportunity to challenge him.
Despite the fact that it is so difficult to find a suitable partner, I am still trying my best.
You won't be able to resist imagining a vibrant future when you see something like that!
It's surprising how much trouble a single character can cause, and now I'm getting a taste of what it's like to be a manga artist!
Although the fight between those two was short and ended without a break, the ring scene was filled with the tears of the loser after the match.
"You must not rely on only your own strength! Believe in the power of the gods!"
That is a lifelong struggle.
You may have been thinking that the protagonist could not lose since he was the main character, but it turns out that he was not as powerful as he seemed. Even though the reader expected the protagonist to win, since he was the main character, it turns out that he was not as powerful as he seemed.
By making this speech to Ramen Man, Yudetamago Sensei was able to slip a knife between their fingers without using their hands.
Readers will ask, "Can a skinny guy like Kin Man really knock down a giant like Robby with just his strength?"
Why are you curious?
It seems like the writer is trying to imagine what the future will look like, even though they can't see it. They are also trying to create something new and unique, just like their teacher who bound them with ropes.
This is a great thing to do.
I think this is the most important point of the whole story.

He tried again to enter her room after he warmed it up.
3.) No activation.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will flicker for a moment, but it will stop immediately.
After that, there was only silence.
I tried plugging in the power plug again, but it didn't work.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin, connect only 4 pins and try to power on without unplugging other parts.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles Bubbles Bubbles" has been coming from the PSU fans for a long time, but it is not the cause of any problems.
