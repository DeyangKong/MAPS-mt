This is one of the important skills certificates I feel proud of besides my driving license!
Rescue measures are taken when there is an emergency, such as when responding to an emergency vehicle.
救援车在事故发生后的过程中真正的关键时间只在一段时间内。	In reality, the rescue process of the ambulance after the accident is the most crucial part of the time, which is limited to a certain period of time.
当时候却是需要急救的时候。	This was the time when help was needed urgently.
如果你真的有心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，你的生命的窗口只有4分钟，黄金4分钟！	If you really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, your window of life is only four minutes, gold four minutes!
急救的人朋友吧！	So, your friends are important!
当我们在一个危险的情况下面面有人倒下时，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。	When faced with a dangerous situation, we should not just stand still and do nothing, but instead use our professional knowledge to rescue the person, rather than feeling helpless.
In China, there are about 300,000 unexpected deaths due to heart attacks every year, making it the most dangerous type of sudden cardiac arrest.
在美国全国，救援机构总数量达到15%。	In the United States, the number of rescue organizations nationwide is 15%.
在拉斯维加斯的赌场酒店，百分之七八十能救过来，上海、北京低于1%。	In Las Vegas, the casino hotel saved 78%, with Shanghai and Beijing below 1%.
This is what Lu Lei, the founder of the first reaction, said.
如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸没有了，心跳没有了，你不会有任何效果。	If someone has a heart attack, no breathing, no heartbeat, you can't do anything.
人工呼吸、胸外按压、或者其他手朋友帮助，可以把人救过来。	Artificial respiration, chest compressions, or other help from bystanders can potentially save a person's life.
我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。	We still don't have enough people with this kind of awareness to quickly learn and save, so I'm urging everyone to study this skill and be prepared for any emergency.
它可以挽救一个人的生命，不管它是哪里的人。	It can save a life no matter who it is.

南非医生认为，新型诊断工具可以让医疗师更好地找出病症的原因，但传播速度可能会更快。	South African doctors believe the new strain of the virus is more contagious than the old one, but the rate of transmission may be faster.

教育时评:拯救被拐儿童要靠什么？	Education evaluation: What can we do to save the children from being left behind?
如果类比“没有买卖就没有杀害”的著名公益广告语，那么，在没有“收拐”需求的良好环境里，群防群治、全民反拐，使拐卖行为无利可图、风险大、成本高，这类犯罪也就不会屡屡发生。	If the famous pro-social advertising slogan is "No purchase, no sale, no harm", then in a good environment without coercion, prevention and deterrence, the crime of bribery will not occur continuously.
近日，公安部刑事侦查局正在拐办一批儿童失踪信息，并在网络上即将上线。	Recently, the public security bureau has been investigating a number of missing child reports and will soon make the information available on the internet.
为了发布儿童失踪信息，建立一个准确、快速找回儿童的网络信息平台。	This is to establish a reliable and fast platform to find lost children.
听闻此App名为“团圆”，感觉冷静吧。	After hearing the name of the app "Tuan Yuan", you will feel cool and relaxed.
新技术方法名称“文艺 ” 、 情怀滩滩，但它们可以彼此让它们吸收，实用、有效。	New technology methods are named "Wenxi" and "Huimin" and can be used together to be effective and practical.
首先要找回被拐吧，保警寻人身安全、自由。	First, we must find the lost child and protect their safety and freedom.
第二次，审判与惩罚各自的议题才开始。	The second topic was the trial and punishment of the suspect.
刑事惩罚的意义，从个人惩罚、社会防范到法律教育，可以列举很多“大词 ”。	The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed as follows: individual punishment, social prevention, legal education, etc.
但在拐卖案件告破之前，应优先关注被害人的人身安全。	However, before addressing the issue of breaking the strike, one should prioritize the safety of the injured person.
在急剧中，议题如“儿童是否应当一律死刑”，可以暂停议题讨论，但救助被拐儿童的事情不可停止。	In the midst of the heated debate, topics such as "whether children should be subject to capital punishment" can be put on hold, but rescuing a child from execution cannot be stopped.
经验上，人贩子往往会在得手后快速地让遗件远离作案地点。	Based on investigative experience, people often quickly dispose of evidence after committing a crime.
孩子在找拐一分钟后，可能会更远离家长一步，侦破案件的难度也就会增加一分。	If the child searches for a minute, they may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of finding the lost item will also increase.
在这种情况下，拿出“团圆”平台可以很有效地帮助捕获案件，寻回孩子的行动很可能会有效果。	In this case, extracting "roundtable" platform can be very effective in helping to apprehend criminals, locate missing children, and so on.
然而，“打拐”是需要各方面的合作以及各领域的法制系统做好一件大任务。	However, "打拐" requires the cooperation of all parties and the implementation of a comprehensive legal system.
执法保障，以及执法缜密，无不需要贯彻“护幼扶弱”的关怀。	The protection of children and families, from the perfecting of the law to the safeguarding of justice, and the secrecy of the execution of the law, all require the constant remembrance of "defending the weak".
儿童预防拐议，家庭各项做法可以更好。	In addition, prevention of child abuse can be done in both family and society in a better way.
例如，一家几个人在火车站休息，父母睡着，孩子却不见了。	For example, a common scenario is that a family of three was taking a nap at the train station, only to wake up and discover that their child was missing.
孩子不可期待，但家长应该具备相当的保护意识。	Parents cannot expect a two-year-old to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, they should at least have some basic protective awareness.
孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，孩子准备准备准备，��
一方面正在打击拐卖犯罪，另一方面正在购买被拐儿童，但是这两者都应该被关注和惩治。	From both sides, efforts are being made to combat illicit trafficking, but at the same time, one side is also buying and trading in children, which should be monitored and controlled.
一个不法行为，往往只是一环长的链条中。	A single unlawful act, often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese Criminal Law, the sentence for selling children is 5 years; if the circumstances are especially severe, the death penalty can be imposed and the convict's property can be confiscated.
在“轻刑化”的大趋势下，儿童罪显然属于处罚较重的罪。	In the current trend of "light punishment", child crimes are more likely to be serious offenses.
今年，拐卖案件发生不少，但是，它们不仅仅在拐卖行为中，还可能会发生在各种不同的情况下。	This year, there have been many cases of counterfeiting, but they are not limited to the sale of counterfeit goods. They can also happen in various other situations.
可见，部分人在养育儿女方面的观念落后，法律意识淡薄。	It is clear that some people's attitudes towards child rearing have become more lax, with their legal awareness becoming increasingly blurred.
准备好的教育早期启动，各方应该同步跟进。	Prepare for early childhood education, both sides should synchronize their progress.
要有效控制拐卖犯罪，不能仅靠官方严格执法，也需要各行各业的合作。	To effectively control counterfeiting, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement of laws.
当市场各种产品的拐卖方式多样化，拐卖者可以各种方式拐卖，形成拐卖论坛，拐卖行动势陷入低效泥淖。	When the selling of various products in the market becomes diversified, sellers can choose various ways to sell, forming a selling forum, which may lead to low-efficiency losses.
因此，让让让它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它它

He systematically expounded on the spirit of the party from a comprehensive perspective, delving into the essence and concretely applying it.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches given by Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang with the spirit of the provincial and national congresses, and strengthen the sense of unity and defense of the "two unities" and "two consolidations" in an instinctive, political and practical way.

国际橄榄油协会将橄榄油分为初榨橄榄油（Virgin Olive Oil）和精炼橄榄油（Lampante Olive Oil或Refined Olive Oil）两大类，五个级别。	The International Olive Council will divide olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five grades.

你好，餐厅的口水鸡正在生长。	Hello, the chicken that was brought to the restaurant is growing.
想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手。	You can try out net-pass for a low price and get used to it before investing heavily.
不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。	Unfriendly, in fact, the price tends to be higher than the friendly level, if you can not distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap bargain, this kind of "entry-level" shooting is industrial waste.
它们强度很低，球队在球场上面振动非常大，球队高手都很难驾驭。	Their strength was very low, shaking violently, the ball was unstoppable, even the best players found it difficult to control.
你们不可以拍议它们，因为它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。	You can't afford to buy them off, because their logic and slang is too hard for you to understand. Even if you buy expensive things, you won't learn. So you'll just have to buy them off cheaply and they'll never be done with you. This way, you can make it an inexpensive hobby and you won't get too frustrated.
你真正正在进步，你可以再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。	When you can distinguish good from bad, it means you have made progress. Come back and buy expensive things here, and I'll make two times the money.
建议找一个订单吧，拍卖拍拍吧，拍卖拍卖吧，拍卖拍卖吧，拍卖拍卖吧，拍卖拍卖吧，拍卖拍卖吧，拍卖拍卖吧。	Suggestion: Buy a used camera, such as a Prince or Dynax, since these brands have no prestige and are thus reasonably priced. Used cameras for 500-600 yuan are good enough, while 200 yuan used cameras are worth the enjoyment.
新手挺友好，但一过了新手阶段就鸡肋了，但大部分人，特别是女生，过不了新手阶段。	Friendly to newcomers, but once past the beginner's stage, it's too late for most people, especially women.
订单已多次延迟，订单已多次延迟送货时间。	The order has been delayed multiple times, resulting in multiple delays in delivery.

在华盛顿五月二十三日电（记者徐剑梅），美国130多个亚裔团体向教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议三所常春藤名校——Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。
在华盛顿召开新闻发布会，亚裔教育联盟正式启动了申诉行动。	The Alliance for Equal Education held a news conference in Washington D.C. to officially launch the lawsuit.
在发布会上，几乎没有人不在，许多名校都在各方面吸收各种各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的各样的�
多种研究表明，在“招生排名”过程中，“长期持续性”和“系统化地歧视”很可能会导致亚裔人士被排外面。	Many studies have shown that in the college admissions process, "long-term consistency" and "systematic bias" against Asian applicants are likely to occur.
According to Zhao Yuxuan, the research conducted by the 2014 Stanford team showed that the Asian-American applicant rate was the lowest among all racial groups at the three universities.
据统计，在全国大学校区中，达特茅斯学院和布朗大学对亚裔学生的录取率最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达20年以上。	According to statistics, in the past 20 years, Dartmouth and Brown have had the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League universities.
许多华人在美国教育部和司法部正在办议，希望能够在认定事实后采取措施，以阻止在招生中歧视亚裔。	Many Chinese Americans are actively working with the U.S. Education and Justice Departments to take action against discrimination in college admissions after the facts are established.

在浙江省余姚丈亭镇，陆先生让探访一家厂房，在多次现场访访后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。	In the town of Yunyang, Zhejiang Province, Mr. Liu went to explore a factory building and eventually decided to buy it.
在同年12月，宋先生卖房屋，并在私人备档中存档了房屋所有权人林某的细节。	In December, Mr. Song transferred the money to the bank and signed a contract with the buyer.
林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”	When signing as the collector on the "China Factory Buy and Sell Agreement" form, Lin Xiaohu wrote, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties must sign the contract within one week."
然而，双方未能达成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。	However, they were unable to reach an agreement, leading to a delay in signing the contract.
几天后，林某退回了陆先生20万元定金。	After several days, Lin returned the 20 million yuan deposit to Liu.
房屋很难看中，但它已经准备好了，但卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。	It was difficult to see the house in the middle of the road, but it had already been prepared, but the seller refused to sell, which made Liu Xinsheng feel helpless and angry.
To this, Liu Xinsheng brought a lawsuit against Lin Yuan in the People's Court of Yunmeng City.
法院认为，双方无法签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。	The court held that since the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, neither party could solely be held responsible, and it was reasonable to determine that the other party had breached the contract. Therefore, the case should not apply to a fine and penalty. The defendant was not required to assume the double liability of breach of contract.
After the initial hearing, the plaintiff appealed to the higher court.
近日，审判正在维持原判。	Recently, the appeals court has maintained the original verdict.
律师提醒：在交易过程中，要尽到必要的审慎注意义务。	Attorneys' reminder: In the transaction process, you must exercise caution and be mindful of your duties.
在签订合同时，买方应当准备审慎地核实房屋所有权人信息、房屋是否被人占用等相关信息，并在合同中明确地确定交付的具体时间、地点，以防止双方产生争议。	When signing the contract, the buyer should carefully verify the seller's information, such as the ownership of the property, whether the property has been occupied by people, and specify the exact time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent any disputes.

教育思考：大学考试如何让“学霸 ”“ 学渣”各得其所有？	Education thoughts: How to let "academic excellence" and "academic mediocrity" get their own share in university entrance exams?
在朋友圈，兰州交通大学3名学生向校长写信，反映他们对大学考试的困惑，并提出提高考试难度，变换考试题型，让考试真正体现学生实际水平的诉求。	In the friend circle, three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the dean, expressing their frustration with the difficulty of the exams and suggesting that the exams be made more challenging, the topics be varied, and that the exams truly reflect the students' actual abilities.
准确，大学考试已经成为了很多人的“热门话题”。	It has been a hot topic for a long time.
在大学校园，学生来自五湖四海，能力水平各不同，再加之学习程度不一，学习的情况各不同。	At the university campus, students from the five lakes and four seas have different abilities, learning levels, and backgrounds, but the learning situation is varied.
对于群体具有多元性的评估，存在不同的感受，需要具备各种朋友圈。	For groups with such diversity, there are different feelings, requiring different skills and abilities.
然而，如果考试试题很简单，题目多一样，必然会造成另一种不同的感受。	However, if the test is too simple with too many similar questions, it will create a different feeling.
准备好的学生，可以准备好的考试，如果想做其他办法，可以准备好的做法吧。	Students who are not hardworking may be able to achieve good results by focusing on the exam before the last minute.
在这种情况下，学渣不投入也能过关、甚至得了高分；学霸不落课，作业、笔记样样好，考试也没高出多少的怪现象。	In such a situation, dullness can be overcome by putting in minimal effort; excellence can be achieved by putting in minimal effort, such as studying, doing homework, and taking notes.
据某些许多学生的讲解，兰州交大的考试中存在的问题并非毫无来由，相信这种状况也不只在兰州交大存在。	According to some students' accounts, the problem of examinations existing in Lanzhou University is not limited to the university.
From this perspective, three students deserve a pat on the shoulder for writing a great essay.
In reality, many people have become aware of the fact that students have been trying to "cheat" the exam by various means, such as seeking "special assistance" from teachers and trying to expand the scope of the exam in advance, even during the examination.
在教师的观点下，教学质量评估可以做到几乎完全，但是它不能够滩柜性让人感觉不准备。	From the teacher's perspective, evaluation of teaching quality can be almost complete, but it cannot make people feel prepared enough.
在大学启讯阶段，专业各种分析，很多专业课程主要讲的是基础知识。	In the beginning of college, specialization begins to divide the major courses, with the basics of knowledge as the main focus.
无论你是学生还是各种考试，都需要掌握一个基本的知识点，即使你不是一个专业人员。	No matter if you are a student or taking any kind of test, you need to grasp a basic knowledge point, which is the same for both students and professionals.
本科知识基本上是学科基础理论和基本常识，变化的空间并不大，基本上固定。	The basic knowledge of a college student is mainly composed of scientific theories and basic common sense. The space of change is not large, and it is essentially fixed.
它不像有教师所言，但它还是重点。	It is not what the teacher said, but it is still a focus.
即使知识点基本不变，试题也可能会有些不同，不代表试题重复。	Although the basic knowledge points remain the same, the questions may vary and it does not necessarily mean that the test is repetitive.
在大学考试中，一般都会组成出题组，再由专业讲师统筹组成试卷，考试阅卷由承担该科的全体老师参与，这样就能克服试题重复。	In university exams, a common practice is to form topic groups and have the questions collated by subject-experienced teachers, with the exam papers then checked by the entire department of the relevant subject. This helps to reduce the risk of exam questions being repeated.
准备一套符合教育与实践的试题，题目应该根据学生学习整体情况，并且需要合理分析学生学习程度，从而使考试具有正态、难易、题型有动态把握，同时能够突出基本知识讨论，又能兼顾学生能力评测，同时对题型进行创新设计。
考试是大学教育的指挥棒，有什么样的考试，学生就会有相应的备考方案，长此以往，将影响大学教育的成效。	Exams are the commanding rod of university education, and what kind of exams students take will determine the corresponding preparation strategies they adopt. This will in turn affect the effectiveness of university education.
兰州大学校方强调了学生建议信的重要性，并开展了整改方案。	The university has emphasized the importance of student advice messages and implemented a reform plan.
各教学单位应设置教师开展研讨和课程结读考试对照自查，制定考试试卷命题及相关制度，同时加强对考试试卷命题及审核环节的监督与检查，细化成绩评定，加强课程教学各环节的全面考核。	The school should organize teachers to conduct research and evaluation of courses and exams, formulate test questions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of the test process, and refine the grading criteria.
在大学考试中，题型单一、重复问题不可遗忘，但教师应对教学情况全面掌握，不单吃透教学内容，还需要吃透学生学习情况，两头吃透，形成良性互动，让“学霸”和“学渣”各得其所。	In university exams, the problem of single-type questions and repeated topics cannot be ignored, but teachers must comprehensively understand the learning situation and address it, not just focusing on the content but also on the students' learning. This will create a positive interaction between the teacher and the student, and the exam will be more in line with the actual situation, thus allowing for a better "study-fight" atmosphere.

11月12日，《杀戮机器》微纪录片在油管平台上宣传，引起广泛关注。	On December 11, the short film "Kill Switch" on the oil platform caused widespread attention.
该片讲述了美国以“反恐”为名发动阿富汗战争，通过战争强行输出美式民主，20年穷兵黩武、嗜血成性、滥杀无辜，犯下种种反人类罪行。	The movie depicts the United States' "anti-terror" campaign in Afghanistan, which was driven by revenge, lust for power, and unscrupulous acts of violence.
利用无人机攻击医院、学校等公共场所，依靠杀人小组扭曲人性，成立杀人小组。	Using drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other public places, relying on a murderous gang to manipulate human nature, and establishing a murderous gang.
在20多年，美军在阿富汗杀害了数万无辜民众。	In 20 years, the U.S. military has killed millions of Afghan civilians.
美军设“黑狱”，对“嫌犯”施加罪恶性的刑罚，包括它们的人身羞辱。	The U.S. military has established a "black site" prison, where "enemies" are subjected to cruel and humiliating punishments.
阿富汗人对某些人类罪行有更多仇恨。	The atrocities committed by humans have further enraged the people of Afghanistan.
正如说，美式“反恐”战争“越反越恐 ”。	As the video said, the American "anti-fear" war became more and more terrifying.
战争没有给阿富汗人民带去和平民主、繁荣希望，带去的只有滩滩的国家和无数的杀戮破坏。	Conflict has not brought peace, prosperity and hope to Afghanistan, but only destruction and suffering.

为什么客户想要保税区里面的物流公司帮做罐装？ 为什么这里朋友们可以解释这一点？
我去很多奶粉厂家，感觉很多奶粉生产线。	I visited many milk powder factories, feeling many milk powder production lines.
实际上，吃奶粉和听声明的原材料都是一样的，无论何种吃奶粉方式。	In reality, the ingredients of the powder and the liquid are the same, regardless of the type of drink.
那么大家肯定会问：为什么听装的保质期是两年，而袋装的保质期是一年？	Why is the warranty period of a bag shorter than that of a hearing aid?
或者又问：为什么听装袋装的价格差异那么大呢？	Why is the price difference between wearing and carrying so large?
妈妈级认为原材料不一样可能会造成差质，因此它们很多消费者都不可不关心。	Mothers' Day shoppers were concerned about the quality, as the materials were different from what they were used to.
原来，它们只是认为贵的东西，但是它们认为这些东西很好。	In reality, the materials were the same, but they thought that what was expensive was good.
消费者们吃了后反应不一样，吃了后面的口感或味道也不一样！	Consumers reacted differently after tasting the same product, with some commenting on the aftertaste and others noting the unique flavor.
现在我们可以听装贵的原因，贵在哪里？	Now we can discuss the reason why we need to listen carefully, where is it?
原来，它们的原材料不同吗？ 然而，它们的价格差很大。	Why are their prices so different?
因为厂家在定价时面临困难，它们可能会采取几种方式来减少成本，例如，减少厂家的费用，减少厂家的货物费，减少厂家的货物量，减少厂家的货物费用，减少厂家的货物费用比例，以及减少厂家的货物费用费用。	Manufacturers may reduce their costs by reducing their expenses, such as reducing the cost of raw materials, reducing the amount of goods they produce, reducing the cost of transportation, and reducing the ratio of goods to transportation costs.
因此他们在听装的价格上，有了一个很大的上升幅度来保障他们的利润空间。	Therefore, they had a great advantage in terms of pricing and were able to secure a large profit margin.
它们认为袋装不是厂家主推的最佳选择，而听装是。	Most manufacturers prefer to have their products heard rather than packaged.
你们可以听到很多厂家的广告，但你们不能听到很多厂家的议论，因为它们不可以让它们的费用显示出来。	You can hear many ads from different factories, but you can't hear many discussions about their fees, because they can't show their fees out loud.
Everyone can imagine it.
市场的推广费用，比如说：商场的促销人员、商场的陈列费用、产品的赠品费用、广告费用等，都在不断的增加。	The cost of marketing is constantly increasing, such as the fees for store promoters, store rental fees, product samples, and advertising fees.
因此，各个厂家正在不断地发布新产品，但价格并不断地上涨，实际上这是由市场费用的增加而出的新产品。	New products are constantly being released by different factories due to the increasing cost of production, and the prices are constantly rising.
几乎是在同时，他们希望在某些情况下可以减少成本，但几乎是在同时，几乎是在同时，他们希望在某些情况下可以减少成本。	In reality, their cost of materials may increase by no more than 3-4 yuan.
医院医生协助产品推广，从一听里面抽成30元到80元不等的利润。	Hospitals have been enlisted to help promote products, with some earning up to $80 for each referral from a hearing.
中国的相关法律不允许这样的行为，它正在坑害消费者。	In fact, such practices are prohibited by Chinese law.
建议孩子们在家里有罐的前提下买袋装的奶粉装入罐中，这样可以节省费用，而增加奶粉的保存性和密封性。	It is suggested to store milk powder in a can at home, taking the precaution of having a can of milk powder before buying a can of milk powder, which can save money, increase the sealing and preserving effect, and have no impact on children.
听装的保质期比袋装长，但袋装可以保存在开包后，听装不可以。	The durability of a garment is not necessarily better if it is packaged in a garment bag rather than a garment box. The garment bag is easier to be damaged by humidity and temperature changes.
它们吃了凉了，凉了后又干又硬，无法吃。	They ate cold food, which was both dry and hard. There was no way they could eat it.
汤汁还洒了出来，但是它们却不能够滩柜。	The soup was still dirty, but it couldn't be put in the cupboard.
立即取消，他 #PRS_ORG# 补送来的东西肯定都凉了。	He definitely cooled off the stuff he got from #PRS_ORG#.
I didn't get it!
#NAME# 说你们没有人去拿吧。	They said you didn't have anyone to go get it.
We have already made the call.
If you don't pay up, I'll call the police.
After trying #PRS_ORG# several times, today's experience was the worst.
You must accept completely.
很好，可以吧。	That's great, let's go!
但也要提醒餐厅及骑手，不可以停止吧。	But also remind the restaurant and the driver.
Prevent it from happening again.
I want to know the exact time for dinner.
That time kept on postponing.
I don't know when it will be ready.
如果您取消订单，您可以退回钱款。	If you cancel the order, you can get a refund.
想向骑手支付服务费，怎么给？	How do I pay for the service fee to the rider?
在几个小时内，确认了一名骑手。	In a few hours, it was confirmed that there was a rider.
I'm not willing to wait any longer.
Don't be fooled by the bait of the starting line - Xinhua Net
在订阅书籍时，易让感受到历史性的订阅书籍。	When subscribing to books, you may often feel the explosive energy of successful books.
今日的成功人物都做了“最好原则”，它允许了他们暗示自己可以“做到”，然后再告诉他们需要做到的事情“是什么”。	Today's successful people have all done the "best practices" - allowing them to hint that they can "do it" and then tell them what needs to be done.
几乎是在同时，斯坦福医学院的生物化学教授Patrick Brown，对一种被称作"基因地图"的技术产生了很大兴趣。	Around the same time, Patrick Brown, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine, became interested in developing new techniques for mapping genes.
因此，这些书都有一个共同的特点——要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。	Thus, these books all have a common trait — either they make you want to work hard and become the best, or they make you want to give up and do nothing; either they make you want to climb Mount Tai, or they make you want to stay still.
这种“最好原则”，让谁看都会承认“正确无比”，但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。	This "best practice" will make everyone admit that it is "incorrectly superior" but it will still trick 99% of people into falling for it before the starting line.
因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。	Because this kind of thinking is a path to a "you must suffer to succeed, rebuild yourself into a new 180-degree turnaround," it is a fatal weakness for many people.
对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ”，无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。	For those who resist change, you must constantly remind them that they must transform, which is clearly an act of self-deception and exploitation.
人们都会在“变革”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“变革”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。	Most people will be hesitant before the change, with their feet dragging and their heart wavering; or they may be energized by a short-lived surge of emotion, but eventually they will fall into the same trap, unable to sustain the momentum.
马三立先生那段《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传播神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。	The iconic performance of "The Universal Human" in the film "From Tomorrow" was a classic masterpiece of Ma Sanli.
The greatest challenge of the "Golden Rule" is that it often exceeds the capacity of the average person, leaving most people feeling helpless and frustrated.
或许，“准备好”可以让更多普通人让自己走上相对成功之路。	Perhaps, "preparedness" is the path to success that more people can walk.
它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行。	This core principle is based on the idea of "reducing friction" — — it encourages a "little wins lead to big wins" mentality, where even if you don't reach 100%, just doing 1% more is still better than doing nothing at all.
无论你做了什么，你都可以强。	No matter what you do, you can be strong.
因为门槛许多减少，因此可以做到坚持的可能性增多了，凡事只要坚持，可以达成很多事情。	Since the difficulty of the task has been reduced, the probability of success has also increased significantly.
做事不错不过要遵循“准确步”，这样可以长许多几年。	Success comes from following the "do it right" principle, but it takes time.
Although "the best practice" is often seen as a successful flag that can motivate everyone, in reality it is only effective in motivating a few; whereas "the second best practice" can effectively motivate more people, allowing them to benefit as much as possible.

如果想在这一行业进行入驻，可以选择去找培训，但如果没有这种想法，那么自学很好，因为培训费用很多，而且还要花6个月的时间去学习。	If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find training, but if you don't have this kind of thought, then self-study is also good, because the cost of training is too much, and it also takes 6 months of time to study.
但如果你正在探索这一行业，那么培训很可能是你的最好选择，尤其是你正在探索自己的力量。	But if you're looking to break into this industry, training is a great choice, especially if you're exploring your own strengths.
自学可以强烈，但是会比较累。	If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to study on your own, but it will be quite tiring.
选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的，因为它可以帮助你吸取很多知识。	Choosing a good training institution is very important, as it can help you absorb a lot of knowledge.
首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。	First, you need to look at the teacher's qualifications and strength. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions also have relatively weak teacher qualifications.
找到培训机构可以很强大的学生，但是培训机构的学生不可知道培训机构的内容，讲解的课程是好或者不好。	Finding a training institution with excellent students is great, but the students may not know the content of the training institution, so it is difficult to judge the quality of the courses.
你好，我也不知道怎么回答你问题，因为我没有做到你自身情况介绍，也没有学习这个东西。	Hello, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't given you enough information about my own situation.
例如，专业、年龄、语言等，它们可以与你学习或者想要从事相关的行业有关。	For example, profession, age, language, etc., they can be related to the industry you are studying or wanting to engage in.
如果你是学生，或是计算机专业的毕业生，那么如果你有时间充许，我个人建议你可以自学，这个是最低的成本和效率的，但是一学习需要很长时间，投入的时间比较多，并且需要培训3-6个月。	If you are a student or a computer professional with a degree, then if you have the time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most cost-efficient and effective way, but it requires a long time investment, with a high cost and a lot of time commitment for training.
但是，如果你不能自学，网络上面各种学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站访问各种培训资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询我，我可以帮助你。	But if you can't self-study, there are many free learning resources online, such as those on the B station, or you can contact me for free resources.
另外，还可以结合视频综合学习，比如《朋友圈》，《论坛》等论坛论坛。	In addition, you can also combine video-based learning with classic books, such as "The Circle" and "Forum".
如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。	If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay some learning costs, such as tuition fees and time, then it is advisable to attend a training institution to learn, as the learning is not too tiring and the teachers explain in great detail with help available for any questions.
几乎不可思议，现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。	It's remarkable how many training institutions nowadays sign job contracts, provide references, and recommend companies after the training, thus saving a lot of time during the job hunting process.
I'm just giving you a general overview of my views, as I didn't understand your situation fully. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.

中沙策展人协助举办沙特首届现代艺术双年展-新华网	Chinese curators helped organize the first-ever Shaanxi Contemporary Art Biennale - New China Net.
王海洲访迪里耶，访问艺术双年展，让人感受它们的各种各样的艺术。	Wang Haizhou visited Dili, experiencing the art of the Dili Double-Year Exhibition.
本次双年展由沙特迪里耶双年展基金会和中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心联合策划，中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心馆长田霏宇担任艺术总监。	The exhibition was jointly planned by the Shenzhen Duolun Museum of Contemporary Art and the UCCA Duneau Contemporary Art Center, with Tian Yuan as the curator.
在展开展团队介绍，本次双年展主题为“摸着石头过河”，隐含了社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当前状态。	The team introduced the theme of the exhibition, "Feeling Stones Over the River", which reflects the reform strategies adopted in the current period of social and economic transformation in Saudi Arabia and its cultural development.
This exhibition spans over 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings showcasing : "Touching Stones Across the River", "Inheriting the Experiment", "Exploring the Boundaries", "Walking Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "Discussing the Spirit of Art".
在展中，27位沙特艺术家的作品占总量的40%以上，包括囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品受到大量关注，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图》（2014）中，使用回收材料创作了一幅经典山水画。
许多国际朋友吸引欧洲文化，希望双年展能够推动朋友们的交流，帮助各国人民更好地了解各国文化，加强互动往来。	Many international friends are attracted to the European culture, and they hope the Double Exhibition can promote the exchange and interaction between friends, and help people from different countries to understand each other's culture better, thus enhancing the interaction in the future.
田霏宇说，双年展目标是双重，具体是让沙特当代艺术与全球对话，同时也让艺术品让沙特观众融入当代艺术世界。	Tian Fei Yu said, "The goal of the biennale is double-fold, to allow for a dialogue between contemporary art from Saudi Arabia and the global art world, as well as to allow for a deeper engagement of the audience with contemporary art from Saudi Arabia."
在双年展开幕周期间，还将举办系列讲座，艺术家、策展人和创意行业的意见领袖将就跨文化交流、当代艺术发展等主题展开讨论。	During the Double Ninth Festival period, there will be a series of lectures, with art experts, curators, and creative industry leaders discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

云南省政府启动了统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理，让乡村公益岗位更加正确规范。	The People's Government of Yunnan Province has launched a system to standardize and regulate village-level public interest positions, making them more accurate and standardized.
新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。
云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。	The introduction of the person in charge of the rural work unit in Yunnan Province, who is responsible for developing 44.83 million public-benefit jobs in rural areas, has played an important role in helping the impoverished population achieve employment growth, improve the resilience of poverty alleviation, and enhance the public service capabilities in various aspects.
云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发《新规》，让基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面统一规范。	The State Council, together with the departments of Human Resources, Finance, Agriculture, Rural Affairs, and Civil Affairs, jointly issued the "New Rules" to unify the regulations on recruiting, managing, and developing positions for rural villagers in the public sector.
在设置工作岗位方面，新规定确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制”原则进行设置。	In setting up work positions, the new regulations are clear, adhering to the principles of "one person one job, voluntary openness, and unified management".
招聘程序包括公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤。	The recruitment process involves posting, application, screening, interviewing, hiring, and onboarding.
In addition, the new regulation also clearly defined the specific responsibilities, subsidies and methods of village-level positions in the village-level public service department, and stipulated that the village-level public service department should purchase accident insurance for the village-level public service personnel in a timely manner.

二、尽管右派在历史上有短存，但它们却够在它们的时代内存在几十年，因此它们却够在它们的时代内存在几十年。	Two, although the Right-wing had a short-lived heyday in history, it was still able to last for several decades, thus making it last longer than expected.
尽管社会进步过程中右派却存在，但它们却帮助了很多人。	Although the right-wing has had a negative impact on society, it has also had some positive effects.
右派党的勇敢努力在建设社会主义的基础上，正在准备各种各样的努力，正在准备各种各样的努力，正在准备各种各样的努力。	Right-wing parties have been tirelessly working to promote the development of the economy, technology, and political reforms, as well as to protect human rights.
三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人。	In terms of myself, although I don't agree with everything Li Weidong said, I'm very interested in his views, and I highly respect him for being sincere, for being sincere about China, and for being sincere about China's social issues.
我不同意他对共产党的反思论，认为反对它无论它是正在进行哪一项活动，都会导致社会不平静，民生受损，政治团体受到损害。	I disagree with his anti-communist views, as I believe any anti-communist movement will inevitably lead to social unrest, economic hardship and political disorder.
四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。	Changing or improving China requires a heartfelt and responsible attitude, not a political gambit of playing with fire. It is not right-wing, but a mishmash.
Let's chat some more.
In reality, it was a relic of the past and politics.
如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，那么左就没有它所扔掉的糟粕，因为左听取了右的言论和分析了他们的思想。	If right-wing ideas have positive social implications, the left will listen to them and analyze their thoughts when needed. Without the right-wing ideas to criticize, the left has nothing to counteract.
五、我们吧，别忘了，别急急，别感染了。	Five, let's not forget, don't forget, don't get too excited, don't get infected.
Don't try to reason with a Han Chinese or a Leftist, they're both made of the same stuff - stubbornness.
不要做假，不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？	Don't try to prove we're right, don't think about making us admit to it, why bother?
When my friends tease you for five minutes, when your left foot is itchy and your right dog is barking, it proves that our middle road is correct!
很多人在少年时期准备好了做事，但当老了时，却忘了准备，或许准备好了做事，但却沦为偏执。	Many people had their dreams and ambitions when they were young, but as they got older, they forgot them or chased after the wrong things.
朋友们听说，它可以很长时间吧，它可以很长时间吧，它可以很长时间吧。	Friends said it could take a long time, it could take a long time, it could take a long time.
左右，我觉得中国人应该偏左。	Left or right, I think China should be left-leaning due to its history and cultural genes.
在国内右派关注效率和发展，左派则关注监管、公平以及安全。	In China, the right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing focuses on regulation, fairness, and security.
在这个社会中，人们正在重新订阅公平，同时外面正在冲突，偏左很可能会持续多久。	In this society, people are reassessing fairness, while there is conflict outside, the left-leaning tendencies are likely to continue for a long time.
Although he couldn't understand a word, he still clapped at the end.
花花不可思议，它们却可以做到仗义。	The flowers were amazing, yet they were able to do justice.
近两年，美帝对华为芯片的封锁和围堵，不仅让华为陷入前所未有的困境，也让“美系”企业遭遇巨大的损失。	Over the past two years, the U.S. embargo against Huawei chips has not only put the company in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused immense losses to "American-style" businesses.
美国政府强制压制中国芯片产业，要求自家企业及盟友国相关企业同时对我国芯片产业进行封锁，导致全球芯片供应商的订单和利润受到影响，造成芯片生产企业的研发投入降低、产能下降，从而造成了全球范围内芯片供应链的短缺的紊乱。
某些行业，比如车企停产、手机涨价，几乎所有用到芯片的行业都深受“缺芯”害。	Certain industries, such as car manufacturing and mobile phone pricing, have been severely impacted by the shortage of chips.
为了掌握“芯片”自主权，越来越多国家正在许可“去美化”，它们正在准备各种技术掌握。	In order to gain control of the "chip" technology, more and more countries are embarking on the road to "Westernization" by allowing various technologies to be developed.
为了牢牢把控全球半导体控制权，牵制中国半导体行业的发展，最近老美动作频频，又是主持“芯片峰会”；又是邀请64国巨头成立半导体联盟，并拔款扶持美国本土科技巨头，比如，美帝老牌科技巨头英特尔为了夺回在芯片领域的主导地位，斥资200亿美元在美国亚利桑那州建2座晶圆加工厂，并对外开放芯片代工业务。	Recently, the US has been actively pushing for its own chip industry by inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and offering subsidies to
大多数人认为，英特尔此番举动将对台积电造成一定冲击，并可能会够够借鉴台积电的“饭碗”。	Most people believe that the move by Intel to unveil its own discrete GPU will cause a certain amount of disruption to the Taiwanese DRAM market, and may be able to borrow some of its "dish" from it.
因为英特尔为美帝老牌科技巨头，半导体领域深耕几十年，拥有大量的人才队伍和技术储备，必定能在短期内迅速崛起，打败台积电。	Because of its long history in the semiconductor industry and its vast pool of talent and technology reserves, Intel must have been able to quickly rise and defeat Taiwan in a short period of time.
然而，英特尔的决定却无法决定了张忠谋不屑一顾。	However, the decision of Intel did not affect Zhang Chung-Mao.
在2021年4月举办的“大师智库论坛”上，张忠谋的话它吸引了各界，它对英特尔斥资建晶圆厂这个举动它毫无顾忌直言，许多人不懂地讨论。	At the 2021 Teacher's Cup Forum, Zhang Chongtu's blunt speech about the factory built by Intel and Foxconn caused a stir, with many people openly discussing the issue.
张忠谋因为30多年前在英特尔挖掘电力与晶圆领域，依然感到不屑。	Zhang Chung-Mao's determination to invade the chip market was fueled by his long-standing grudge against Intel.
英特尔在1960年代开始制造领域的霸主，并在全球巅峰上居住。	Intel has been the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry since the 1960s, and has been residing at the pinnacle of the global market ever since.
在1980年代，几乎只有少数强者掌握半导体高端芯片。	In the 1980s, only a few powerful entities were able to grasp the advanced semiconductor chips.
当时，半导体行业的特征在于IDM模式，制造、装配和封装都由一家工厂完成，英特尔代表了该时代。	At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with design, manufacturing, assembly and packaging all completed by a single factory, with Intel representing that era.
但这样的模式会给一些小型企业造成不宜负责，多少微型半导体创业者面对巨额的产业线建设费用只能感受而无法付出。	Although this model may be beneficial to some large-scale businesses, it can be costly for small-scale businesses, leaving them with a heavy burden to bear.
在市场需求的感召下，进入80年代后，芯片行业开始出现分工合作的现象，1984年张忠谋听说有专门做芯片设计的公司，便认为既然有专门做设计的，那么就可以成立一家专门用于晶圆制造的工厂。	In response to the growing demand for chips, the chip industry began to appear in the 80s, and the phenomenon of collaborative division of labor was heard. Zhang Chung-Mao heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought it was feasible to establish a factory specializing in chip manufacturing.
几乎半年后，张忠谋的想法成为现实，在台极电力运输中正在生。	In a few years, Zhang Chuangmu's idea became a reality, with Taiwan becoming a leader in the development of renewable energy.
在晶圆加工业务上，台积电把拒绝了设计，只提供晶圆制造的代工服务。	In the jewelry-making business, Tai Chin Electric provides only custom-made jewelry services without design.
英特尔在这个巨无霸面前就是小喽啰，刚创立的台积电。	When Intel was established, it was a small company in front of the giant giant.
为了让资本携手，张忠谋很忙找到英特尔投资，但英特尔听到许多台积电只是制造芯片行业的制造环节，显然有些自视高，让许多人不懂，英特尔拒绝投资台积电。	In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chung-Mao had been actively seeking investment from Intel, but Intel was reluctant to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor due to its limited understanding of the chip industry's manufacturing ecosystem. Intel thought it was too risky and declined to invest.
张忠谋认定英特尔在晶圆制程服务时正在看不起。	Zhang Chung-Ming also acknowledged that Intel was not paying attention to the glass-making process at the time.
几乎无法想象，今日却正在制作晶圆代工。	Imagine that - today, you're making glass spheres!
因此，张忠谋感到很困难，英特尔正在进入晶圆的代工。	So, Zhang Chungu felt very humiliated, as if he was being tricked by the sly Englishman.
今日，英特尔市值已经超过了台积电。	Now, the value of Intel has exceeded that of Taiwan Semiconductor.
英特尔自然总是敢不可敢地面对强势进攻，无论台积电还是其它阶段。	Regardless of whether it's facing strong offensive from Taiwan or other stages, Intel Natural is always bold and resolute.
现在，台积电已经向着3nm芯片冲刺，而英特尔正在研发14nm芯片。	Now, TSMC has already moved on to 3nm chips, while Intel is still developing 14nm chips.
想要让假吧并非易事。	Wanting to fool around is not easy.

今天来看一些【奇怪的热搜】，它们可以帮助你在搜索中准备好些关键字。	Come and take a look at some of the [weird] hot searches today, they can help you prepare some key words for your search.
What is normal emotional behavior?
在某些情况下，如果有一个人感到激励，他可以向朋友们发布一个挑选文章，这样可以帮助他们扩散感情，然后由此产生一个潜在的波峰，但是这种情况下，如果有人发现这种情况，他可以通过指数下降（平滑曲线）来消散潜在的波峰。	If certain conditions are met, a person feeling excited can post a poll to his friends, which can help spread the emotion and create a potential wave, but if someone notices this situation, they can use a declining index (a smooth curve) to dissipate the potential wave.

图9中，一个事件的热度波峰恰好是另一事件的波谷，时间分秒不差，必定是统一批水军接到任务，开启新一轮攻势。	In the graph, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another, at the same time and with no difference in seconds. It is certain that the united forces will accept the new mission and launch a new offensive.
黑客的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。	You can see the professionalization of black hat activities is visible in the rise of several dozen hot topics on the same list, such as which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for profits, which ones are sparking offensive and defensive strategies, which
传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑客也会无处遁形。	The spread of science involves opening up new frontiers, unleashing emotions and appealing to all kinds of data, even black hat hackers will be affected.

我们朋友朋友介绍，因为信任，我们选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。	We trusted our friends and chose to look into our basic budget for $7,000.
在店里，他们就开始一系列的骗术。	In the store, they began a series of scams.
我正在搜索房子，但是我很惊讶，一个假屋卖人给我看了我的户型图，然后卖人均勤地给我报价，我的房子7万可以搞定。	I was searching for a house, but I was surprised when a real estate agent showed me the floor plan of my house without even going to the site. They quoted me the price without knowing what brand of materials they were.
他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。	Their second scam is that they will entice you to come to the store with the promise of a discount, but once you're there they will try to extort money from you.
当你正在犹豫要不要交定金时，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。	When you are negotiating the price of a car in Uyuni, they will invite their manager to tell you that you will get a discount if you agree to pay the price.
这个是一个大坑，我就是一个被骗的例子，在头脑冲动时我交了一万多的财金。	This is an example of a scam, where I lost a million dollars in the heat of the moment.
他给我的报价有很多问题，不包括任何门和橱柜，浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用。	He gave me a quote with many problems, excluding water and electricity renovation, excluding any doors and closets, and these three are the cost of the foundation.
除去这些他们的服务点费收，还比其他家公司的高。	By removing these fees, they are still higher than other companies' fees.
我们不可能对这个公司让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让它们让我们让��
当我们去找他们退钱时，他们显示出很多经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付我们。	When we went to ask them to resign, they displayed a very experienced attitude, with a specialized team to face us.
无论如何都会一口咬死，客户无论何处都无法采取责任。	No matter how it happens, it's the customer's problem and they can't take responsibility no matter where they are.
朋友找各种费用，不想一一算各种费用，后期给你算各种费用。	Your friends found various fees, didn't want to calculate them all, and later gave you an estimate of the costs.
坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。	The dragon heads were originally used to deceive people, but now they have been replaced with American-style dragons, as if they have been shut down again.
因此，请不要选择那种坑爹的装修公司。	Therefore, please don't choose such a shoddy construction company.

北京市天文爱好者在青海拍摄的双子座流星雨，2018年12月13日。	A double rainbow was spotted in the sky by amateur astronomers in Beijing on December 13, 2018.
大部分流星雨的母天体都是周期彗星，但双子座流星雨的母天体却是3200号小行星法厄同，这是一颗阿波罗型小行星。	Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the meteor shower associated with the rain of stars is the 3200-numbered asteroid Honda-Tsubaki, a rare type of asteroid called a "Honda-Tsubaki-type asteroid".
在现在已知的二个流星雨中，双子座流星雨也不是由彗星“孕育”。	In the known two meteor showers, the Zeta Reticuli shower is not from a Zeta Reticuli star system.
受采的星雨在岁末期间可以在12月4日到17日上映，“档期”可以从12月4日到17日持续。	The "upcoming shower" of star rain will be visible from December 4th to 17th.
流星雨在北半球三大流星雨中扩充，它们被称为象限仪流星雨、英仙座流星雨。	The three great rainbows in the Northern Hemisphere are the Northern Lights, the Milky Way, and the Zodiacal Light.
在双子座流星雨中，一个显著特点是流星体速度较慢，色彩丰富，火流星也不少，既适合目视，也适合天文摄影的初学者进行拍摄。	In the Double Star Rain, one of the most prominent features is the slow speed of the meteoroids, the vivid colors, and the abundance of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginner photographers.
在天津市杨婧2020年12月13日下雨，拍摄的双子座流星雨让人惊吧。	On December 13th, 2020, Yang Jing in Tianjin City, China, captured a double rainbow with a starry background.
它显示，今年的双子座流星雨将于12月14日15时左右迎来极大，极大时ZHR为150。	It shows that the meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14th, 2020 at 15:00 UTC, with a ZHR of 150.
双子座流星雨推荐指数图。	The Zodiac recommends the Star-Rain Index Chart.
Last year, the "Double-Double" rainbows left a deep impression on people, but this year's rainbows will be affected by the moonlight interference, losing some of their splendor.
在农历十一月十一日，月亮会让观测者受到干扰，但是在后半夜月亮会下雨，双子座流星雨的辐射点也会升高。	On the night of November 14th, the full moon will cause some interference, but it will be followed by a rainy double-zodiac month, which will make the radiation point higher.
你可以在下雨后几个小时后它下雨的时候进行观测，但要注意防寒保暖。	You can observe the meteor shower after the rain for about three hours, but be sure to take precautions against the cold and the rain.
如何可以让我们观看更多的流星？	How can we observe more meteor showers?
在郊区或乡村可以选择一个海拔高、光害小、面向东北方向的视野开阔的地方，然后等到月亮落下后，可以让观察即可。	In rural areas or suburban areas, you can select a high, bright, and open viewpoint facing east, and wait for the moon to fall before enjoying the view.
注意的是，双子座流星雨在各方向流动非常大，在观察时不能盯着它的辐射点。	Note that the flow of the Double Star Zodiac Rain is very large in all directions, and it should not be observed continuously fixated on its radiation point.
朋友们喜欢摄影，拍摄出绚丽的“流星雨大片”，最好选择宽角、大光圆镜。	Friends who love photography want to capture the beautiful "UFO Raindrop" with a wide-angle lens and a high ISO setting.
基于稳定性和持续性考虑，三脚架、备用电池和快门线都必须不可少。	Based on stability and durability, three-legged stands, backup batteries, and quick-release cables are all essential.
The phoenix reminded him to fix it.
激光电视和传统电视在市场定位上有何差异？	What differences exist between the market positions of laser TV and traditional TV?
我们可以看到，液晶电视和激光电视在市场定位上的差异主要有以下两点：1. 液晶电视比激光电视更多权威，因此液晶电视可以在市场上排名更高，但激光电视可以在价格上更有效地排名。2. 液晶电视比激光电视更多可以滩雨，因此液晶电视在暴雨天不可用，而激光电视可以用在暴雨天上。
首先，激光电视更让大屏市场更聚焦。	First, laser TVs make the big-screen market more focused.
液晶电视已经开始推出激光显示，但激光显示仍然不能替代液晶电视，因为液晶电视本身就是为大屏而生的产物。	Compared to the fully open market position of LCD TVs, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are a product of LCD TVs.
目前，主流液晶电视尺寸在55英寸到65英寸，而激光电视尺寸在75英寸以上，最大的超过100英寸，充分滩足用户对大屏彩电的需求。	At present, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of LED TVs is usually 75 inches or above, with the maximum size exceeding 100 inches, meeting the needs of users for large-screen televisions.
近年来，激光电视在全球的出货量和销量占比都在不断增加，在80英寸及以上总体电视销量中占比超过六倍。	In recent years, the global shipment and sales of LED TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for over 60% of the total global TV market.
据中怡康的预测，2020年，激光电视市场销量增长将超过140%，继续保持高速增长。	According to predictions by China's Xingyun, the growth of the laser TV market in 2020 will exceed 140%, continuing its rapid growth.
因为激光电视在护眼方面的優秀表现，它在大屏市场有如此好的成绩。	The excellent performance of the laser TV in the eye protection department is the main reason for its good performance in the large-screen market.
基于激光光源的成像原理，激光光源发出的光线并不直射入眼球，相比液晶电视的背光源发光，成像过程更接近自然条件下物体的成像过程，对眼睛产生的刺激也更小。	Based on the principle of laser imaging, the laser light emitted by the laser source is not directly focused into the eye, compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
在北京协和医院眼科中，几乎是在同时，中国电子技术标准化研究院赛西实验室和北京协和医院眼科专家，通过人群相同条件下观看激光电视和液晶电视的严格对比试验，得出了144组测试数据。	In the Beijing Eye Hospital, the same experiment was conducted simultaneously by researchers from the Chinese Electronics Standardization Research Institute and Beijing Eye Hospital ophthalmologists, comparing the results of viewing laser and liquid crystal televisions under the same conditions.
准备好的激光电视可以帮助你减少朋友圈眼疾病的发作，但不能替换正常的眼镜。	Ready-to-use laser TV can help reduce the occurrence of eye diseases in your friend group, but it cannot replace a normal pair of glasses.
在视力健康越来越受重视的当下，激光电视不仅凭借护眼优势吸引了越来越多用户，也打开了彩电市场的另一个突破口。	In the face of increasing attention to eye health, laser TVs have not only benefited from the advantages of protecting eyes, but have also opened up a new breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus on the high-end market.
液晶电视价格不断下降，目前市售激光电视的价格在千元以下，随着尺寸和光源的升级，价格逐步下降。	The price of LCD TVs has been constantly dropping, currently selling at around a thousand dollars or less, as the size and light source have been upgraded, resulting in a gradual decrease in price.
激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？ 激光电视凭什
It is certain to be rational.
在光源和技术水平的不断发展下，激光电视有很多优点，比如投影无法实现的优势。	In the ever-evolving world of lighting and technology, LED TVs offer numerous advantages over projection TVs, such as improved picture quality and energy efficiency.
凭借超短焦距投影技术，激光电视的投影距离相对传统投影设备来说要更短，能够在短距离内实现100英寸大屏体验，所需空间不大，而且主机小巧，占用地方很小。	Thanks to advanced short-focus projection technology, the distance between the projector and the screen can be much shorter than that of traditional projection systems, allowing for a 100-inch large-screen experience in a small space with a small host and minimal footprint.
在亮度方面，大品牌激光电视可以达到2000以上的流明，但是它不能滩滩地播放高清视频。	In terms of brightness, branded LED TVs can reach a maximum of 2000 nits, but they cannot play high-quality videos continuously.
电视屏幕可以延续使用几乎无限期间，但电池可能会受到损害。	The TV screen can last for almost infinite time, but the battery may suffer damage.
除此外，很多高端激光电视机型还搭载了真4K超高清画质、人工智能系统、仿生屏等众多前沿技术，能够给用户带来更震撼的视听体验。	In addition to 4K ultra-high-definition visuals, many high-end laser TVs also come with advanced features such as artificial intelligence systems, immersive sound, and more. This can provide users with an even more exhilarating visual and audio experience.
不可以让假需求让人挤透，但是需求细分可以帮助产品各种形式的发展，准备好投入可以帮助产出比强，激光电视不是影音玩家的菜，想兼顾大屏和观看环境不足，可以尝试，凡事皆有利弊，权衡过后自己判断即可，就怕听信一面之词。	Don't let fake demand fool you, but dividing the demand can help product development in various forms, prepare well for investment and help strengthen the output ratio, laser TV is not a gaming console for viewers, consider the large screen and viewing environment beforehand, you can try, all things have their own advantages and disadvantages, weighing the pros and
昂贵的超广角透镜和反射镜不符合光学最佳设计，因此不可采用。	Expensive wide-angle lenses and reflectors do not conform to the best optical design, so they cannot be used.
为了防范部分环境光，使用微结构的柏兰帕布，价格高昂，80寸可以换40寸液晶。	To protect against part of the environment light, using the fabric of the Burberry, the price is high, 80 inches can be exchanged for 65 inches of liquid crystal.
另外一点，我特别不敬拒绝投影厂商拿漫反射对眼睛好这种当卖点，拜托，眼睛能够看到的幕布上的光线对于眼睛而言就是直射光，你漫反射到天花板上，眼睛也看不到，非要较真液晶电视也是漫“直射”，打开电视天花板不也被照亮吗？
然而，投影幕布如果不是漫反射，那么它无法成为像。	However, if the projection screen is not reflective, it will not become like that.
它们忽略了高增益幕布的热斑效应，直到它们见到那些光线反射到眼睛时才发现它们正在面对它们真正的难受。	They ignored the hot spot effect of the high-gain fabric until they saw the light reflecting into their eyes, then they realized the true difficulty.
摄影馆优选品质店，暂时还没有分店。	The photography store is the best choice for quality products, but it doesn't have a store yet.

在店前填妇名电话，然后选择服装，婚礼可以选择，换了三四套服装还让人感觉很耐心，选好后整齐了很久，服务态度也好，后面拍摄会教你怎么摆造型，就是拍出来的感觉脸好大，精修说是要半个月，三四天就发来了，感觉好像跟原片没啥差别。	After filling out the name and phone number, you can choose the clothes you want, the wedding and formal wear are also available, the service is patient and attentive, the feeling of the store is good, it took a long time to adjust the makeup, it looks like the original picture, the feeling is very good, it took half a month, and then sent the pictures, it looks like

【体验】原本双眼皮被贴出了三眼皮，现在可能造型有点过了。	Experience: Originally there were two contact lenses, but now there are three. It might be a bit too much.
几乎没有眉，几乎没有眉头，几乎没有眉毛，几乎没有眉发。	For those who are not used to wearing makeup, it can be a bit intimidating.
拍照十来天，但P图效果不够明显，感觉双眼皮贴吧。	Taking a picture of the sky after 10 minutes, but the P effect was not very obvious, feeling like double eyebrows were sticking out.
她说这套让人感觉很古典，但她还试了一次它的黑色版本，结果很滩柔。	She said the black version made her feel very classic, but she also tried the white version, which was much more relaxed.
我们选择了衣服后就开始弄妆发啦，妆颜色师和化妆师小姐姐都强固地帮我们弄妆发啦，我们弄出来的效果非常滩。	We started to get ready after choosing the clothes, the makeup artist and hairstylist were very patient and persistent in helping us achieve the desired result.
我们拍照的过程很轻松，摄影师均勤地指导我摆姿势。	The process of taking photos was very easy and relaxed, with the photographer directing me in a calm and smooth manner.
我们拍完后它们准备好了，小哥哥们它们最喜欢的它们选择了15内成片。	We finished and they prepared it for us. They chose the 15-inch movie they liked the most. The ending was very satisfying.
你们的系统无法识别出我的信用卡，因此我无法加入 #PRS_ORG# plus 月费计划！	Your system couldn't recognize my credit card, so I couldn't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
它无论不可思议，我每次付款都使用了同一张信用卡。	No matter how peculiar it is, I always use the same credit card for payment.
每次都要付运费，但是不同的运费不同。	I have to pay shipping fees every time, but the fees vary depending on the item.
你们可以先让我们调查完毕，再收取我的月费吧？	Can I pay my monthly fee after the investigation is done?
你可以买保险吗？你可以靠谱吗？
小雨伞是一个网上保险经纪平台，可以帮助你在网上找到几乎任何类型的保险。	Shopping for insurance online can be a hassle, but little umbrella makes it easy and convenient.
According to the regulations, to become a licensed insurance intermediary, you must meet three key words: shareholders, founders and the company's minimum capital requirement of 500,000 yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
它们不可能是正规的保险公司，因为它们不能达到国家权威部门批准、股东要有良好的作风，作为保险经纪公司的小雨伞保险，投保者是不用过多质疑，它们不能执行正规的保险业务。	They cannot be a legitimate insurance company because they cannot get the approval of the governmental authority, have good corporate culture and have a proper risk management system.
In this respect, it's not bad, it's worth trusting.	In this respect, it's not bad, it's worth trusting.
From an insurance perspective, umbrella insurance is akin to an insurance bazaar, with many companies' celebrities selling their high-risk policies here, such as the newly released and super-risky policy of Halle Berry 5, with its reinsurance and indemnity provided by the same people at Chubb. Umbrella insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there's no reason to doubt its neutrality.
从费用规则角度来看，互联网平台的产品，因为少了营业网点的经营费用，和业务员工资的成本，所以互联网产品普遍性价比比较高，而且支付方式可以自由选择，支持月费，减轻投保人的费用压力，同时可以最大限度的撬动保险的杠杆。	From a cost perspective, Internet-based products are generally more expensive than traditional products due to the lack of brick-and-mortar storefronts and associated overhead costs. However, they are more flexible with payment options, such as monthly payments, which can reduce the burden on insured parties.
This is still very impressive.
You can consider it.
From an insurance professional's perspective, this is particularly important because the insurance industry is a highly professionalized industry that requires very strong demands. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to many misconceptions in the health declaration and professional area, and insurance professionals may add their own subjective judgments when they feel healthy or meet the requirements, which may lead to a higher risk of being rejected.
我在“腾讯微保”（和小雨伞一样，也是互联网保险经纪平台）做过保险电话销售，非常负责任的告诉大家。	I have done insurance sales over the phone at "Tencent Weibo" (just like Yao Ming, it is an internet insurance platform). I am very responsible for telling you this.
网络保险正在各地正在试验，但是它不靠谱，因为它不可以由任何人或机器自动评估。	Internet insurance is being tested in various places, but it is not reliable, because it cannot be evaluated by any person or machine automatically.
例如：保险600万元可以让你拿一个手机吧，免费领取6万元重疾保额，这些营销策略没有错，可是却避重就轻，不会告诉投保人，首月1元，次月是需要按正常收费的，几十到200不等，很多客户扣费一两年自己买的是个啥不清楚。	For example, buying insurance can get you a free phone, but it's not clear how much it will cost you in the long run.
因为认为可以花1块钱，保险公司赔600万（天下掉馅饼），但拒绝担保费用。	Because they thought they could spend 1 yuan, the insurance company paid out 600 million yuan, but refused to pay the premium fee.
免费送手机，是保单尾号6666，8888这种特殊保单号段才送的，并且如果中奖短信发出，自己不兑换，也没有人提醒的。	Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if you win a prize, you don't have to pay for it and no one will notify you.
（这对于保险人来说，就是一个坑）6万元的免费保额，是一年的，如果只靠这个，没有其他财务风险，万一真发生重疾，6万能干嘛，解决不了问题，以后的生活开始裸奔。	Free insurance coverage of up to 6 million yuan is available for one year, but if there is no other commercial risk, it is unlikely to solve the problem and life will become chaotic in the future.
目前，国家正在严厉打击互联网保险销售误导。	Currently, the government is aggressively combating misleading internet insurance sales.
因此，总体看，平台没有问题，产品也没有问题，且业务员的专业度和职业操守不足不够。	Therefore, overall, the platform was fine, the product was fine, and the issue was with the lack of professionalism and supervision of the staff.
建议主题主综合慎重考虑，因为在线保险经纪公司的产品更多，产品的性价比也比互联网产品更好。	Advise clients to consider their options carefully, as there are many more insurance products available online than offline, and the prices can be more competitive.
我自己帮助59位互联网客户，保费每个人节约2000-3000元/年。	I helped 59 Internet customers, ensuring the product and saving up to 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate with me and share your thoughts.
I am an experienced insurance agent with three years of corporate management training and over 1,000 customers served. I will start from customer needs and customize insurance products, actively bid for three insurance companies in the bidding, strive to get the best result for customers in the bidding, and meticulously arrange the insurance policy after the bidding. I will also take care of the follow-up work of the insurance policy and make sure that customers are worry-free.
With each client, we can grow together for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic owner!
根据保险监管部门的定义，互联网保险就是投保人点击投保链接后，可以自主完成所有的投保流程的保险业务。	According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Bureau, online insurance is when customers click on the insurance link and can complete the entire insurance process autonomously.
在投保过程中，投保人不需要签字，保险顾问也不需要签字，所有步骤都可以由投保人自主完成。	In the process of making a claim, the insured does not need to sign any documents, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign any documents either. All steps can be completed by the insured person autonomously.
无论是在线保险还是在线婚庆，它们都无法替换正式婚庆吧。	No matter if it's online insurance or online wedding, they can't replace a proper wedding ceremony.
在某些情况下，订阅保险可能会让人感觉不安，因为保险公司可能会偏见，订阅保险的后续服务可能会让人感觉不安。	In certain cases, subscribing to insurance may make people feel uneasy, as insurance companies may be biased and the subsequent service may make people feel uneasy.
保险是一种长期契约，当我们正在选择保险时，应该我们认真思议一下，我们可以多年依靠那个保险中介人吗？
我可以通过电话或者邮件联系到送餐专员。	I can contact the delivery staff either by phone or email.
It's already 3:00 PM.

Meta（原 Facebook）实质是一家广告公司，收入主要来自于广告，今时今日赚钱的广告公司，自己是有流量渠道的。	Meta (formerly Facebook) is an advertising company that earns most of its revenue from advertising, which is a company that has a flow of traffic.
无论是Facebook，Instagram，Whatsapp等，都是 Meta 的流量渠道。	No matter what function you are using, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., they are all Meta's flow channels.
不仅如此，Meta 还是最大的”广告联盟”，很多 App 外接 Meta 的广告，通过 Meta 的广告平台是实现变现。	In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", enabling many apps to display ads through the platform, thus achieving transformation.
However, times have changed.
第一，因为Apple's privacy policy changes, it has become difficult for Metta to obtain user data, which has affected its advertising efficiency.
当你正在使用苹果的应用时，它会显示一个易访问的易懒的提示，让你了解是否允许 App 获取你的信息。	When you are using an Apple application, it will display a clear and easy-to-understand prompt, allowing you to know whether you have allowed the app to access your information.
如果 Google 再捅一刀，Meta 的收入将会更多。	If Google continues to cut into Meta's revenue, it will be even more affected.
第二，Meta的收入增长在中国因素上也弱化了（这个因素的比重可能不确定，但确实存在）。	Second, the growth of Meta's income has weakened the Chinese factor (the weight of which is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
很多人都知道，Meta 在中国不可以运行的，但是这个理解并不准确。	Many people know that Meta cannot run in China, but this understanding is not definitive.

在香港办公室有几百人，在大陆还有几大代理商。	There are roughly 800 people working in the Meta office in Hong Kong, with a few dozen agents on the mainland.
中国公司想要拓展海外市场，Meta 都是绕不过的广告渠道，烧的钱大多都给了 Meta。	Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is the most popular advertising channel.
很有意思，目前字节的 TT 正在Meta 主要的竞争对手之一，但在前两年 Meta 从字节身上可以让很多钱。	It's remarkable that TT is one of the major competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has been able to make a lot of money from the byte.
在Meta 中华区的业绩很好，各个代理都在帮助各种广告。	The performance of the Meta Chinese region is very good, with various agents helping various advertisements.
近日，我没有做过准备，但我确信我能够几乎昨日的成绩占据。	Recently, I haven't prepared much, but I'm confident I can almost match my previous performance.
在海外大规模烧钱的阶段已经过去了，中国公司正在扩张各种业务。	Chinese companies have already passed the phase of large-scale overseas money burning. They are now expanding various businesses overseas.
Third, the new flow channel was not expanding smoothly.
某些人认为，Facebook 正在老化，而新的平台包括 TikTok 和 Twitter 在内，都不在 Meta 手中。	Some people believe that Facebook is aging, while new platforms such as TikTok and Twitter are gaining in popularity.
某些国家正在经济增长，但是它们正在面临几乎无法克服的问题。	Some countries are experiencing economic growth, but they are facing almost insurmountable problems.
许多股票易议含有各种不可排除的风险，因此，投资者应该在投资中心探议各种可能性。	Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with stocks, such as volatility and unpredictability, before investing.
Clearly, expectations for Meta were not met.

在下一三年，Meta 应该不足以支撑起市值，但元宇宙可能是未来的一个方向。	In the next three years, the value of Meta may not be enough to support its growth, but the universe may be the direction of the future.
因此，下雨后将会是 Meta 比较艰难的时期。	Therefore, it will be more difficult in the future.
在这个时刻，微软正在面临危机，其它互联网公司和高科技公司比较多，无论如何，微软还可以面对它们。	At this time, Microsoft is facing a crisis, but other internet companies and high-tech companies are more abundant, regardless of how, Microsoft can still face them.
尽管他的几款社交软件现在的日活比较高，但他还不可斗量到TikTok的快速发展，因此面对面都无法挑战，脸书也没有什么信心，颠覆之间也就是眨眼的功夫。	Although his various social media platforms are currently popular, he is no match for TikTok's rapid growth, so he is unable to challenge it and has no confidence.
它无论多久存在，都无法滩滩地存在，因此它无论多久存在，都无法滩滩地存在，因此它无论多久存在，都无法滩滩地存在。	No matter how long it has existed, it can never exist permanently, so it can never exist permanently, so it can never exist permanently.
