I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was so popular on TV.
Yesterday, I was watching Netflix in Chirori. But, there was nothing interesting in the scene, so the staff started to laugh behind me. It was really embarrassing.
It's not funny when people are trying to sell things. But it's really amusing when they're just talking. That's why I always laugh when I see a salesperson trying to be funny. It's not their fault if it doesn't work out.
Even if the staff don't laugh, it's still not fun to be around when the atmosphere is so tense and unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but it has since become too commercialized and ordinary. Some of the artists have become too proud and don't want to work with others. That's why I don't want to eat there anymore.
I can't help but feel sorry for the struggling artist within myself.
Although income is not much, I'm trying to make a living as an artist. It's hard work but I'm determined to reach the top of the toppest mountain.
There is a tendency for the media and society to favor beautiful and entertaining celebrities too much, and we are unable to hear any valid criticism against it.
It's quite difficult to make a living in this industry, but fortunately, the artist's world is filled with surprises and there are always new opportunities to be found.
You are so foolish.
I can't help but feel bad when I can't go out because I'm too tired.

I was so shocked when I received the wrong item I ordered from the online store.
The store promised to send a wireless mouse when I ordered it, but instead it sent a wired one. They said they would refund me if I wanted to return it.
Even though it is troublesome to purchase a self-made PC, it is still worth considering since it is a renowned place.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (including tax) at a Tsukumo net shop on the same day as the start of the sale.
Since the price of the same product with and without the wireless version was the same, I checked the price of the wireless version page as well and it was 5,071 yen (the link is to the Squidward page). There was no misprice, so I ordered it.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipment mail also arrived normally.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order to delivery, I thought the wirelessly delivered mouse would arrive at that moment.
From here it became a problem, and after several hours of shipment, I received an email saying "There was an error in product registration".
That's what the mail said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version that was being sold.
Because we are already sending wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
We will accept a return of a mouse and refund the money.
Use a wireless mouse without any modifications.
Choose an appropriate response.
It is noticed that the product page of the wireless and wired version have been mixed up, and the purchase records, email, and even the wireless version have been changed to the wired version without any reason.
You bought the item but didn't understand the differences between it and the similar items. Then you were sent back to the store without any refund. Is that too cruel?
Please lend me your wisdom so that I can repay the debt and launch a counterattack.

The only bridge out of the town that was swept away by the tsunami and flooding has been seen streaming out of the area in a video taken by a drone in the town of Kawai, Fukushima Prefecture. The residents are reportedly stockpiling food and water three times as much as usual.
Mr. Matsumoto from Shirakawa-chō, Takata-mura, Fukushima-ken.
The great impact of the 8-person sleeping arrangement in the third-floor room was felt in 2019's East Japan Typhoon.
Mr. Matsumoto san : "At first, it was the feeling of 'Majika'."
It felt so lonely and helpless as if I was the only one left in the world when the only path connecting the mountainous region, the Highland Bridge, was swept away by the East Japan Tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the local community were left in a desperate situation.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's wonderful that the road is coming closer and closer to the garden. If it comes all the way, I can just pick up my bike and ride it across the bridge. Or, if I can't find a place to park, I can just leave it on the sidewalk and walk across the bridge. Either way, it's great that there's a bridge so close by." One month later, a hastily built bridge was washed away by a heavy rainfall. The temporary bridge was too far away, and he was once again stranded in the middle of nowhere.
Although two years have passed since the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has been actively implementing countermeasures such as giving lectures.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about whether there is 10 cases or not.
We would like to ensure that people have enough to eat for at least two to three days after a disaster. To achieve this, we have developed food items such as canned and instant noodles that can be used for emergency food. These food items are approximately three times more abundant than before the disaster.
Ms. Masako Sato said, "I don't know when a disaster will strike me, so I'm trying to build up a bit of a reserve and be prepared for anything. I felt that way after experiencing the unexpected disaster." Meanwhile, Yamanashi Mayor Katsunobu Sato, who has experienced multiple disasters, said, "I'm always prepared for the unexpected."
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to develop its own unique take on the matter.
The mayor of Shirakawa-chō, Mr. Takashi Tsuchiya, and I, the principal of the Shirakawa-chō Education Center, would like to consider the measures to be taken for the Shirakawa-chō Disaster Prevention Day, which will be held on October 12th in the future. We would also like to announce the date in advance.
Even though we have experienced many unexpected events, our sense of awareness has been heightened.

When buying a used house, beware!
The Hole in the Ground Caused by the Earthquake Structure Inspection System (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
Towards the revitalization of the used housing market, a new system of "Building Condition Survey" has been set up. Used housing transactions have become popular.
The price of construction and the market for renovation are both increasing, showing a tendency towards expansion.
As the number of earthquake-related deaths increases, the popularity of words such as "station", "nearby", and "direct connection" has grown rapidly. These words represent buildings that have become popular due to their relatively low cost and ease of construction. This has had a significant impact on the number of new buildings being built.
Although existing (used) housing share in Japan is still low in comparison with overseas, it is gradually increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started an inspection of building conditions, which is called "inspection" in Japanese, in 2018 to ensure safe and secure used houses. (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf)
This is a system in which a builder who has become skilled in residential construction checks the current situation and condition of the building, including its deterioration, and presents it to the prospective buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers when it comes to the introduction of inspe Home » News » News » 2018 » 2018 Nissan Leaf: The Future of Electric Cars is HereThe 2018 Nissan Leaf is here, and it’s the perfect electric car for those looking to make a statement.

By conducting an inspection of the item before the purchase transaction, the merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning afterward and provide the customer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been increasing due to the competitive nature of society.
Even if you are on the buying side, it is possible to grasp the condition of used houses for purchase, and it is possible to purchase them at a reasonable price with this system. It is a system that is beneficial to see.
On the system of the current Japanese building, the principal responsibility for supervising the condition survey lies with the owner.
Please pay attention to the fact that the notification of the inspection system has become the responsibility of the company.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to check the building conditions when dealing with property, but there is no obligation to do so.
Although there is a risk of becoming anxious in the inspection of the salesperson in Japan, overseas it is possible to turn one's eyes to the active used car markets of America and England, where similar systems have already been set up.
Before engaging in the process of buying or selling a house, the buyer usually hires a specialist such as an inspector or building surveyor to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the case of America, the percentage of inspections for used houses in the states ranges from 70 to 90%.
In terms of the point that "buyer's agent" is leading the inspection, the main difference between Japanese-style inspection and its nature is great.
The landlord can often be seen inspecting the condition of the building, trying to keep it in the best shape possible.
We are considering moving to a place where the landlord is kind and willing to cooperate with us in terms of survey.
Even if we have the same intention and thought, it is difficult to avoid misunderstanding.
For this reason, the risk of becoming complacent about the Japanese system is highlighted by the following points:
The range of inspection of the sales promotion type of direct selling shall not be minimized.
Because we don't do detailed surveys, there is a risk of missing important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing customer cases and showing them to the customers is important.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the company does not report unfavorable survey results to the customer.

Is the Silver Zone an island?
Silver-haired people are often seen talking in cafes, but what kind of conversations do they have? Here are 5 popular topics among the silver-haired.
This place used to be a part of the ancient continent of Atlantis.
That's why there are so many interesting things to be discovered in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square in Tokyo. It's quite interesting and entertaining.
Go up to the Silver Zone!?
He dived into the goldfish bowl.
As you walk through the Ginza district, you can find mysterious stone monuments, numerous temples, and a history of the area carved in stone.
As she walked to the Silver Zone, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a profound silence. She realized that this place was the ancient remnant of the Silver Zone.
Is the Ginza district of Tokyo?
The nickname "Ginza" for the bustling shopping district in Tokyo has become widely used.
The Ginza, which is known as the "Silver Coin" in English, was originally a silver coin mint in 1612 (Kangxi 17th year) and was moved to present-day Tokyo in 1613.
At that time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but eventually became known as "Ginza" due to its transfer to that location.
According to the locals, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed through the area now known as Tokyo, and the surrounding marshes were filled in to create the man-made island of Edo-jima. From the Edo-jima, the river flowed on to the Nihonbashi area, where the area was further filled in to create the Shinjuku and Shibuya areas.
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Ginza.
Toyotaka Hideyoshi opened a ruling palace in Edo and buried the moat, thus beginning the construction of the Kyobashi district.
We have to rebuild our homes and improve public infrastructure, as well as develop water transportation, in order to achieve balanced regional development.
Then they dug up the earth at the burial ground and threw it into the river. They also cut down the sacred mountain and buried it.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument marking the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in the history of Ginza, it is worth taking a look.
People know the Silver Zao as the "Holy Ground Pilgrimage".
Silver Zaka has the "Silver Zaka Hachimangu Shrine MEGURI" ritual, which is held annually.
In the backstreets of 10 or more shrines in the vicinity of the famous Kabuki Theater, the most picturesque and photogenic is the Kagurazaka Inari Shrine.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki play.
One side, the "Lion King" statue is on the roof of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, the "Silver Seed" statue is on the 9th floor of the Tokyo Skytree.
The shrines "Toriton Inari" and "Atsukamori Inari" are located in a corner of the premises, while "Toriton Inari" is known to be dedicated to the actor Nakamura Kanzaburō. The shrine "Toriton Inari" is also known to have been visited by the geisha Hatsune. The shrine "Success Inari" is located in the basement of the Success Building, and is only open to the public during the festival of the Hachiman Shrine.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian spirits as well as the gods of the land and mountains. However, most shrines only worship the gods of harvest by offering rice and other agricultural products.
In front of the shrine, a fox would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the shrine was built with the hope of receiving the good luck of the five grains.
As it has been transformed into a bustling metropolis like Kyoto and Edo, the benefits of commercial activities are becoming increasingly apparent. Not only in Japan, but also in other cities such as Tokyo's Ginza and Yokohama's Minato Mirai, faith is also spreading.

Body of Male Found in Shounan-ku, Naka-kyo Ward, Tokyo (NHK News) - Yahoo! News
It was discovered that a male body was found floating in the Shounan River in the Minami Ward of Nagoya City on the 12th of the month.
The police are investigating the cause of death and other related information of a male.
At around 11:30am on November 12th, a male was found unconscious in a river near Shimizu-dori, in the Shimizu district of Tokyo. A passerby noticed him and called the police, who sent out an emergency report with the case number 110.
Although male was rescued from the river, it was confirmed dead at the scene.
The police are investigating the cause of death together with the confirmation of identity of the body.
It was confirmed that an elderly man in his 70s was found lying down in the sand of the creek in Okazaki City, Fukoka Prefecture.
Unfortunately, there was a commotion in the male clothing store, but near the bicycle was overturned.
The police are checking the identity of the suspect and investigating the current situation together.
Is the payment for the 2-month tax and fee exemption for the elderly, handicapped and single-person households included in the payment for the 1-person non-taxable household?
I'm sorry, but I can't confirm the shipment yet.

The Korean-based Posco International has acquired the Senex Energy Group, a major Australian natural gas producer, and is looking to expand its overseas business.
Posco International announced on November 12 that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement and an investment agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, aiming to invest in Senex Energy's acquisition of Hancock Energy.
Since the necessary procedures such as the approval of the host and local NGOs at the Senexx Enagie's Annual General Meeting are still pending, the purchase and sale procedures are expected to be completed by March 2021.
In 2010, the acquisition of Posco by the Posco Group became the world's largest M&A (merger and acquisition) case in the history of purchase and merger.
The total amount of money invested in Posco International and Hankook Enayat is 50.1% and 49.9%, respectively. They have decided to invest in these two companies respectively.
Posco International has been increasing steadily in the energy transition era and the demand for natural gas is continuously increasing in the hydrogen market, and has decided to divide the market with green hydrogen.
Posco International will secure 802Bcf of natural gas storage and 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in Korea through this purchase. Furthermore, it will also secure local human resources for land-based gas fields.

That pain in the knee, if it's not treated properly, could be "Changement Knee Joint Disease"!!
Different Treatment Methods According to Cause - Yahoo! News
The Editing Team has been suffering from pain in the butt recently.
Is there a possibility of catching such a disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The pain of the knee joint may be caused by various factors such as knee joint stiffness, ligament and tendon injuries, and overuse.
In Japan, it is very common for people to have "joint contracture diseases" such as kyphosis and scoliosis.
Is it possible that the editing team will be affected by the changes in the script?
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
Our job is to protect the soft tissues covering the surfaces of joints by wrapping them with flexible tissues and to make joint movements smoothly.
The reason why soft tissues become stiff and deformed is due to aging, obesity, and intense sports.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Is the transformation joint disorder limited to the knee only or can it also manifest elsewhere?
Mr. Maruyama: Hello.
Even outside of the palm and fingers, the wrist, thumb, shoulder, hip, leg, and foot joints and attachments such as the acromion process, clavicle, and pubic symphysis can be affected.
However, the most common case is a foot case, which is called "foot-and-mouth disease".
Editing Team: What kind of structure does the joint have?
Mr. Maruyama said, "The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are irregularly arranged."
Then, the two-sided part which is covered by "Joint Flexible Cartilage" is surrounded by "Joint Pack" in order to protect the joint.
The Editing Department is complicated and structured.
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
There is a layer of lubricating tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule. It creates the joint fluid by secreting lubricating substances.
This synovial fluid plays a role of lubricant and is composed of hyaluronate acid and condroiti
It is said that "moving the knee joint smoothly requires good hyaluronic acid or condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms do people with Transforming Joints Disease (TJD) typically experience?
Professor Maruyama: Connective tissues are elastic and flexible, and bones do not directly touch each other, so they have to bear the role of providing stability.
Iwaba is a role like that of a maid in a cafe.
Unfortunately, if you continue to strain yourself, it can cause joint deformities, inflammation, and pain.
Should I sleep in pajamas?
You sleep in your basic pajamas, but when it's time to wash your pajamas, you change into regular clothes!

You can actually experience the thrill of "Kaiji" series gamble and game in real life! (Real sound) - Yahoo! News
Gyaru manga series "Kaji" centering on male characters, which is popular for its explosive and wild plot.
There is one game with an extreme sense of purpose hidden in the depths of this work.
[Picture] Just watching the feet move...... Challenging the Iron Bridge!
Let's test the game of the Kai-Jin that is actually being played in the current situation, or the planning video.
The trap-filled Pachinko Parlour "Nul" appeared in the movie "Gambling Ghost Story".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the spectators.
This "pond" has a huge trap of the 3-stage curtain installed, making it almost impossible to infiltrate.
They used every available hand to lower the water table beneath the foundation of the building, and eventually succeeded in overturning the defenses.
The character "Kai" from the anime Kai Ni Tomare made an appearance in the game as a Pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Even though things like "One-Thousand-Dollar Coupons" have become less common, it is still possible to enjoy the feeling of getting something for nothing.
The "Star Side Party" was held, in which the participants included a group of investors who had been subjected to a pyramid scheme. It was a re-enactment of the "Torikago" ritual from the "Human Chariot" race.
The debtors were running as fast as they could while they were trying to come up with a plan to avoid falling off the thin steel bones that were set up on the ground 10 meters above.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win the prize money, but there is only one steel bone, which is not enough for safety measures, and the chance of death is quite high.
This steel bridge is very dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game and installed at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", where it is possible to have an extremely close experience.
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors) and is located at a steel-framed bridge which is called "Skybride" and "Victory Bridge" at its end. People are encouraged to walk towards it.
We are taking safety measures.
Comedian Corey Holcomb's video of "Exploring Japan" went viral on YouTube, becoming a hit sensation.
This is a two-player card game called "EKaard".
Use one Emperor card, eight citizen cards, and one slave card to make a deck of 10 cards for each side, Emperor side, and slave side to play.
This game is very popular and the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
Kayako is struggling with a harsh rule of "If you lose, you have to cut your own ears off" against the River Raisin.
A machine that can sense changes in blood pressure and body temperature, such as when a person is feeling stressed, by breaking down the ear resembling an iPod was filled with awe and shock. The person then used this machine to cause chaos in the river Ganges by severely lowering their body temperature to an abnormal value, resulting in victory.
The card is available in stores, such as Amazon, where it can be purchased.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, appeared in a movie as a karate master and challenged his opponent to a fight using an EKG machine in the video which has become a sensation.
Is it possible to enjoy the flavor of the wind?
No one wants to suffer from a misfortune like the one in the story, but reading comics can make you feel better.
As you go through the game, you will be able to feel the worldview.
Take a step towards the new year, and make it special by visiting a shrine or temple. In this article from the Yamanashi newspaper, there is a picture of a beautifully decorated horse at a Shinto shrine.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Kagami Shrine (in Yamagata City), and a giant ema featuring the Chinese zodiac animal of the upcoming year, the Dog, has appeared.
On November 11th, 11 students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited a shrine and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting apprenticeship of the original painting of the horse from a craftsman since last year.

I want to continue living in Tama-no. I propose a workshop for high school students in the city. The theme is "Digital Tama-no News".
What kind of town was the Yamanouchi of 2030?
Students from four high schools in the city of Tomakomai are participating in a workshop to discuss the idea of continuing to live in Tomakomai.
We will investigate and propose policies for the youth employment business at the "Tamano S.D.G.S. Miraluzuki Center" and present the voice of the youth to the mayor.
What is funny in such a situation?
When the student was asked about the quality of the facsimile, he replied, “When many people are working together, it will lead to success.” He also said, “We should keep pushing forward even if we fail many times.”
The first event was opened at the Sunshine Ace Building on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and the locals from the area gathered around a table to discuss the themes they had chosen, such as "The Most Interesting Town", "The Most Livable Town" and "The Town That Makes You Feel Alive".
Each person's thoughts were written on a slip of paper and organized by sewing them onto a fabric.
The town with many young people is interesting. There are many transportation options such as trains and buses that do not cause any inconvenience.

The Secret of Store Shopping (Sankei News) - Yahoo! News
You must not miss out on any stores during the winter, but there is nothing you can do about getting a cold.
It is said that if you adjust the balance while looking into a mirror, it will become easier to tell the time. However, I have never been able to hear that mysterious voice.
When I thought there might be a secret store hidden somewhere, I was surprised to find a new item.
The store of the brand "Cotto" (Kotori) is said to be around 1 meter long, making it more compact than the average store.
When I first saw it, I wondered if it was possible to make something so short and twisty.
When you look at it closely, you can see that it is a piece of cloth that has been carefully cut and sewn together into one long, thin piece. It has a net-like pattern all over.
The ends of the web are woven together so that stores can be opened and closed as needed.
Even if you don't connect the two ends, you can wrap it up and keep it.
The fabric is very light and warm.
This year, the popular trend is to combine a sleeveless top with a jacket, so that the jacket can keep you warm while still showing off the sleeveless style.
If you have a store like this, it is very convenient.

The documentary of the Beatles at Disneyland is super interesting.
Although Peter Jackson directed The Lord of the Rings, he was not credited as the main director.
There are so many different kinds of beetles, and they are all so fascinating……
Even though the scattering was about to begin, the sound of the gunshots echoed through the air. It was a dramatic and chilling scene.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I could understand what Paul and George were talking about! I was so surprised! Then I started to talk slowly and carefully, but it was too late. I had already been caught up in the moment and I couldn't stop talking.
It's so irritating when people complain all the time and don't try to help themselves. But then, there's something really inspiring about the atmosphere at Beatles concerts. It's like everyone's in this magical, positive vibe together.
Then, everyone will start to play music in that wonderful atmosphere.
From the phrase "It's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not right!" to "That's not fair!" to "That's not

Although it was only one chapter of three, it was still very interesting. The maximum cause of the breakup was the environment around it.
Four people gathered to make a song. They were so excited to start creating something new. But where should they perform their live? Talking about it made them realize that they should be a producer and a promoter to make it happen. They said, “Let’s take the Beatles worldwide from here!” and started to work on it.
Since the documentary explains the director's intentions, it seems that Peter Jackson felt that way……
Because Paul is taking care of the scene, there are many villains and monsters in it. That's what I thought.

In America, a large number of tornadoes caused severe damage to crops and caused an unexpected cold weather (Weather News - Yahoo! News).
A typhoon with multiple spiral arms has developed over the Americas South-east region from the 10th (Friday) night to the 11th (Saturday).
As a result, the atmospheric condition became very unstable due to strong cold air from the south below, and the clouds developed rapidly.
The southwestern United States is experiencing record-breaking warm temperatures, with temperatures in some areas reaching up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in the Houston area is expected to be around 30°C (86°F) for the next 9 days (Tuesday to Friday) and 10 days (Saturday to Monday).
In a place where it was record-breakingly warm, a strong cold air from the south suddenly arrived at an altitude of 5500m below, causing an active frontal cloud to rapidly develop in the shape of a line.
It was reported that the dragon egg was hatching in the suburbs.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the occurrence of hurricanes decreases significantly during the summer and fall. However, there are many cases of large damage during the period from the summer to the fall.
The warning issued in one day during the winter season was reportedly heard 150 times near the location. It was reported in great abundance with a record-breaking number of people.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States has reported 400+ reports of storms and tornadoes in just 10 days (Friday) alone.
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the United States that are heavily concentrated along the southern and northern lines that extend from Texas to California and include the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado.
In the EF Scale, which is used to measure the strength of dragons in the Kanto region, the third strongest dragon, which was the 6th stage, reached EF3. During this time, a sudden gust of 70m/s was observed.
It is possible to determine whether an EF4 or EF5 tornado will occur in the future by further research.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the damage of buildings and other structures due to natural disasters based on the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of JEF3 infection in America is high enough to cause considerable damage, such as in wooden-built houses.

The voice of "the world's greatest sumo wrestler" from the comic book "Miyamoto Musashi" is being sought to help broadcast the live event from under the ring. (Newsweek)
With regards to the typhoon damage in the U.S. Central and Southern states, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11th (Japanese time: November 12th), showed a remarkable performance of "the greatest typhoon damage in U.S. history" with a spiritual and impressive attitude.
CNN and other news channels reported it.
Biden emphasized that he would be able to do anything as the leader of a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the loss of so many lives.
The fear of death has surpassed 100 people.
In Ken Takaki County, California, where the damage from the tornado was taken, the residents carried household goods and furniture from the destroyed homes to the road. It was done for 10 nights and 11 days without rest, and the tornado in Ken Takaki County and other states exceeded 30.
The record of 219 miles (350 kilometers) of damage caused by the 1925 Tokyo typhoon, including in Mizoram State, is still left, but a meteorologist of the U.S. CNN estimated the maximum scale of the damage to be around 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In the wake of the devastating tornado in Kennett, Missouri, the Christmas shopping season was marred by a 24-hour state of emergency at the large factory, resulting in immense damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were gone.
A woman who was unable to move her legs due to the thickness of the darkness beneath the grate felt the weight of the rescuing officer as he searched for her above the grate on his smartphone and Facebook live broadcast.
In addition to the female announcer's plea for help, the singing of "Happy Birthday to You" was heard in a shaky, trembling voice, as if to evoke fear.
An employee of a convenience store in Meifield, named Barbara Brown, was able to hide her 5-year-old son and herself in the basement of her house without any harm when the warning siren sounded.
There were many people who listened to the sound of the train, but it was a fearsome sound like a low rumble of the ground.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take to recover from this disaster. But we will continue our selfless rescue efforts with a strong will.
In Irino, Ibaraki Prefecture, a warehouse of popular online shopping mall Amazons has collapsed, and at least 6 people have been confirmed dead.
The impact of the train car cutting off is so strong that it causes the fence to be broken and cars to be derailed, and the roads are blocked by the train crash.
It is reported that approximately 40 million hotel rooms in the U.S. are affected by the power outage caused by the Web media in Texas.

It is an old proverb that different approaches are taken towards the evaluation system of star charts.
Other countries are arguing to reduce their carbon footprints based on the 5-star system, while Japan is arguing to increase its carbon footprint/reduce its carbon footprint based on the 3-star system.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, and four stars are "poor element" and "excellent work".
When a work is evaluated based on five stars, the tendency is that the best work will be the one that has the highest score, and the worst work will be the one that has the lowest score. Therefore, it is not desirable to present a system that allows for a negative star rating. For example, if a work is rated 3 stars (negative evaluation), it should not be allowed to present such a system.
Those who are advocating for Steam's 2-tier pricing system will eventually run out of things to say due to lack of response.

The Radio Show
I tried to make an AM radio with a condenser and coil, but there was too much noise so I couldn't hear it clearly.
The frequency of the radio station I heard was different from the one I was tuning.

"Fresh Sashimi and Sushi from the Nearby Ocean - Make it at Home with this Special Tuna and Ebi Sushi Recipe"
A colorful bounty of vegetables, carefully crafted into delicious takeout meals at the specialty store "Hakobune".
"We want to make a restaurant where people can enjoy delicious food at a reasonable price," said Kagetsu Kikuchi (39) and his wife, Yumiko (38). The couple opened a restaurant last August.
One of the popular menu items at the convenience store is "Fresh Fish and Shrimp Flatbread Sandwiches" (1000 yen).
People sometimes buy nice things at the market.
"Flaky pastries like croissants are popular in Japan, but they can be expensive. Ebi-flaky is an affordable alternative that still has the same delicious, buttery flavor." (Kikuko-san)
Vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, onions, and potatoes are used to make a hearty meal of ramen, a type of Japanese noodle soup. Toppings such as sesame seeds, seaweed, and chili peppers are also added for flavor.
Vegetables are usually grown in a vegetable garden at home and then sold at a local farmers' market.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Mr. Kagayama always adds a touch of flavor with French cuisine. He serves dishes like ratatouille and mashed potatoes.
One of the most popular Japanese dishes is sushi. It is a delicious combination of rice and fish or vegetables rolled in seaweed and topped with various condiments. Sushi is enjoyed by people of all ages, from all walks of life. It is a great example of the unique blending of traditional Japanese culture and modern Western cuisine.
Popular items include "Kokusan Gohan" (1000 yen) and "Hamburg" (500 yen).
From next year, we will also be selling the processed meat product "Sharaku Tori Set" which can be used for making wine.

One man was killed and another injured in a hit-and-run incident involving a man bike in Saga City, Japan on December 12th. The incident happened at a large scale event in Saga City.
At 1:25 AM on June 12th in Saga City, Fukuoka Prefecture, a 40-year-old man was stabbed in the face with a knife by a man in his 30s to 40s.
The man escaped on a bike and the Saga Police are following his trail as a suspicious murder case.
According to the police, there was a person "kicking" at the south station. There were also 110 calls made.
Men typically have a penis about 10 centimeters in length and a circumcision about 1 centimeter in depth, but their consciousness is still there.

A Family's Long Path of Environmental Protection Activities in China's Necropole (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Katō Yūki: Hong Kong Companies Find Asia Consultant) A vast country with diverse landscapes such as China is important in terms of biodiversity, with species of mammals such as the world's first and third largest plant species.
Recognizing the value of biodiversity as a self-governing body, the self-governing body is not only carrying out environmental protection, but also actively promoting environmental activities.
The province of Sichuan in China's southwestern region is one of the regions located in the area.
The area of Shisapangan, Laos and Myanmar is a region that shares the culture of the Tai people and the Lue tribe. It is the starting point of the Tai people and the Lue tribe, and many minority ethnic groups live there.
The source of the Mekong River is flowing through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Saisiyat people (Southwestern Tai people) live in the Saisiyat Autonomous County of Taiwan. The area of Saisiyat is only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the wildlife species and 20% of the plant species in China.
This time, I visited Lixin Li, the founder of the environmental protection organization, Shesapannan, to learn about their activities and to show my support.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together ― They have been doing it for 20 years.
What was that sudden noise?
Mr. Li has been engaged in environmental protection activities under the name "Tenchu" since 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This area is the only tropical rainy forest in China, and it boasts a great diversity of life.
Despite that, the economy has been slowing down on that side.
As a result, numerous large-scale logging operations have been carried out in China to meet the demand for rubber.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
Then, after getting to know the reporter here, I got married.
Was Mr. Li interested in nature conservation before?
My father is from Shishapangma, but I have no interest in the significance and biodiversity of the mountain.
We have become accustomed to advancing the project without knowledge or experience.
Although the face is adjusted without any special effort, the back is not high enough to be seen by others. Why is that?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.
In that moment of self-confidence, a moment when you believe in yourself, a miracle of nature will be born.
That person is definitely confident in their inner strength and is determined to keep pushing forward.

I think it's interesting to talk about what people are wearing, but it's even more interesting to talk about their fashion sense and style.
Is it okay if it's thin?
It looks like it's going to rain soon.
I am thinking about something small and delicate.
It seems like there's nothing to say, so I don't know what to say. It's a bit confusing.
Did you wash your face with a lot of water?
What will happen if you confess to the police?
I confessed to my crush and my heart was filled with spring fever. I hope we can meet again soon.
Then, I want to share my knowledge of golf and my love of it with others.
If we don't open a NISA account now, will it be possible to open it at a later time?

This will be completed within one week.
We recommend opening a NISA account at the same time as opening a trading account.

[Personal Memory Loss] Due to the cause of CTD, it took me about a month and a half to finally identify the problem.
Although there were multiple factors that caused CTD to arise during the time when there was not enough time to play GW, I was able to identify it by feeling a bit frustrated.
Why didn't you log analysis with the.Net Script Framework? (It's easy to understand in a few minutes.) Some errors related to DLL series and hash functions can't be ignored in crash logs.
The timing of the main CTD was set.
* All plug-ins, such as Papyrus and.NET Script Framework, should leave a trace in the log.dll plug-ins' log without leaving any footprints.
If you have the SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's revised version of the Essentials mod installed, it will cause the console to crash when you try to kill an NPC. To fix this, go into the OFF folder and delete the file called "Essentials.esm".
When the camerawork for the kirmus was off, it could be fixed by setting the kirmus off in the.ini file. However, the upper limit of the number of kirmus animations for each NPC is 10,000, so it may be difficult to adjust the settings for the kirmus related to DAR and Nemesis.
* (Basic Outdoor) Field Movement + Partial Magic (Example: Ice Trap Run) Activation, NPC Death: Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID Usage NPC Applicable Setting (MCM's Right Top) All Off, All Improved 5 Times in a Row.
Is there a misconfiguration of armor and body meshesheets that causes this issue? The default SPID usage in 2.0 has a syntax error but the result is intended to be an effect applied to NPCs with the prerequisite Perk "Actor".
At first, we focused on OnHit relations and movement/combat MOD (DLL related) by soaking our clothes in water. However, this resulted in such a feeling.
I have never seen a similar bug report in English or German, even at the advanced level.
People who are struggling with similar CTD problems in a Japanese language environment may find it helpful to refer to this post as a reminder.
Everyone is talking and laughing in the mental room.
Around it is not interesting, but same-aged people are still family.
When you take a walk, you may meet someone who is very different from you. You may feel uncomfortable at first, but if you stay positive and keep working, it can be an enriching experience. You can also take it as an opportunity to explore and appreciate the culture.
He was so scared that he started to shiver uncontrollably.
Even though I am not retired yet, I feel like there is a limit to what I can do before I retire.
I am thinking about the importance of spiritual care visitation nursing - today's visitation nursing has ended.
Because I have a dual-axial disability, I have been undergoing long-term care visiting nurses' care, but I am very grateful to have established a good relationship with the visiting nurses' station's nurse (female) who has been very kind and helpful.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medications and medical supplies in the nursing home (such as packaging), it is more important for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which was discussed in today's visit nursing.
Today, we discussed the differences between men and women, and it was quite amusing.
Talking about sexual desire between men and women, or how she decided to get a divorce, or such interesting topics can be discussed during a visit to the nursing home.
Although I am wearing a dress, I am still a man.
When the visiting nurses' station at the psychiatric hospital was closed, there was no one to give instructions to the visiting nurses or the occupational therapists, so I heard stories like, "This place is where medical care is provided, so you should know what to do," from people who had worked there.
I am using the social welfare system, but it is a small visiting care station run by the social welfare organization, so I am grateful for the kindness of the staff, who understands my mental illness and treats me kindly. I hope to find a good caregiver like Frank.
You are so beautiful.
Both those who have experienced psychiatric care and those who are considering it should be respected.
Visiting a nursing home is very meaningful for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.

The patent of the water technology of Korea and the delay of the Hydrogen Economy Load Map Walk (Central China News Japanese Edition - Yahoo! News)
The Japanese government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap for 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 600,000 electric vehicles in Japan and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of water was set to 6,000 yen per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
This year, the target of 27% for fuel cell vehicles in the 11th Five-Year Plan is too ambitious, with around 1700 units.
The percentage of waterfront development in the nuclear core infra-structure is 38%, including 117 sites (approximately). The price of hydrogen was almost the same as the time of the announcement and the load map. It was 8400 tons of woo.
It has been found that the load map of water resources for the government is far below the target value.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) reported on the current situation and policy directions of the Hydrogen Economy on December 12.
According to reports, the core components and materials of the nuclear industry are mainly dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the lithium-ion battery for automobiles is carbon fiber from Toho (Japan), platinum catalyst from Kyocera (Japan), menbrane from DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA) etc.
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea and Germany, are actively participating in the hydrogen technology patent race, with an average annual growth rate of 14% since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of water production and fuel cells in Japan (2014-2020 cumulative), Korea is the fifth in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has been dominated by six countries, who collectively occupy more than 50% of the world's market share. In reality, they are the low-end producers.
The order of patent application filing in Japan, China, the U.S., and Europe is China, the U.S., Japan, and Europe.
Since China has been pulling away from the US in the 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) were ranked 4th and 10th respectively, but China's (4721 cases) 22% standard was the highest.
The Japanese government should designate "water element technology" as a major "national strategy technology" and invest in its research and development, as proposed by the Japanese Water Element Association.

Is selling expensive items at a fixed price shop considered a crime?
The PS5 was sold out within 7 minutes at the store.
It is suitable.
For example, when branded goods become more expensive than usual, the demand for them decreases and the value of the goods decreases as well.
For example, if a renowned artist's work increases in value over time, it is considered to be a legal practice.
The price of Ps5 is high, but it is still a rare and valuable item. Its price has risen higher than its original value.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine as part of a training mission for the country's armed forces, according to a report by CNN.
The U.S. State Department reported on December 12th that the Bihac National Government had accepted a plan for humanitarian assistance based on the provision of weapons and ammunition by the United States.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million US dollars (approximately 68 billion yen), and the last equipment item consisting of a radar 4 base to identify the launch site of the rocket in Ukraine has been transported.
According to the Cabinet Office of Japan, these weapons of mass destruction also included combat vehicles such as the "Javelin".
The purpose of Russia's military support for Ukraine is to strengthen its national defense capabilities in the border area, including by receiving weapons, equipment, and training.
The United States is warning Russia to respect the movement of its military forces in the Pacific, and is negotiating with NATO countries and Japan to form a coordinated response in case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The Baiden Big Brotherhood had agreed to accept weapons assistance from Ukraine's Zelenskyy Big Brotherhood when they visited the White House on September 1st, 2019.
Military support from the United States to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of approximately 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, resulting in a huge increase in aid to Ukraine.

The LDP and Komeito are planning to raise the consumption tax, and they are trying to sneak it through by linking it to the "emergency donations" tax system. The Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party should take a strong stance against this and attack them with all they have!
The first special issue of the Weekly Daiyamondo magazine on December 18th, 2018 is about "Talking with Family at the End of the Year and the Beginning of the Next".
This is a technique called "pre-match gift-giving and coercion".
In the discussion of the unification of the consumption tax and the corporate tax, there was a sense of unease in 2022 Tax Reform, but it is likely that pre-emptive gift-giving will be restricted in the future.
How do the rules of etiquette change with different cultures?
The leader of the LDP and the DPJ member of the House of Representatives, together with a direct appeal to the members of the Diet, to meet within the year, and to be generous donations without wasting any of the basic principles of taxation techniques.
(Diamond Editing Department, Miyahara Keiichi)
We should consider taxation of pre-emptive donations from asset-rich families to urban-based companies in order to integrate more closely the taxation of successive donations and donations, in order to build a neutral tax system from the perspective of taxation of asset transfer during the period of choice.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill, which was announced by the ruling party last year, has caused a wide range of movements, not just among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because it changes the rules of succession and increases the burden of taxation, it is called "forbidden donation" and is done to increase the burden of succession taxes.
The steel rule for taxing high-income earners is to reduce taxable wealth.
The gift of life insurance before marriage has been widely utilized by companies with employees living in the three major metropolitan areas, despite its low cost.
Discussion on the integration of the Succession Tax and Donation Tax.
The Ministry of Finance announced on December 10th, 2019 the 22nd tax reform plan, which included a clarification of the current law regarding the calculation of taxes and the granting of tax-exempt status. The announcement stated, “We will make it clear how the current tax system works and how the annual grant system works.” It also stated that the granting of tax-exempt status should not be used to avoid taxes and should be constantly reviewed. This was the second time in a year that the ministry had announced a plan to integrate the tax system.
The chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee, Mr. Kanai, spoke.
Making full use of the timing of asset transfers and avoiding losses is the most important thing.
"What kind of problems will come up as a result of integration? We are simulating the situation and will have three more chances for pro bono donations."
Even if it is not certain, it is the near future, and it is necessary to consider tax reduction measures as a form of pre-tax gift. Cutting large taxes is not correct.
How will the rules of succession tax and donation tax change specifically?

At this play, Esper W. Digger was running around the right outer area, but he couldn't get into the Endzone.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from outside the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabrielle Davidson. The pass was deflected by Payton's DB Miles Brian and Arlen failed to make a successful completion.
Brian had been working on the WRC Corral Beasley Walls for days, but when he saw the movement of the alien he let go of the WRC Corral Beasley Walls and reacted to the pass.
Allen threw two Endorses in order to pass the Reshiram and Zekrom.
We couldn't decide whether to take a 4th down or not, but there was no need to take a 3rd down since we weren't chasing any TDs.
It is possible to win a first down in two attempts of a play.
Since I was still far from the 2 Minute Point, I had to sprint to the 4th&Short and use my own running ability to make it in time.

3 items to spruce up your kitchen for the long term: 1. A set of coasters 2. A storage jar 3. A kitchen timer (Harper's BAZAAR)
Sponge
Even if you frequently replace it with something else, it will eventually become spongy.
From the research of 2017, it was found that kitchen sponges were often contaminated with bacteria even after using an electronic scrubber (although it was still preferred to use an electronic scrubber to kill bacteria). It was also revealed that bacteria grew exponentially when exposed to an electronic scrubber.
The German researcher who conducted this study recommended that the subject should rinse their mouth with a cleaning agent for one week and exchange the sponge once a day.

The United States Department of Agriculture is urging people to replace rotten and damaged fruit and vegetables with fresh ones.
Whenever a wound or a sore progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria start to multiply.
If you are still a big man, then dilute 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water with an odorless liquid bleach to make a table spoonful of solution and frequently disinfect your body without forgetting.
Immerse a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.

Why do you feel ashamed of having brand products?
If it's something you can't put down, like a book or a bag of chips, it's better to leave it alone. Even if it's a designer bag or a pair of shoes, it's not worth the risk of getting your hands dirty.
Why?
I think it's nice to be able to help others.
I think Japan is great.
In Japan, it is.
There is no connection between the Gajin Wind and the Kanji.
It's better to say something early than to remain silent, right? "Why do you keep quiet all the time?"
Why can't I just be a foreigner? I was so confused when I first came here.
I'm so frustrated with the low probability of success. I can't stop thinking about it in my dreams either.
Although I had been living in a foreign country, I had never felt so out of place until a Japanese person told me to go back to my own country.
If you appear to be a Westerner, there is no need to be concerned about having an evil spirit. Just be yourself and you will be fine.
If my friends were all European, I would be more comfortable talking in English than Japanese. But since some of them don't understand Japanese, I end up talking in a mix of Japanese and English.
If you're friends with someone from Japan, they'll probably be really nice.
Even though it's just ordinary, it's still important to handle it with care. Otherwise, it will become a problem in the future.
Even if you speak Japanese, you can't understand the rules of the Japanese language.
When I go back to my hometown, my foreign friend always serves me alcohol in a tall glass even though we have no relation.
Japanese people have a lot of unique habits, such as bowing and greeting each other with a lot of respect. I think it's amazing how they handle these habits in both formal and informal situations.
Japanese people are known for their unique and delicate sense of beauty, even though they are notorious for being frugal. (Including myself.)

There are various reasons why people want to have a place of their own to relax. Some people want to have a place to call their own, while others may want a place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Some people may want a place to pursue their hobbies, while others may want a place to spend quality time with their friends and family. Everyone has their own unique reasons for wanting a place to call their own.

Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been popular among young people. However, it is said to be full of irregularities, with the phrase "the number of modifications is increasing".
There is no battle in the story, and readers don't seem to like the training and refining of skills either.
It took two years of hard training to become as powerful as the One Piece manga character, but all it took was a single touch to make him fly away joyfully.
There is a mysterious charm to the eclectic shops lining the riverside. Even though it may be inconvenient to always stay in the same place for repair, there is something attractive about it.
After the main character, Burakku Tarou, completed his training with the sword of the exorcist, Kyoujin, he was praised by the great warrior, Yoshimori, who had been waiting beneath the ground. He had been trying to obtain the stolen life of the pest, Inugami, by using the power of murder and theft. It was said that Yoshimori praised him for his courage.

"Sou-gintsu" (literally, "Demon Slayer Corps Entrance Exam Hopeful") introduced a nearby shrine called "Utsutsu" near the river. (This is a reference to a Japanese folktale where a demon-slayer named Sou-gintsu is said to have visited a nearby shrine called Utsutsu to pray for success in the entrance exam for the Demon Slayer Corps.)
When the first contact between Burdock and Mitsugi was revealed to be "What were you doing when your sister was eating people?", Mitsugi's response of "It's too late" triggered a fist-slap from Burdock.
Even in the midst of fans, one can find endless conversations and laughter.
If she were to follow behind the demonic sister, there is a possibility that she will be forced to make a judgement in that moment.
Initiation and inspiration can be drawn from the imagination.
We went to the shrine of the poor man Dosun in the mountain of Shirogane, and followed the path until the morning. We descended to the mountain's summit and reached the waterfall.
Before entering the mountain to perform the ritual of purification, it is said that one should make an offering of a stone or a trap.
Despite the sharp smell of the dung beetle's excrement, which was handled with a human's hand, it became "The Prince's Correction".
Even though it was sudden, he was able to avoid the entire body with his high physical strength. However, he was not able to evade the true power of the demon.
Suddenly, people who were ordinary became strong without knowing why, and then woke up. It was because they had been grinding their potential power and techniques up until then.
People who have put in effort deserve to be rewarded, but there's nothing to be rewarded for when it comes to effort without results. The "Effort Equivalent Exchange" is a superhuman power that relies on the applause of humans, and is quite unlike the rule of the devil in this work.

Samsumg Electronics has opened a new "DX" department which emphasizes user experience, integrating home appliances and mobile devices. (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News)
Following the integration of Samsumg Electronics' CE and IM businesses, the company has decided to call it the DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect it in the organizational reform to be announced on the 12th.

A 24-carriage collision occurred in Aichi Prefecture. The driver of the train was uninjured and did not seem to be affected by the incident (TV Asahi News (ANN)).
It has been revealed that the truck driver involved in the crash in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, which involved 24 vehicles, did not have any injuries and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is believed that the crash was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Shimokawa, Hokkaido, and 12 people were injured in the accident.
The police first caused a traffic accident and arrested an 71-year-old man for suspicion of drunk driving. On the 12th, they sent the suspect, 54-year-old Yamanaka Katsuya (name changed) for further investigation.
The suspect in the Nozawa village incident was walking slowly with his broken leg and did not stop until he lost consciousness, which was later confirmed to be the same behavior as the suspect in the Nozawa village incident.
It has been confirmed that the suspect in the Nishikawa case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching the suspect's home for clues and investigating the current situation in detail.

We are sorry to inform you that the power supply for your NAS-use PC has been disconnected.
That's what happened.
Open the window to change the air in the morning.
This is the time for PC power saving.
2.) After a while, the PC suddenly started making a pink rotator sound. I was surprised and shut the PC down immediately.
It is thought that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
I tried it again even though it didn't work the first time.
3.) Did not move.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will blink once and then stop immediately.
After that, there was nothing to say.
If you try to pull the power plug out again, it will just take one moment.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, and try to power on without other parts.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles" from the past has been heard recently, leading people to suspect that PSU is the cause.
We'll try to find an ATX power supply later.

I was able to catch a glimp I have been writing a lot about the importance of self-care lately, and it’s because I think it’s so important to take the time to take care of ourselves. It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and forget to take a step back and take care of ourselves. We need to make sure that we are taking the time to take care of our physical, mental, and emotional health.I recently wrote a post about how to practice self-care, and I wanted to expand on that today. I’m going to talk about the importance of taking time for yourself, how to make time for self-care, and how to make sure that you are taking care of yourself.Taking Time for YourselfTaking time for yourself is essential for your wellbeing. It’s important to make sure that you are taking the time to do things that make you happy and relaxed. This could include things like reading a book, going for a walk, or doing something creative. Taking time for yourself will help you to relax, recharge, and focus on yourself.Making Time for Self-CareMaking
