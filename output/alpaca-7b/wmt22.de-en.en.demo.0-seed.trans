The item cost less than 20 Euro.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the item's value.
I am a large customer and thus it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction so that it can be tracked as reverse-tracking.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs her 179€.
I find it really irritating.
Must I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price or is there another way to get a discount?
I believe children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their siblings.
Nevertheless, I think it's okay for big siblings to help out with the little ones in moderation.
Looking quickly, helping quickly, bringing the bottle etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children, I don't see a problem.
When your K1 is occupied with something for a short time by themselves and it's okay with them, that's alright.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should have to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while dozing off.
It is probably questionable legally.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
If something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether you want to take the risk is up to you ;)
Help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer.
The story dealt with fear and attempts were made to alleviate it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and going to his rabid cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken on by a commissar who, after a short investigation, ends up at the therapist's clinic, where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissar has a small niece who is afraid of fire and will be sent to this therapist.
It comes to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired to go to the place of suicide and to document it and to post the photos online.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where the patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses an anxiety center in their brain and forces them to their extreme fear.
(A woman jumped out of the window, while another purposely rowed herself to death.)
This feeling of fear will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there was a great confrontation in the clinic that had been set ablaze.
That is the rough plot I am sure the book was written by a French author / authoress in the original.
If this action is known to someone or even if someone tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to first contact my husband.
It could take a while.
What steps must I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years, Splinter under the Thumbnail.
A child of four years has splinters of wood under the little finger (outside).
They tried to pull him with a pinch.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work out and it hurt.
When we try it, the child reacts hysterically.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow, it's off to the doctor.

After my coupon was not delivered due to a complaint that did not arrive at my address, my order is no longer valid. Therefore, I will receive my order worth approximately.
I had to #NUMBER#€ out of my shopping cart and order something else, where the customer friendliness was higher and I didn't have to put myself through the hassle of nothing.
What am I supposed to do with this number?
Due to Omikron: Johnson will push for an vaccination boost.
The British government and science are dealing with ever-new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive the vaccine by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to progress faster with the Corona vaccine booster shots than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if it has been at least three months since their second vaccination, as stated by Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his people on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date was set for January 31.
The British government will also provide additional support to ensure the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are accelerated.
Johnson said there was an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so the vaccination should be urgently strengthened.
The good news is that the protection level can be raised again with a third vaccination.
Johnson shouted: "Boost yourselves now!".
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omikron cases were reported in Great Britain, resulting in a total of 3137.
In comparison to the previous day, it was an increase of substantial 65 percent.
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone presenting themselves with pronouns.
I have sent my application.
They received an offer to have a conversation via email.
I will reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated one.
I have googled him/her and depending on where they have a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the email now.
Can someone help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to even step on a police officer's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should try to imagine themselves with Pronouns.
I have five books in total.
4 of them are going.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
It was obvious that the chair had an unseen defect during the sales period.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First attempt on the #PRS_ORG.
It has been working since approximately.
They have 14 days left.
Therefore, I always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 more.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and have the bill sent to me.
The feeling of helplessness.
Warning: I will be writing something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I have to write something from the soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to my professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims don't help themselves or think we can't help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with four people, with the perpetrator far beyond the range of vision and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving this familiar social environment, fear of kidnapping the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, is sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply suffer in silence.
I wish I could help, but I know I can't.
It will get better but it will never be easy.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
What does the Netflix series "Arcane" have to do with "League of Legends"?
There is plenty of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing visual style: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited for the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Ludwigsburg's Derby Defeat at Crailsheim's Merlins
At least on the young Johannes Patrick, there was no one left.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said with the retrospective on the cup loss in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We have still something anger in our stomach".
She didn't relax after the game, but instead increased her performance, as she suffered the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the bare result disappointed the way of appearance.
As an example, a statistic is cited that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple-header rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick's response was: "We weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained for."
Thus, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "What a great game to win again against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like a crowd of 10,0 # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football. Bayern Munich participated in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.FC Bayern MunichThe season began with the club winning the 2018 DFL-Supercup, defeating arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1. Bayern Munich went on to win the Bundesliga for the sixth consecutive season, finishing 11 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Werder Bremen. In the Champions League, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the round of 16 by Paris Saint-Germain. In the UEFA Super Cup, Bayern Munich defeated Sevilla 2–1 to win their third consecutive title.## Players### First-
Despite being allowed only 750 spectators at the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they still had to pay.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best game manager I ever trained", praised Gleim still.
While in Patrick Brown's team their own star players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) self-sacrificed on the entire team.
In the last quarter (22:15), they were able to prevent a total disaster and come within eight points, after they had already fallen behind by 39:59.
Besides Patrick Johannes, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
The Riesen will already be hosting the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday evening (19:00), before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have sent them another reminder.
We had originally registered half a year ago.
Always like a hatchet: Max Raabe will be 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with fresh interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on tour with the program "Good Morning, Lovely Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig, but he had to cancel due to the Corona-pandemic.
Nothing will come of it.
The concert that was supposed to take place in April 2022 has been postponed to May 2022 - "on the order of the authorities", in order to contain the Corona virus.
Even other of his planned performances have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 years old, and his band (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then be able to make up for the concerts they had to postpone due to the Corona pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing and playing music since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - exactly like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is impossible to ignore from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good Morning, Lucky Star" he has been touring since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
We can add to existing furniture and so we can check if it matches the color beforehand.
It still doesn't work, but I can only yearn for the cover page, not to read it.
Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz: Through Enteignment, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates, as it has been demanded in the Berlin people's initiative.
With expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of private landlords, cooperatives, and housing corporations is actually the best protection against monopoly.
The coalition in Berlin will set up an expert committee to consider how to deal with the referendum result.
If the situation did not improve, Geywitz was in the process of holding talks with the FDP in the Ampel government about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent freeze until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in stressed housing markets and the expansion of the rental market.
I will speak with the justice minister to get it done as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to buy something and I realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again?
Will it ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I'll take care of it at the new order.
Thank you for your quick response!
When the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipment take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 people were killed by tornados in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has swept through the USA, causing numerous tornadoes.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, in the USA, several tornados caused severe destruction and possibly up to hundred deaths.
The storms leave a path of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everything had been destroyed wherever the tornado had passed.
People destroyed houses, shops, and government buildings.
Some parts of industrial plants and roofs are hidden in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this could be possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they have sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Will it still be produced?
Has she been completely removed from the selection?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you have to sign in?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I please order the lid and have it shipped to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned the contact form and was wondering if it had arrived or been processed, since I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay for vaccines and change their advertising slogans.
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money rewards for getting vaccinated.
That puts them on the same page as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination today.
Also the transformation of advertising slogans into "Impfaufrufe" - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
He had switched companies over which he had lamented.
His situation is not better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year since.
He had evidently not stayed put at his old job and was looking for something new.
You can do it too.
And that he didn't like you then: whatever.
He found the job, but it wasn't good.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the reservation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm finishing a screenshot.
Good day - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is it also in large 230 cm?

Help with first own campaign
Wow! What a view!
I am currently leading a group of four friends on the adventure Über den Greifenpass and want to seamlessly transition them into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual characters created and I am now writing the initial adventure and stumbling already during the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a village near the Thuransee.
There they should unfold the further events.
Some miles from the village, the hero was supposed to be ambushed by a group of Goblins and lured into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group size: 8 normal goblins, 2 with arrows, 6 with bows and swords equipped.
Unnoticed, the Goblins lie in wait for the hero in a hollow way, armed with bows from both sides and attempting to block the wagon with two spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
2. If a defeat was unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his men jumped in and came to the hero's aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into adventure?
The Goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee to implement many of your ideas and now also have more trust in my stories.
I took the lamp apart again.
And they were back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back.
Can you then let them bring the lampshade?

Will everything be deleted or just the storage space?
I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality of the German Sky has been deteriorating for quite some time now, so I thought I'd take a break with this post.
First, the F2 race was stopped midway through to start the F1 coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and crash had put the time plan far behind the plan, they could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It appears that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky Germany had no choice.
Despite that, it was dumb.
Despite that, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a great job commentating on the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was again a case of rule ignorance with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they didn't know that one has to change the tires under a red flag.
Although there had been similar situations in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was only when Hamilton's team radioed that Verstappen should change his tires that they decided to act.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that it was Verstappen's chance.
I believe one should simply know the basics if they are commentating on the F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first Rätselrat that has had to deal with uncertainties about the rules, both have simply constant doubts about the rules.
In general, Roos doesn't like the artificial comment style, but it's a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition to constant foolishness, which both appear to be unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee with the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
This last one brings a lot of turmoil in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not only does the advertising take over completely on Sky, but in the post-race, it is the only channel that takes out the ads, so you can listen to F1TV without the German audio commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF is doing it.
Even these two channels make less advertising than Sky, and they are free-TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, it does not erase the drawbacks.
The remainder of the programming on Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of the F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races they still have to broadcast, even without the commercials.
Therefore, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it could with a sensible broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, Messing and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have tried to contact the chat twice but nothing has happened yet.
The First Lady said it would be sent on Monday, the second lady said yesterday that she would check and send the email and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS_ORG on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
I need your help.
The fans are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air pumps.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
You can look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can compare the services there.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire facilities can be operated with them.
If one has a large aquarium, multiple-outlet pumps can be used to connect multiple water-circulators.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets depending on the model, and they can also be used to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with a fan (available at our shop) or a decoration that creates air bubbles.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to name.
The MK Series has a special, sound-dampened construction and thus produces low operating noises.
Installation is very easy.
The fan motor is connected to the air duct via a 4/6 mm hose...and it's ready to go.
The fan should be level, or higher than the water level, and installed outside.
If the water level is lower than the fan, one should install a check valve between them.
Just cut the air hose and set the ventilation between them.
This would prevent it, if the water were to run backwards through the pump, which draws the water out of the basin.
If the fan has to be installed in the open, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK-Series are pure power packages, consuming little energy.
Although we have indicated a processing time of 3 days here in eBay, the packages are packed and picked up daily.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to take precautions so that nobody gets upset, just because it took a bit longer than usual.
It would be so that not everyone has understanding for the whole staff that also works in the logistics... naturally, this is not related to the Corona.
Please don't rate us so badly just because the delivery was delayed, it's the fault of the delivery services.
Man is always complaining about these services, even though we're saying...they're having a hard time.
This is also regional very different.
Let's all be kind to each other, stay healthy and hope for better times ahead.
How long does it take to order Gelb, with and without armrest?
Could one also order the legs in bright here?
Amazon founder Bezos is sending Astronauts daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers embarked on a short space journey.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, wearing a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers slowly climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds on their way and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space flight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin didn't share how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
She had just flown along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Also, Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator said he would love to go back to space again.
New Shepard soars up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The detached capsule reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no universally accepted international regulation.
It was already the third manned All-Voyage of Blue Origin: During the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was himself on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second Moon landing spectacle in October 2020, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's Vice President of Operations, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry has.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting and engaging in the lab.
I thought I would definitely keep studying until my promotion.
I am currently dealing with doubts, especially concerning the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one always hears about amazing job opportunities and the job is highly sought after, on the other hand one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
What are you working on right now?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What have you studied/ What kind of education have you had?
Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering whether to terminate my studies and pursue an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have experience, she would like to write about it too.
Extra Stress Before Holiday & Weekend Days
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax from work.
Therefore, it is now necessary to set a post.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
It appears that there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was thus: Last week, it was Ascension Day, which is called "Ascension" here in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses take a semi-official day off on Friday.
It stood last weekend also a long four-day weekend in the house.
What happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
A lot of emails, that had to be done immediately before departure, task here, task there, everything *had* to be done before the long weekend.
Why... ja why?
Why does "then" after so much time sound wrong?
Or because people want to do as much as possible in a short week?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is the reason for this self-imprisonment due to holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we don't get to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above; the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones who are like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know it in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is excited to celebrate Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but still has no gifts.
Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one should drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get ready for the party by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
Catterfeld said, "I love it".
Until the thoughtful days, she still had a few things to do: "For the first time, I still had no gifts, I had to finally finish up."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and feather renewal.
Nekton-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio awards the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the feather damages in bird aviaries are caused by nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of protein-rich material, a properly balanced and adequate protein diet is necessary for the formation of a flawless and durable feather coat.
Your daily diet should contain adequate vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in order to ensure a functioning metabolism.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during the rut are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or deficiencies in vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of Nekton-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
Nekton-Bio is cold-water soluble and can be administered quite easily through the drinking water or through the feed.
Thank you, I found it.
It still doesn't work.
This DDR-Handmade model E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR is a very rare locomotive, which is likely to have been derived from the modeler's magazine ME Heft 11/1968. It is seen with playgrounds and defects in the photos, but it works well. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy goods-electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed to haul heavy coal trains in the Schlesian network. It is possible that the kit came from the small-scale manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is on display and operational at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had 1924 commissioned the AEG to propose an electric locomotive that could haul 2.200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this line.
As the highest speed, 65 km/h was required.
Therefore, the DRG determined in March 1926 over the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with Tatzlager-Antrieb from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered and assigned the numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and eventually ended up on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned until November 1952 to Germany.
It was determined at the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau that all six locomotives were fit for overhaul.
[4] As the need for electric locomotives for heavy freight transport increased with the progress of electrification in the mid-German network, three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the ones in larger quantities of E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred for construction.
First, when it became clear that the repair number couldn't be increased any further, the E 95 came into focus of the repair.
[4]In the beginning, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They arrived in 1960 at the railway workshop Halle P.
They were usually hauled by coal trains from the Geiseltal to destinations such as Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives became problematic with increasing age.
It happened often that Schütze got stuck during routine maintenance.
Then the Beimann, who had to constantly travel with this locomotive, had to unlock the Schütze during the journey with a hammer and a wooden wedge.
Damage to the motors was frequent and resulted in lengthy failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1 # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the Bundesliga, the top flight of German football. Bayern Munich also participated in the DFB-Pokal, the UEFA Champions League, and the UEFA Super Cup.FC Bayern MunichThe season began with the appointment of Niko Kovač as head coach, replacing Jupp Heynckes. Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double, their 19th and 18th titles respectively. They also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Liverpool.## Players### First-team squadAs of 25 May 2019Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Additionally, they decided that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to only have one man operate their electric locomotives, which would have caused problems due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, with the E 95 01 following suit and quitting the service on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating device on the Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time for the authorities of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent initial external restoration with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It had been part of the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden since then as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is on display at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being taken care of in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, with the transformers checked and five motors found to be operational.
The locomotives had been in use on the Schlesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines since 1900, where they proved reliable due to their reliable drive and minimal maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig and brought back to central Germany.
The main deployment area was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in OVP, Functioning well, Optical repairs to the loco may be necessary, Dusty, with Playmarks, Musty smell!!!, Very rare handcrafted model, Possibly from the small-run company Zschütschke and Bachmann.
The packages can bear labels and handling marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of the bill.
The middle beam is being held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle balcony is being held by two feet, these are unfortunately defective.
The middle beam doesn't fit into the intended bracket.
I also get new ones.
When will they be sent?
No, no flats.
According to the instructions, the right parts were too narrow.
But that's okay.
Mainly they should fulfill their purpose.
At me they are not flat.
Could I please get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
A house fire with two slight injuries and high damage.
According to the fire department, two people were lightly injured when a house in Upper Bavaria was set on fire.
In addition, a substantial damage has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
It is believed that the fire had spread from a carport to the nearby house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech) district.
According to police reports, two people were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not believe it was a deliberate act.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
She eventually arrives, but much later.
I still have to pay shipping costs.
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021.
Biotech-CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur then shared a photo of himself showing his Corona vaccination.
Upon hearing that his friend was ill, he was moved to share it with Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him getting the Covid-19 vaccination.
In the social media, there were false information that I was not vaccinated.
In reality, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the social network "LinkedIn".
"Since some months my friends have been pushing me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors".
So far, he has refused it, since the communication was not about him.
But an call in the past week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been hanging for three weeks on a ventilator.
The schoolfriend and his family had not been vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He had not asked any questions about the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences instead.
In the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle has been circulating in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was published by the Deutsche Welle in December 2020, as they clearly stated.
"It is not legal for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," said Şahin then.
There is a priority for vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly gotten vaccinated three times.
Fire in the Substation: Thousands of People Without Power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out: no more electricity and in many cases, therefore, no heating.
A fire had disabled an electricity substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electricity substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhineland-Palatinate had to go without power for 24 hours.
Following the fire on Friday night, 41.000 people and inhabitants were left homeless in various communities.
Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power sources had been in operation on Saturday until the widespread disturbance was finally completely resolved by the end of the night.
The firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their effort.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought about significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their untiring effort, stated Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technologies, in a statement Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would take several days, as the Westnetz-monteurs had to first put some lines back in operation provisionally.
According to the company, a technical defect was responsible for the fire.
Electricity is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are extensive cleaning and repair tasks that need to be done there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt power level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21.000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power back.
Another 20,000 citizens of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were activated in a staged manner at 21:30.
Since 11:15 p.m., even the last ones still affected by the outage had power.
Over 80 workers from Westnetz and its partner firms had been deployed.
The authorities also called for volunteer help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It's important now that citizens look out for each other in their neighborhoods, especially for older or single people, and let the local fire stations know if help is needed, said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the setup and operation of emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were particularly focused on.
In addition, temporary care centers were set up in schools for those people who couldn't take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment, according to authorities.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the roof in Germany was sold out.
Can I please buy them from you and pay in Euro?
It is about the sky in blue and green.
I hope you have also had a beautiful day and stay healthy.
I can't mount the sub-frame on the table.
It is about a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with tabletops of #NUMBER# diameter.
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can't squeeze it in and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return them, since they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive a response.
That is really easier!
Okay, let's do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by e-mail?
The repair is now finished.
I had already tried it before the chat.
Before I bought it, I hadn't restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find it almost unacceptable to receive such a low discount.
With that, we are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination: Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid finished the sprint in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to surrender to the dominant Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return the Auftragsnummer #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
We both made a fresh start and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it appears to be legit.
I want to open it, comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
They report the problem to the customer service when they recognize a file as possibly faulty.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
How is the Chat Connection gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To achieve a uniform and clean color image, you should clean the parts with a little soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you try the first time with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2-3 strokes.
You can do it on the later not-visible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part was simply a stroke.
Draw a steady line beside line.
The slight overlap of the color layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid rapid back and forth brush strokes.
Through this type of representation, unrealistic areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark clouds could later on shine through.
Metallic tones and colors can be finished off with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal flakes when they mix normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry overnight before you apply them.
The models obtain their original look through the decals or stickers.
From flags on planes to ship names to decals on cars: Decals give models the final touch.
Bring the Decals in the right order, while the parts are still accessible.
A flight cockpit can be installed before it is put into the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as a saw, tweezers and scissors are when applying time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut each individual decal out and lay it down carefully.
Decals are also known as "waterslide" images, because you can make them stick by wetting the back for a few seconds until the paper turns dark.
Then you just peel off the picture from the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also pre-moistened).
While you are holding the decal in place with a tool, you are gently pulling away the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check the picture is in the right place before you completely remove it from the paper, otherwise it may stick to your finger, knit or even tear.
You can absorb excess water with a household rag.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book for a few seconds as soon as I look away, then I can't read it anymore and have to log out and in, reload the book and search for the place I was reading from.
I have already communicated with you once before.
Can I get this per email?
Is it for all 3 packages?
For the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Thanks anyway!
I'll buy it then somewhere else, once the money is back.
Will I get it back easily?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
After we had been in Kinderwunschbehandlung for some time, it suddenly became an issue with the payment of the PKV.
One by one.
We had applied for fertility treatment before the PKV and were granted permission for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was thus reimbursed by the PKV.
After some time, we tried to have a second child, and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the PKV yet.
We applied again for cost coverage from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had done more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we handed in the bills at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first offer are lost.
The second child wish should be a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, the insurance case begins with the treatment and ends when no more treatment is needed.
The experts were asked questions in the round here.
Who has the right to the PKV (only three attempts will be made) or us (five attempts will be made)?
Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the contract that a birth would have rendered the further attempts futile?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) will not be healed by the first child, but it is a sign that it may be due to a problem with the sperm or egg quality of the man or woman.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thanks already for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Everything is in order.
We will not be ordering anything from them anymore.
When they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They can pass it on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send it back first.
I can't do anything about it if the dresser is completely messed up when it arrives.
Please take a look at the screenshot to see what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the repayment was initiated, and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment using his account.
We will not do it anymore.
No, the defect has only recently appeared.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal use before it needs to be repaired or replaced.
They must not sell it as a office chair.
Independent of that, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I will take the chest apart and make it available to the transport company.
Good Day, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series.
These products can be purchased with additional purchases, but we are unable to find them for you.
Can they help?
The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture made with little to no money from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of low-budget films on Letterboxd.com, such as...
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What bothers you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.

The delivery time has now been extended, is this now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes with the waiting position...I will give up soon since it doesn't work here.
Hello
The EU has achieved a "half-victory" against Belarus at a high cost.
The EU could celebrate a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, as Raphael Bossong argues.
The costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border with Belarus, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, as the researcher of the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) explained.
This tug-of-war situation - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The way the people at the border are treated is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong.
It appears as if there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by certain EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not been decisive against it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development would weaken the unity in the Union.
She apparently cannot get her way when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is the case with Poland, which has not even allowed Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a price for its policy on the border with Belarus, as Bossong explains: A consensus on the Asylum policy will be harder to achieve, since the line "Border control, border control, border control" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again.
According to reports from Poland's Border Guard, migrants have attempted to illegally enter Poland from Belarus yet again.
According to a spokesperson of the authorities, 55 migrants were apprehended in the night from Saturday to Sunday and returned to the border.
The Polish officers were attacked with stones near Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to reports, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically attended to by a military doctor.
The border police registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
By Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had already breached the border fences.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, of luring them with the promise of visa-free travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have reportedly sealed off border checkpoints.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines, transporting migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent their departure.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, according to Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and proven its resolve to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely to be okay with the security apparatus regularly herding thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has protested the controversial Formula 1 finish.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 race in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suggest two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is related to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen of Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, as he allegedly overtook unsafely.
A second protest was lodged against the decision at the finish line.
According to Mercedes's view, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had come away with his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was performed shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken the preceding car.
I'm testing it.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the support.

Stages in the career of new world champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen has achieved it.

Verstappen finished in Sepang at the Malaysian Grand Prix in seventh place.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen wins immediately.
At 18 years and 228 days, he will become the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates in Budapest his pole position - he is not the youngest.
At 21 years old, he lets Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
Verstappen celebrates his first World Championship title with 24 years at the Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the closing laps.

I have returned the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but have not received any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be, has my request been answered?
Not everyone has the time for your botched chat and wrongly delivered cheapware from China.
They have to fix their mistakes and not all from our household.
You can contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday that I would receive an email with a 60 Euro gift card, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# Nightstand and a return label.
This email has never arrived.
The package wants to bring it still to #PRS_ORG#.
Please contact me.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It is like if an AfD said they have nothing against immigrants.
They will not admit it.
But Kollegah keeps repeating these anti-Semitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, then one should just leave it.
Yeah, then you're similar to little Kollegah.
Whoever seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply lost.
Thanks to him, God has done it all.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must accept that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And thus you are a science foe and not to be taken seriously, like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal viewing field, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to enjoy a practically error- and color-free use of the Lupe all the way to the edge.
Loupes with magnification ratings are often labeled.
These conditions only apply to exact specifications that are rarely the same as the general usage conditions.
To use your Lupe optimally, please take a look at the technical specifications table (see the user manual in the package).
Light reflections also appear on the lenses of all optical devices - even when there is a light strike.
Through a antireflective coating, these reflections can be significantly reduced.
If the glasses are set correctly - a little bit in front of the eye -, reflections on the lenses are less noticeable.
You will find further information in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Hello beloved #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already registered with you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it used to be.
They cannot deliver from England due to the #PRS_ORG#.
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz district are looking for Christmas trees.
Local farmer Frank Diers has experienced many amusing situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man had to return home alone, as he and his partner couldn't agree.
He plants them annually around 2000 seeds.
The 56-year-old has experienced many strange situations.
He says it always makes it a bit more fun when it's the pre-Christmas season.
What about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'll be a customer elsewhere!
At least I received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to discuss what the better dish is, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat, which is grilled on a rotating spit.
Both have their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from tasty.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having difficulty setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly for 50 Mbit download and upload.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these speeds.
However, the other DLan Modul, which is sending out the WiFi, is not sending out the full 500 anymore, but the further I get away from it in the house, the less it sends out (using a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other Modul).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which appears to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Could someone explain why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time consuming to install a LAN cable in that house.
I'm really desperate, so I created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted to receive an answer.
When is it time to switch the Giro account?
Who would have thought it would be peaceful with the Giro accounts, they were deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases with their customers, negative interest rates are also continuing to drop.
The Deutsche Bank, for instance, was long considered generous with a limit of 100,000 Euro.
Now she has halved the free bet and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily accounts.
However, these lowered freebies are now applicable to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
In addition, it applies to both new contracts and "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously lowered its limit to €50,000, which still applies, as well as for the ING Germany.
The recently popular among cost-conscious customers Direct Bank DKB has reduced the bonus amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 Euros, and now to 25,000 Euros.
Despite this: More than 100 banks have according to the Internet portal Verivox already a bonus of up to 25,000 euros or less.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached the amount of €25,000: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there between the consumer centrals, which have won the first instance court case against this regulation.
Now the banks are discussing whether institutions may possibly need to set up reserves - if even the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be invalid and require many millions of bank customers to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty team.
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
Although your life is like a journey of highs and lows.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted "The Hollywood Reporter" most influential woman of the year.
For them, who in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" caused a stir, this success is primarily due to hard discipline and work.
To ensure their appearance, a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are involved.
At least, as Aniston says, she allows herself a chip every day (yes, that's right: a single chip from the bag).
That you can appeal to both male and female fans with the same music is a miracle.
Perhaps because she is just unlucky with the luck - still searching for the big love.
She has removed the baby wish from the list.
Before she was always asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked had no idea what was going on with me personally, medically, why I couldn't.
It was really insulting.
It is to be hoped that even success and fame will make one happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peeled off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight tire wear, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport top-tier.
His wife Minttu and the two children had gone to his farewell in the United Arab Emirates.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand-Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and finished 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the two-man bob - Sports
Björndalen's 94% market share is the goal of the Bob pilot.
"I calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026, the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg said after winning two races in Winterberg in two days."
On Saturday, he fended off the attack from Johannes Lochner with a five-hundredths of a second advantage, by moving from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material settings and raced on Sunday with 0.30 seconds of lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also extended his winning streak to 22.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who was competing for Stuttgart, came in second this time around, placing fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the two-person bob on her home track.
After her fourth place the day before, it was enough for her to join the German triple win with pusher Deborah Levi for the World Cup victory.
Mariama Jamanka from Thuringia, who won the Olympic silver medal in the two-woman bob, came together with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, in second place.
She booked both her Olympic qualification and her first podium finish of the season.
The Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is going to take me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential here, but the timing was okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing ahead, but there is also a lot of work to be done elsewhere".
Jamanka was a bit frustrated by the not quite perfect journeys, but she said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the ceiling already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't cash it in, so I finally had to ask.
Through the COVID-19 pandemic, I had last year quite different problems and no time for them.
And now it was said that he had run out, which really angered me.
They were chatting about the Asare armchair.
I'd like to return it and then order it again, since it's currently on sale :)
Why will the shipment not start until 16.3?
Your website made no mention of delivery time.
No, only when I press the button does an extra field with the message appear.
Your colleague took it yesterday.
Why is it today a problem?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we would still like to have a new, undamaged dresser.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello beautiful girls and women,
I have a lot of things I want to write about and maybe it will help the one or the other...
I am 24, have a child, am studying full-time, and am a Hundemama - besides, my dog is not as wild as other people's.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, has gotten a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand was in a bandage due to the burn).
He is also cold and we are seeing each other less (1-2x per week), which is causing me great distress regarding my needs for affection and love.
My dog is feeling unwell, so I made him a recipe and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit, after I gave him some warmth with the lamp and some petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now comes the fun part - housework - that we have to divide up amongst us.
But even cooking is...
My PTBS illness is currently doing very well, I am halfway through my therapy and am managing to cope.
Not good, but I'm managing okay and almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything, and on Saturday I have an Anatomy class, for which I should at least prepare something.
On Tuesday, I have an oral exam, and whatever comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room for these details.
My week is going by so fast: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then what?
Only until birthday.
Until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am just so stressed out that I need these mental cues, otherwise I will just pack up and leave.
I feel somehow guilty and "chaotic", but I can't seem to do it any other way...
Do you guys feel alright?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinite in my gratitude; I can't express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I believe it has something to do with the mental load women carry and that's why I thought I could find some understanding here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately it is the wrong color, plus texture, is scratched and the tabletop has a print.
The first delivery arrived with the correct color, exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to switch tables now, will I get a different color or how?
The email to cancel the reservation was sent on #NUMBER#.
In addition, twice.
She was not confirmed.
Nothing was the same: I noticed then in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always something strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
How do you stand?
You may also be able to share stories with colleagues and classmates from different perspectives.
I understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the Theory of Relativity.
Why would someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I would like to write in English as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would have to abandon it.
It is good, thank you.
I expect a response by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help please with movie search.
Hello lovely people,
I'm searching for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for youth.
In the movie, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the Modern (real world). On the other hand, the Modern (ideal world).
In addition, the past (or the realm of the dead) is not entirely certain.
Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, he saw a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in the Pirates of the Caribbean).
When their paths crossed for some reason, an action resulted.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who is bringing the woman there in order to live.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other in the end.
If it says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our Little One has only been sleeping on her belly since Week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, go take a look, but don't watch too long, but keep an eye on everything.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ah so and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly?
Is it lying face first in the mattress?
You can draw that conclusion from it.
We have all grown up and when my husband arrived, it was time for a walk and to go, so that the kids could lie on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" here and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20 Euro?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my dresser, which arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the dresser.
I would appreciate it if you could contact me as soon as possible.
The chest is not currently usable.
To be clear.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
I had a great time with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this sender have become too much sau.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still have to go on a large donation drive.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One wanted to be "no running billboard".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser, trying to reach the Elitefan with their BilloMerch.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
They naturally applied to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and is trying to take advantage of the situation with the exploded rented rooms to make ash.
How can one find all of this good?
Great when it suits you, I find it awful.
I would like to return the defective wooden table that was delivered to me.

Darmstadt is second in the Hinserie - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Bundesliga.

Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the decisive game, happiness in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt over the unsuccessful start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
My laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) has not been charging since last night.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power supply would be enough to operate the device.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with an inserted power cord.
After I took the battery out, nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in a network connection?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG to be brought to my room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
We don't know how high the seat is.....

No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
This 20-liter capacity can swallow even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored with the padded FlexFold-Teiler.
And whatever else you need for everyday items is well organized and detachable from the photo equipment in the customizable interior compartment.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalistic design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that ensure the interior of the backpack and yet grant access to the photo equipment in a matter of seconds.
It works with two options: Either conventionally through the lid, which is secured with the MagLatch system, or with an excellent thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal hook with appropriate anchor bolts at the front of the backpack.
Unlike most other backpacks, Peak Design has come up with different "fill levels": There are four anchor bolts, securely welded, into which the latch can be inserted.
When the backpack is full, you take the top beam, if it's more empty, you take a lower one.
The latches and hooks are also magnetic.
That way it is also possible to close the backpack securely without rattling the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photorucksacks fundamentally: Besides the flap closure, there is still a zippered opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with a top-opening - you don't have to wade through the contents anymore!
This clever detail greatly enhances the everyday usability of the rucksack: If you, for example, are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior separately (more below) and thus keep them both separately - and through the two side openings, also access them independently.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday items stay securely in the left backpack pocket and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
The #NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the
The shipping company announced it would contact the customer to arrange the return of the wrongly delivered table.
Until now, I have received no message.
I would like to cancel my order immediately.
I am now writing with the third support staff member, with none of them did I get further than the promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It is then to be expected, when the chest could be delivered again.
Letting him go is not an option for me...
It works.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year had gone differently than planned I couldn't guess and couldn't do it in a timely manner.
However, I do not accept that I, as a customer, have suffered damage.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining objects in the water at the south branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous cities in the land.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt.
Coloma is a fast strategic game with many paths to victory.
You must simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that eventually works for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to obtain additional actions, or to adjust the rules in your favor.
By using these buildings and the dynamic bridge pieces, you can customize your gameplay with finer adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform actions.
After their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it receives a ban!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players will alternately perform actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up camps, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolvermen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The Anpreiser rotates to a new location at the start of each round, altering the available actions.
This will keep going until the Anpreiser has moved five times, once for every location, and the year is over.
There is a shootout taking place, in which the players Coloma have to defend themselves against an attack by the angry bandits.
When the players have contributed enough Revolvermen and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
After the third shootout, the game is over and the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why Children Are Not Tyrannical" Documentary, ARD Mediathek.
CW emotional abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Will Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now leveling serious accusations against him.
Please be prepared, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people have changed their minds and actions.
Our parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never try to gain power over the child.
Our aim must always be to provide the child with space for their development and to set the boundaries as large as possible in a way that is sensible and feasible.
I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discussing the loss of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on their next meeting about the abolishment of the threefold testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated.
We need clarity quickly whether and when unvaccinated people will be exempt from the testing requirement", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of 2G plus from the vaccine for triple-positive individuals was "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus", said Holetschek.
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) promised to present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the next day. - afp
I will also please send the lamp back.
How do I go there best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, however I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can't process any more purchases through my #PRS_ORG.
Advertisement: Ups, there has been an error.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be attributed to?
What you are describing will be referred to as *Awareness*, sensory perceptions under anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is the most common occurrence, followed by seeing images and feeling pain the least.
This is relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections involve operations with a higher rate of Awareness, since the child's protection requires a very deep anaesthesia.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex had it per definition none.
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros can't help us.
These are legal warranty rights.
At least they should take back the defective chair.
It is besides the legal obligation also standard in the eCommerce area.
Please check again to see if they can at least take back the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair then privately.
There, we will also lose money.
I sent you an email which you didn't answer.
The question again.
The order and invoice specify that the item should be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order, as I know no one who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and an administrator.
He wrote a monumental theater story later.
Günther Rühle, the 97-year-old theater critic, has died on Friday.
There is still the new book lying on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The diary of a slow and painful farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, he was told the author had died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "Ich bezeuge hier schon mal meinen Lebensdank".
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most popular is the europalette, a standardized wooden pallet commonly used as a load carrier in the European region.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to the statistics Austria, over ten million pieces of palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million Euros.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually, is not raised.

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received here last week many great tips for the perfect goulash.
There was an abundance of it for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that!
Now I have become accustomed to the taste and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will invest in a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Remark: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going?
What happened to the books or how can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'm still learning.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed via email on 18.01. that the refund had been processed.
But to this day, my money has not been used.
Would you please check it?
Where Christmas ham is still available in Lübeck.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have they already ordered any chicken?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the heat and fat of the guitar amplifier's sound.
This Valve Reactor circuitry generates these characteristics perfectly.
You can adjust the volume, gain, and master volume with the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-knobs to set the desired level and distortion of your sound.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, allowing one to reduce the sound level without affecting anything on the "Gain" and distortion.
It already sounded up there that one can start a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL-Regler when it gets really loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, the entire potential of the VT+ Series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a Line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even with headphones or direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX input, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate vocal coach.
Whoever purchases a VFS5 foot pedal can use their feet to access the sounds, adjust the effects levels, and control the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live action, it's really essential.
With its new powerpacks, VOX has taken another step into the future!
He had seen it at other places.
Do you have the possibility to return the lamp?
Why is it too low for a dining table?
I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get another update in the next weeks, specifying the delivery date more precisely?
Hello, have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a refund or a coupon.
If necessary, I'll find a buyer for the furniture.
If I don't need the item for more than 1000 euros, it's still better to get something else.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (Door) to the designated hinge.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded.

Iran has seen progress in negotiations over an atomic agreement.
According to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, progress has been made in the talks on resuscitating the international nuclear deal.
Both sides are standing on the verge of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", as there had been no agreement even on the issues to be discussed at the outset.
The agreement is meant to prevent Iran from engaging in the production of nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a week of interruption.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is in Vienna in person to observe the negotiations, but only indirectly involved.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - Free State and is now the German federal state with the highest COVID-19 incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen is the only German state that has exceeded the 1000 mark for Corona infections on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in the country, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, there were 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus infection and 16 additional deaths related to the disease within a day.
200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I get it.
Since the delivery is scheduled to begin in March, it might still be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the package and send it with the post, right?
Here I must not do anything else?
That's what I want to avoid, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to pay for the return to sender.
The 8 euro return-to-sender fee is in my opinion a blatant rip-off.
It is time for changes.
The Bundestag has greeted me, I am/StratorDE in the Plenarsaal in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What's the point of this post?
When one looks at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one can observe that it is not existent.
We have gotten ourselves into a winter rut and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
What happened?
It is likely that the dissatisfaction is related to how things have gone here and how we stand in general.
In the last days, there has been a growing feeling that many people are still excited about the federal election.
What we need to change.
At this point, the community is asked which it wishes to extend the life of the Bundestag.
The spark was ignited by u/edizVEVO, who had become aware of this project in the last days and simply found a pile of shattered fragments.
After some back-and-forth writing, a few people from the community found each other and decided to revive the project.
However, I would like to also invite everyone to participate once more, so that this project can have a future existence.
We have created a Discussion platform in the form of a Discord server to exchange ideas and work on concrete tasks.
You can join the server over this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we develop a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but it's not too bad - we've got the Discord at the end.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different hanging device from you.
I put it together and noticed it then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the sky is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Does the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# come in extra-large, such as 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be picked up soon.
And I beg you to do it now.
I have not had a suitable packaging, but I will try to take the shelf apart for the pickup - they need to figure out how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always reach me by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for the installation?
How much time did I have to decide whether to get them or return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
I had a chat with a colleague I like.
She used to live a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, but now she eats meat only occasionally.
I was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought I was helping animals by being a vegetarian, but eventually I reflected and realized I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to go vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that there was a hint of displeasure on their side, but she defended the vegetarian lifestyle and said she knew where her meat came from and how vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "plump".
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, one can get stuck in a corner and conflicts will arise without even realizing it.
A harmonious loving vegan greets you with a loving smile.
It does not concern an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not there on the assigned date to pick up my reports from #PRS_ORG.
Since I can't be there for the funeral, it can't be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup time.
From February 1st #NUMBER#, I will be available throughout the day.
The water rescue station in Lahnstein has been equipped with a new weir, which has been financed with a 45,000 Euro subsidy from the government.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 Euros for a new rescue boat for the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 Euro.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this endeavor", says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The Taucherstaffel Lahnstein uses a Gerätewagen, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill tasks both above and below water in the water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they have come to expect increasing numbers of visitors: The boom of the hotel ship industry on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the continuously growing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, have contributed to this.
I bought a book I could only read 10% of and then the problems began.

Okay, it is then.
I would like to purchase 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first and foremost for taking the time to discuss this, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar role in the executive branch, so to speak, and I don't want to go into it further.
I always find the question of rights and lefts very simply stated.
Generally, one should say that the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should be obvious to everyone.
It is clear that these people then naturally with the lived reality difficult to cope, because you have in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and thus I mean not the overly feminine cliché-gays, because these exist in the executive rather less to none and quite normal men and women to whom one can not detect if they tell it to you). And also on these people can and must I rely, because in doubt save them your life or set this for you.
Although even these marginalized groups represent, at first it may seem comical, my experience shows a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel alienated by overly-liberal policies, even if these policies seem to be intended for them or to right their wrongs, they just want to be treated normally.
One will find there also extreme right, which openly express their opinion or even plan state-threatening actions, which is overstated in the media.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have been in the foreign service to begin to generalize due to negative experiences and to say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also possible that certain right-leaning people may meet up and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it will be successfully combatted and counteracted with educational and political measures!
Germany is so deeply entrenched in international affairs and that is also good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I didn't understand it, so I also ordered it on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not yet sold out.
I placed the order in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany or it is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as my partner firm.

What is an orderly child?
Hello, I've been working on this for quite some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with little free time), but for my entire life I have had more difficulty than success in keeping my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which nothing happens, and then, occasionally, it catches me off guard and I just stand still and clean.
But it is never so that someone could suddenly show up for a visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household just loses to work and laziness.
Our kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get the child to be more orderly?
We have not done anything yet, but it has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me there is no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visit and always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is usable.
When traveling with a child, is one in search of a larger incentive or do they remain lazy?
I'm looking forward to your answers.
An exclusive, new and high-quality cut, providing maximum comfort, a perfect fit and enabling a nearly unrestricted range of motion.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I have completed a software development study and have been learning for a year.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting again and studying social work.
The Problem: I have an anxious (or avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
It means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is still difficult for me to have casual conversations and I think I have become better at it.
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in examples such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something online about it.
The ÄVPS has already caused me problems in my job (emotionally), since it always brings me down when it finds something to criticize in my code ("just another simple thing messed up") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know this by now"/"I'm just making things worse with my questions"/"he has to think of me as incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did they get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for it.
I am waiting for a pickup time.
What do they mean by "return to sender"?
When I downloaded a book onto my #PRS_ORG#, it came with the message that this book was not authorized by you.
Do you have any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my dresser.

How can a office chair break down after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany must be made within 24 months.

The worker's statement in contradiction to the policy.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
Our property should fell a walnut tree.
He also filed a petition with the municipality.
A worker wrote to me, saying that cutting down fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the regulations.
In the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, it is clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Okay, then I always have a sofa without using it.
Could you please offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euro and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you check it?
Emergency: Serious traffic accident near Selb.

Advice and ideas for further career life.
Wishing you a merry Christmas!
My Christmas is not going to be great, because my beloved head is currently destroying everything it can.
Before I go on with this.. in short: I need advice and it's best if it's from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a cross-trainer.
I originally studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain anonymous, I won't specify any more details).
It was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun.
Eventually I had landed in the teaching profession and was sure that it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that was okay.
I'm now at the third "I'm googling other job postings" I've arrived at.
And it's only been half a year.
Before I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can still switch around.
Nevertheless, I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Although it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work to be done.
Before the game, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but it was my weekend and my celebration day.
There I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moments.
I can't handle a family gathering now.
And then there are these rigid structures, which make me even more anxious.
In general, it is fun and from the outside it runs smoothly, which affects the feedback and so on.
But I am totally exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it hasn't already done so.
I am wondering if I would rather stay in this area, reading your contributions, or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, could take some free time when I needed it, and the work was boring but paid adequately and as a team effort instead of as an individual fighter, which is the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if I won't be back here a year from now, feeling the same sense of dissatisfaction.
You notice it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps they have ideas as outsiders how I can get out of this situation, in which I'm completely finished and almost start to cry at the smallest thought.
I will not make my decisions now emotionally, which will likely lead to nothing good.
But maybe your views can help me to at least get a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for now.
Thank you for reading and apologizing for the whiny tone of my message.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since their introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, resulting in a combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" schematic, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We present the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps with a brand new Modeling Engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology) based on the analysis of components and amp-schematics, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely remarkable.
Of course, these amps contain the Valvetronix-tube preamp.
This is based in part on real analog circuits, as they capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier more accur # 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich seasonThe 2018–19 FC Bayern Munich season was the club's 117th season in existence and the 55th consecutive season in the top flight of German football. The club participated in the Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal, the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup.FC Bayern MunichThe season began with the club winning the 2018 DFL-Supercup, defeating arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1. Bayern Munich went on to win the Bundesliga title for the sixth consecutive season, finishing 11 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Wolfsburg. In the Champions League, Bayern Munich were eliminated in the round of 16 by eventual winners Liverpool. In the UEFA Super Cup, Bayern Munich were defeated by
In addition to this complex circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only gush out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can adjust and tweak historical facts on the virtual stage until the sound is exactly how you always wanted it to be.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Self-evidently, she has been refined numerous times in order to meet the increasingly stringent sound requirements, resulting in a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous improved amplifiers.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists searching for a maximum of sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced response to playing dynamics, and a quick reaction time.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the end piece determined the tube-like character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology accordingly.
The 12AX7-tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counts from his older brother Moritz, the Magic fell 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The great main function is also very flexible: with three individually adjustable and foldable Klett-type fasteners it adapts itself to the needs of your photographic equipment and is thus suitable for any kind of cameras - from spiegelless system cameras of all sizes up to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two or three zoom lenses, and a built-in flash.
The larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for other lenses.
In addition, one can still store a lot of accessories.
Those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photofriendly items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, since the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history.
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused immense damage on the Canary Island.
Is the end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest one on the Atlantic island off the West African coast.
No reliable data exists about the eruptions of earlier times.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has slightly decreased in the past days, but volcanologists were still reluctant to make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-run TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
According to RTVE, nearly 2900 homes and other buildings have been destroyed in the last three months alone due to the scorching hot lava.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered in a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, with the damages estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses, each about 50 hectares in size, have been created by the cooling of lava near the coast.
The banana-growing region was particularly affected by the crisis, which had already developed before the volcanic eruption.
According to the newspaper "El País", 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is standing at the door and the children are eagerly awaiting the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to create something alluring.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still manages to bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "Society's Agreement of Natural Peoples", can break away from the routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How the Nikolaus became the Christkind.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas with the gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in various ways.
The background of this still popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have secretly dropped gold into three women's windows to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of giving, the popular German tradition of filling shoes with gifts mainly for children arose.
Protestants objected to this practice because they believed it to be "idolatry".
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther created the Christkind figure and thus initiated a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas.
Since most Protestants no longer take such details so seriously, it only offends a few anymore that the custom of Saint Nicholas resembles the Martinmas celebrations with Martin's singing and Martin's procession still being a part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one can find shoes in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to highly desirable luxury watches, to fulfill one's desires.
There is a great variety of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources confirm a tradition of giving gifts on St. Nicholas' Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the date of giving gifts was moved to Christmas Day.
In all the Christian-oriented countries, there is a cheerful hubbub about who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether Santa Claus or the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve. Over time, Santa Claus has acquired some distinct characteristics.
To his white drunken beard, which is less strict than the historical figure's Assyrian beard, he has a slew of other traits, such as his slew of Rentiers pulling his slew of slews, his slew of slews of slews, and his slew of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of slews of
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas is the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings bring the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has become quite famous.
Here there are not reindeer, but three horses that are pulling the slew.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is responsible for the gift-giving.

The police shot suspected bank robbers near the King's Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London, on Saturday a gunman was shot by the police.
The police said the caller reported a man with a gun who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a car that was eventually stopped by the police.
It is believed that shots were fired and the man was struck.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist attack.
In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace, there are several embassies located.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it's usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow vividly inside.
In contrast, the solar light "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: It only shines in white or colored light (in six different color tones) and is dependent on the sun.
The unpolished, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: As a naturally formed, large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone garden.
He is also successful in the vicinity of large pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of effort: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires no wiring and no batteries.
You can set the "Glow Stone" to any popular, sunny spot.
Two spikes that were delivered provide a stable base when needed.
The plastic shell is itself robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly within its interior, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery charges already, when sunlight falls on the case.
As the evening draws in, "Smart Stone" begins to glow; in whatever color you choose: Six attractive light colors are available to you - in addition to Daylight White.
Eventually, the system will be shut off when the battery level reaches a certain minimum or when it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun appears, the charging cycle will start from the beginning the next day.

Pill Problem
Hello lovely ladies,
I hope I did it right, it's been a year since my first post on Reddit.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again five years ago due to unbearable cramps and PMS symptoms before my period.
Now I would like to stay, because I have to take enough medications that I cannot simply choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had picked up 100 explosively over the course of my last two-year break.
So superficially, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of pause, it never really normalized.
Someone may have some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance- and noise-free, but perhaps there is something I can recommend to someone.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and a skin doctor appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to each and every one of you who took the time to read the novel!

I have tried various diets during my chronic illness and have settled on a sugar-free, milk-free, meat-free diet, as nothing else has worked as well.
It can also be good if it's just the worm in there, but if you have a construction site everywhere, you'd rather not look for anything else that's wrong.

Thanks for the message.
But why only 20 Euros?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the query is at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Referat: Planning of Instruction (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been enjoying teaching since the summer, but I currently have great difficulty planning my lessons in geography in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can only use the chalkboard, textbook and an OHP as media.
In school, I can only copy software for free (which drives me nuts).
I need to plan my hours for now.
We are currently discussing the topic of geofactors and for me, every hour is an individual unit.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need it for UBs etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I construct a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unsatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
A geography teacher could explain to me how to work with the book in a time- and efficient manner.
That would make me really happy.
I would like to please return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have decided to join a new PRS organization membership, however I would like to do it as quickly as possible.
The retail industry is concerned about the Christmas shopping season due to the 2G rule.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter most shops.
The trade complains about losses in business.
He had also prepared a possible solution.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations will damage the important Christmas shopping season for the retail industry.
At businesses dealing with goods of the non-daily need there were losses in sales, criticized HDE-Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1100 merchants, more than 70 percent of them had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off their Christmas shopping.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year has now become a hole with no ground, said Genth.
The traders with 2G access restrictions lost around a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's going well only in the grocery and convenience store businesses and online.
The union demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The CEO said it was a safe thing to do when shopping with masks, distance and hygiene protocol.
Shopping 2G won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required a high personnel expenditure.
He demanded the nationwide approval of the Band-Aid regulation.
After the vaccination, each customer must be checked only once and would be granted access to all shops with the given band on that day.
In addition, sufficient random checks should be conducted in the retail sector - as is already the case in the public transportation system - to ensure compliance with the 3G-rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the shopping center-specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona virus level, with the revenues at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping season," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, they are trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This would include the so-called Band-Aid solution, where the visitors would have to present their 2G-proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to one found in a club hotel - would be able to freely enter all the shops.
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG and it has already been delivered.
The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which has been tried to be hidden with a yellow filler.
It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already returned it to the package and taped it back.

The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance construction, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with remarkable capabilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the light.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and save it.
You are currently using the settings in the Flash storage.
The controller is special because it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lightbulb produces a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120° beam angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively close distance, is excellent.
Furthermore, it is also possible in reporters' situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness almost without affecting the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both a film set or in a studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or if it's installed in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery).
The user's settings have up to three panel adjustments for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply by pressing a long time on one of the storage buttons and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 Functionality, resulting from the ability to run on cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can access already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value in the two display screens (the left one upper display, the right one lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the included power supply.
Installing the spotlight is very easy.
They have a 16mm thread for attachment, so they can directly attach to their photostat.

It was important that the mechanical components were extremely high-quality, so that they could also be relied upon for longevity and hard use.
In addition, there is a joystick in the delivery package.
The delivery package is great, since it contains a bag as well.
You can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sadly, I gave it away and it's too small :(
We wanted to throw a party: Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, it appeared that the recently winless Hessen were on their way to yet another Bundesliga defeat.
However, the SGE then turned it around, scoring five goals within an hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre season start. "It's insane what the boys have done today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN, speaking a "general praise" to each of them.
It initially appeared to be another dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, but it eventually became interesting.
Patrik Schick had scored two goals for Leverkusen to take the lead.
What happened then impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then returned and gave a fantastic performance", said Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who for the first time since the fourth gameweek and his overcome muscle injury was able to stand on the pitch, emphasized the team spirit.
"I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and beamed with joy at the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we were throwing today.
Glasner will now keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but he also feels well-positioned regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we have all the players in top shape in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
Our medical department is top-notch, but also the players live professionally.
Now man wanted to "step by step" progress and remain humble, and to complete the tasks by the end of the year "on this level".
Next up is an away game for Borussia Mönchengladbach in Manchester United's home stadium on Wednesday evening (18.30, Sky).
I will receive a grade for the mail in which I am returning the package due to my own mistake.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect the call, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent again immediately or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order has to be cancelled again?
For me, it would mean that I wouldn't order again since it has already taken too long.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
The German handball national team had caught a few breaks days before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's handball team slunk away from the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after their humiliating defeat against Denmark.
After a humiliating defeat in the World Cup, Germany's DHB team must now face Spain in the Viertelfinale.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent", said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany closed the Group III round-robin with 8:2 points as runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's too bad we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game for all of us", said captain Emily Bölk.
To reach the semifinals, a significant improvement is needed, to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense", said backcourt player Xenia Smits and added: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
From the beginning to the end, not on the same level.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the start of the match.
Mistakes in the attack and technical errors in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on standard temperature and prevented some saves worse.
The DHB team scored a goal after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
The hoped-for ignition was not this, however.
The German women's team was unable to make much of an impact against the aggressive Danish defense - and when they did manage to create chances, they were usually foiled by Althea Reinhardt's strong play in the Danish goal.
The game ended at 3:10 after 20 minutes due to Mia Zschocke receiving a hard foul from her opponent.
In the quarterfinals she can still join in.
The DHB team only started to play better in the second half of the first half, but still came close to scoring five goals.
The already faint hope for a comeback after the switch was already gone after seven minutes of the 9:19.
The Groen-Schützlings sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for the medals at the end of the season.
In the following, the German team was unable to achieve a performance improvement and exited the tournament as a clear loser.
On the sixth day of DACH Advent, we explore the traditions of Christmas time.
In the spirit of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have acquired St. Nicholas' Day and use it as an opportunity to reflect on our family traditions during the Advent, Christmas, and Holiday season.
How was it then at home?
How is it with your\*his/her partner\*in?
Will you also pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best thing for the children?
What is the Stiefelputzen?
Cookies?
Do you need help with your tree?
Is music playing?
Is the gift from Santa, the Christkind, or is it from Oma and Opa?
It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone is trying to make it as nice as possible as a family for the holidays.
Whether it is now firm traditions or even something different each year: tell us how it went in your family!
Could you please send me any transaction number... or else it might help.
Transfer Confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a coupon code.
Just like PRS_ORG, there are also different prices for #GiftVouchers#.
Does it go on with them?
The title is available, I am an impactor in mobile impf teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has been administered in nursing homes.
After these are finished to a great extent, it goes on to a part in vaccination centers for me.
I answer questions without time limit regarding organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does it conflict with the vaccine?").
In my job scope, I have to explain vaccination, indication (person has the right to get vaccinated according to the CoronaVaccinationGuidelines and no reasons that speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, provide emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical office assistants.
In vaccine teams, we often do not have pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but "only" (please, no lack of respect!) pharmaceutical technicians, who can not perform vaccinations (can not?). Therefore, I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Hoodlum" Question: Amberger knows the Solution.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this Bavarian dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" has caused people to think deeply.
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unrecognized by the callers in the series "Host me?"
No, it was not a "man, who is nervous".
And even none of them, "who has to go too fast".
People heard from the TV moderator that it was completely false.
The man from Amberg told of the solution and likely caused much astonishment among many Oberpfälzers.
The audience learned that the "Huidlerer" was a rag, with which someone was wiping the oven.
Antony Rowley, a dialect expert often consulted by the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more widely known Mundart word "Houden".
By closing this gap, a problem was also solved for many who had lived in Amberg for some time.
I have been unable to purchase books for the past two weeks.
After confirmation, always a error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Is Reifenwahl beim Rennrad really so reliable?
I woke up this morning full of determination to get some training in before I prepare for my bike tour next week.
I said, I did and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then that happened, which lurks in every inner city (thank you Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Zach, loud squeak and my rear tire definitely did not want to continue the journey.
Since I couldn't get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with half-hearted enthusiasm and take the first train home.
It was then not so bad, perhaps it is better to get familiar with the reefing again before the bike tour.
I am now standing still in front of a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have to cover a long distance over several days, I would really rather not get this problem again.
Now it was really not bad, since even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who I met when I came to pick up the bike) and he had already described as suboptimal, because he had been riding them for many years.
If I think about having to do a tire change after driving 80-90km, I'm really grumpy :D
Now I was talking with an older man at the station, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplatable.
Now it sounds very attractive.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I'm currently riding my bike and I think I've gone around 25 times.
There are some of them (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend another type of tire for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe-Page seems to recommend my absolute! Liegenwissen rather than the Durano DD.
Thanks in advance for the help and loving greetings!
The driver of the car was killed when it was able to crash into the tree.
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from an unspecified cause against a central island crashed and then onto the wrong lane, as the police reported.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then rammed into a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old plus his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured in the crash and taken to nearby hospitals.
We have all unloaded and reloaded new books.

After the release of our new High End Headphones B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO Series got some new recruits.
The new Solo 15 is called the sprout and visually reminiscent of the great predecessors with B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a properly designed foot is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted to the given circumstances at home.
Due to its principles, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume is a secondary concern but an exceptional sound quality is desired.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate such high sound pressure levels as those produced by a subwoofer.
It does not mean that the SOLO 15 is weakly sounding.
In contrast, she stands out impressively mature and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-end boost.
This is generally common at broadband providers to optimize the increasingly high frequencies for better bundling.
The SOLO 15 convinces with its very clear and fine sound, precisely targeted to the hearing place.
By slightly turning the sound field outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image made warmer.
Thanks to the point-source, the location of each component of a piece of music can be pinpointed with remarkable accuracy.
The suspicious low mechanical losses of the B100-6 OHM generate a hostility that is searching for its equal.
The SOLO 15 adds to our SOLO series not only in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to consider the final look of the speaker at the beginning of the project, in order to make the necessary adjustments during the construction.
If one wants to furnish the housing, the tweeter must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing adds more material.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the hardware store), first a 8 mm hole had to be drilled in the floor plate at the appropriate spot, so that the cable could be run later on without any problems.
With the help of an upper molding, the speaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed laterally.
This opening should be finished with a 45° phase to maximize the interior opening of the speaker enclosure.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get a break in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
They will now be covered with the glue on the back, lid, front and floor.
Furthermore, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The rigidities can be varied as needed, so long as one choes to purchase pre-cut frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
Then follow all plates of the foot, including the two sides, as well as the front.
With a suitable jigsaw or Forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex enclosure and the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a router to round off all the edges of the actual box.
Even the top of the footrest can be rounded off with it.
After the connection, the footplate is secured with the foot of the housing and additionally fastened with long wood screws.
Then follows the marking and drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the connection points of the speaker chassis and the power cable.
After the wooden dust was removed (vacuuming / blowing), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
Therefore, one feeds the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm bore in the foot until reaching the terminal opening and letting it hang out approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loose there.
Preparations for the frequency switch will be implemented.
The corresponding connection plan and the installation manual for Solo 15 can be obtained from the following document: Installation Manual for Solo 15.
After the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is tightened, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet complete, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the dimming according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity is important, so that the + lead (marked cable) must be connected to the + pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is trimmed to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To increase damping, a piece of the damping material is cut into two parts and scattered loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I please cancel my order and deliver it by the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
It is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which explains the higher planning effort and the short notice of the announcement.
But: There will be at least three people in the control room, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still the pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get ready for an interesting night by making some cold drinks, planning good food, and preparing yourself for a long but exciting night.
