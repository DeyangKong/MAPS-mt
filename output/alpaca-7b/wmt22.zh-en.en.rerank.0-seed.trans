The student researchers from Zhejiang University performed at the annual conference and made a great impression on the audience. Their research results caused people's minds to be blown open.
Using air to wash hands, smelling the air to diagnose diseases, and carefully searching for the source of the mist were presented at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these fruits are students, covering a wide range of disciplines such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students began from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical values, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The biomedical engineering team of the university displayed a biometric sensor attached to a smartphone at the exhibition. The sensor was half the size of a regular smartphone.
All you need to do is take a deep breath, and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of your breath.
Zhang Dingyi described how the sensor and smartphone were connected, and when gas was detected, a health report would be displayed on the phone.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market. Common physical parameters that can be detected include temperature and heart rate.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as stone and clay, to detect chemical elements. Its sensitive "feel" allows it to go deeper and more accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Smart Surgical Light: A Surgeon's High-Tech Magnifying Glass
In addition to smartphones, the operating room has also started to use smart surgical lamps.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition.
Zhu Lin and her team from the Institute of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new perspective in traditional surgical lighting by inventing a Smart LED Surgical Light.
Many diseases can be detected in the early stage and removed timely, and there is a relationship between the light used in the doctor's office and the surgery.
If doctors cannot identify and remove all tumor tissues in time during the early diagnosis of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has four light panels, adjusting the spectral composition, to enh A new study has found that the majority of people in the United States are not getting enough sleep, and the problem is particularly severe among younger adults.The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, found that 59% of people in the United States have insufficient sleep, defined as getting less than seven hours of sleep a night.The study also found that younger adults are particularly likely to have insufficient sleep, with 67% of people aged 18 to 25 having insufficient sleep.The study analyzed data from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveyed more than 350,000 people in the United States.The researchers found that the prevalence of insufficient sleep increased with age, from 47% among people aged 18 to 25 to 59% among people aged 26 to 64.The researchers also found that people with lower incomes, those who are less educated, and those
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and the patient's habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash hands: Saving water and feeling cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with towels, and squeezing out a handkerchief, and Li Qui Zhang and his classmates invented a "handkerchief washing device".
As long as we stand on the device for washing hands, our body weight can be compressed and the air can be sucked out.
He was like a person playing a trumpet.
The compressed air that was released formed a fluid and combined with the water at the dragon's head.
That's great, we can finally get our hands clean and dry!
The experiment proved that the effect of the colored handwashing is the same as that of the ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure cleanlin Home » News » News » 2016 » Local Authority Elections 2016Local Authority Elections 2016The Local Authority Elections 2016 will take place on Thursday 5 May.The Council is responsible for providing a range of services to the people of Antrim and Newtownabbey.

Urgent rescue measures are taken when a sudden event happens, such as rescuing people from an accident or a disaster.
After the accident, the rescue process of the car was still in progress. In fact, it was a matter of time. The most crucial moment was this time.
This is the time when we need urgent rescue.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, or difficulty breathing, our window of life would be only four minutes, gold four minutes!
Therefore, the people around you are so important!
When there is someone who falls down beside us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of just standing there doing nothing. This helpless feeling is too frightening.
In China, there are about 300 million people who die from unexpected deaths every year, which is the most dangerous one called sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, 15% of the population is able to be rescued.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, you can survive up to 78%, with less than 1% chance of failure in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is the first reaction of the founder of the company, Lu Le.
If a person suffers from cardiac arrest, their breathing and heartbeat will stop, as will their respiration and circulation. In this situation, CPR is useless.
We must do artificial respiration and external compression in order to possibly save a person.
I discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of mindset to learn emergency rescue quickly, but when the situation happens, they come too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to go and learn this skill, so that we can make timely reaction in the face of emergency.
Even if the situation is unstable, we can still save a person's life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross center. I am registered at the Red Cross center in Zhuhai and I have a discount. Students also have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself 25 years ago. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the list of goals was done several months ago, but it was definitely accomplished!
After I had finished applying for the other exams I wanted to take, I decided to apply for a diving certificate. I had seen in the Little Red Book that there was also a diving rescue certificate, so I thought it might be useful to have. In the end, having the diving rescue certificate proved to be very helpful when it came to taking the exam!

Because I had inputted the code before, I knew it was valid.
First, I will talk about the conclusion. I believe 'The Four Seasons' is a film that can be appreciated from all angles. From various perspectives, it is a masterpiece.
But you have to say this movie is not a bright spot and it's not even the least bit enjoyable.
There are many different kinds of popcorn in the movie theater, allowing you to fall asleep peacefully after watching the movie, and making you feel angry and full of regret afterwards. Just like the monkey on the mountain of Wulao, it can use innumerable ways to ignite your anger.
On this point, Han Cang really is a heavenly bestowment.
The most painful scene in the film is the one where the creature is an exact replica of the monster from the horror movie, with its body covered in seeping wounds and ragged clothing like a gust of wind.
After you finish watching it, you will be left with a feeling of suspicion as to whether there is a hidden message in the movie. However, when you think about it carefully, it turns out to be just a joke.
I find it difficult to understand some simple things.
The place where the man lives should be located in the southwestern direction of the island, and he should live in harmony with his wife.
She wished to go and see the snow in the east. So, her big uncle arranged for a car to take her to the east and she was able to see the snow.
Are old people in China allowed to sit in the back of the bus to see the snow in the south and the east?
He and his father were very relaxed.
After that, this old man didn't have any more text to read.
How did the female owner get the business license to operate a bar on a abandoned boat?
Why did the Flying Car Party manage to finish the mountain road so quickly?
Then the car stopped at the side of the road. The four drivers of the car searched around but couldn't find it.
This item is too obvious.
Why did the illegal flying car party become a suspect?
Why didn't the police report the high-interest loan? There was a special scene in the movie where the police asked the protagonist whether there was any difficulty.
A grown man can't even use a smartphone but is clueless about how to use a room key to open a hotel door, so he forces himself to look for the hotel staff outside the room and sleeps outside the door.
This kind of mysterious and exotic scenes are abundant throughout the entire film, due to the scenes being too explicit to the point that I can't help but recall them whenever I think about it.
The main theme of the movie was not clear, either because of the lack of a proper plot or because the movie was just a shallow attempt at making a horror film.
After watching the movie for 20 minutes, you might think it is a comedy. However, after another 15 minutes, you might think it is a drama. By the end of the movie, you still don't know what it is about and start to doubt yourself.
Most people are familiar with various kinds of movies, such as car chase scenes, even though they may not realize it. For example, if you want to make a movie about a character who is trying to achieve their dreams, you can tell the audience a story filled with both determination and humor, and then show them a cute bird that takes small steps towards success.
If you want to take a love scene, then you just need to be realistic and talk about the frustration between the young people and the service staff in the small town.
If you want to reflect reality, then the most important thing is to avoid unrealistic elements in your story.
(For example, the actor playing the role of Xing Mo in the musical was burned and still managed to sing, but then he was attacked by an unstoppable brain tumor.) He couldn't even go to see some of his favorite musicals after that.
Although she was playing the role of a 5-year-old child, she was able to display her intelligence and charm in certain aspects. I don't know if it was due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I was also confused, why did Han Cang become so passionate about adding a car crash scene to his own movie?
Such arrangements for the movie are stored in the Spring Festival holiday, is it to give the audience a hard time?

The advantages of using hollow concrete blocks in constructing wells are as follows: the four sides of the blocks are uneven and irregular, forming a stepped structure; the blocks are combined with brick walls to form a chain-linked lock.
The brick-and-mortar structure of a wall is far superior to that of a slab in terms of anti-seismic performance.
The module is used for the reinforced concrete structure, combining the vertical and horizontal holes, and then pouring the concrete into the holes, forming a lightweight concrete web structure, which has the function of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is equipped with transverse and longitudinal reinforcements, which can increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition to using concrete to check the foundation of the well and the drainage well, which is easy to cause settlement, subsidence and leakage of water, the wall and the module of the machine is stable, simple operation and standard size.
This equipment is used to check the soil, adjust the drilling machine, and monitor the entire process. It has an intelligent control system and can provide data input and output, as well as a touch-screen liquid crystal display. It can also achieve ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of raw materials, density control, and safety logic control. Furthermore, it can detect and diagnose any potential failures.
The pumping system for the wall and floor of the well consists of single-tube and double-tube pumps, with the former used for transporting and the latter for pressurizing.
An independent hydraulic pressure integrated station, to avoid the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, to ensure the reliability of the hydraulic system work.
Check the soil, install the module, fill the mold, close the door, and automatic transportation of the pallet, complete the whole process independently by the hydraulic system, thus achieving the reduction of mechanical wear and tear.
The equipment should be checked regularly to ensure the stability of the performance. The imported computer, electronic components, sealing materials and hydraulic components should be used to ensure the performance of the equipment.
The wall and floor of the machine are made of a single steel plate, and the cutting line is welded without any joints. The filling box is free to swing and guide direction, effectively reducing the mechanical wear.
Utilizing a mold, reducing the load, filling the mold with a single material, synchronizing the whole process, and ensuring the synchronization of vibrations can achieve a realistic effect.
The vibrating motor is composed of a wall body, a module, a mechanical exciter and an electronic control system. The vibrating frequency is adjusted according to the material's price-performance ratio, which reduces wear and tear and extends service life. This reduces costs.
This machine has a dual-functionality of manual and automatic control. It can be operated manually or automatically through the control module.
Checking the drilling model:
Checking the condition of the well, water and soil samples, and the brick of the well.
There was a corner in the car parking lot of Yixin Company.

The modern apprenticeship system has been introduced in the school. Upon enrollment, students are expected to become full-time employees of the school.
Yesterday, the reporter from the city education committee was surprised to learn that this year, our city will be piloting the "modern apprenticeship" model of human resource development in 60 urban and rural schools. At the same time, the students accepted into the pilot program will be granted apprenticeship status and will be recruited by the trial enterprises afterwards.
The Education Bureau requires that all private schools recruit and admit students in accordance with the regulations on private education, clearly identify the student's status as either a full-time student or an apprentice, and sign a tripartite agreement with the school, parents and employer. For students under 16 years old, a four-party agreement is also required to ensure their safety.

The school needs to reform its talent cultivation mode.
Schools, companies, and the government should jointly design a plan for nurturing and cultivating talents, to jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, and quality control standards, and to implement them accordingly.
A period of internship is set as a trial period for students to cultivate their professional skills, and the internship time is usually determined according to the profession of the student. The internship period is usually 6 months.
In the practice of enterprise, the implementation of enterprise team teaching should be based on the characteristics of different professional groups, with one teacher as the leader of a group of 2 to 5 disciples, so as to ensure that students are familiar with and master the skills needed for each position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to 2019 August, our city will determine 60 city-level modern teacher internship points, the number of each internship point is about 50 people, in total 3000 people (students) will be trained.
Following the principle of trial and error, step by step advancement from point to face, exploring and establishing a long-term recruitment, training and integration mechanism of school and company, enhancing students' employability and improving their employment rate and quality.

Doctors in South Africa: The power of social media and traditional media is strong, but it is mostly used for light diseases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new variant of the Coronavirus is more contagious and spreads faster than SARS.
According to the Associated Press, the spread of AIDS in South Africa has been reported by the South African doctors' organization. They said that the symptoms of the new cases of AIDS are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever similar to flu symptoms.
The organization's overall coordinator Unben Pillay (M.D.) said that he has to see about 30 patients a day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
They can control the disease at home and most people will recover within 10 to 14 days.
He said, this package includes elderly patients and those with health problems, these people groups are naturally more easily infected with the coronavirus due to the weakened immune system.
He said, compared to the previous outbreak of the same disease in Delhi, the new cases he treated had difficulty breathing and had low haemoglobin levels.
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
During the two weeks after the first case of pneumococcal meningitis was reported in the southern part of Africa, other health workers also shared similar experiences.
Although we have collected enough data, it still needs several weeks of time. However, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the new cases of HIV/AIDS were severe, which is half of the previous pandemic rate. The average hospital stay shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent cases of HIV/AIDS, only 3% died, while in South Africa's early outbreak cases, the mortality rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, cited data and other reports to say: “Currently, almost all the evidence suggests that this is a mild disease.”
He said, “We need to obtain the data from the later period.”
Under normal circumstances, the time of hospitalization and death due to the epidemic is delayed, while we have entered the time of this epidemic only two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospital rates, as well as testing current vaccines and treatments.
Despite the fact that the novel coronavirus has become the world's most important infectious disease, there have been cases of outbreaks in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the pandemic.
According to the health department official, the number of new cases of the disease in Guangdong province in December increased by 400%. Tests showed that the majority of the cases were of the opium dengue fever variant.

Education assessment: What can we do to save the children in danger?
If the famous public service advertisement of "No buying, no selling, just killing" is compared to the popular "No harm, no foul" mentality, then in a good environment without coercion, the prevention of crime will be more effective, the risk of harm will be minimized, the cost will be high, and the crime will not occur.
Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department announced the launch of a platform for urgent dissemination of information about lost children.
This is the authoritative platform for publishing information about lost children, and quickly finding the lost children with the help of the Internet.
After hearing the name of this App, "Group Circle", I felt warm and cozy.
The new technology means not only the name "Wen-yi" (literally "culture and art") but also the feeling of love and joy, and the application of information is very practical and effective.
To apprehend the perpetrator and to recover the kidnapped child is the primary objective, to ensure the safety of the kidnapped child and his/her family's freedom.
Only then was it the trial and punishment of the suspected person.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many "big words".
Before breaking the news of a failed sale, one should prioritize the physical safety of the victim.
In times of crisis, it is important to take a step back and think before speaking or acting. Arguments can become heated and topics such as whether or not children should face the death penalty can become divisive. It is important to remain calm and think carefully before engaging in such discussions.
According to the experience of handling such cases, people tend to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the loot.
Searching for a missing child can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The further the child is from home, the more difficult it is to find them and the more challenging the investigation becomes.
Under such circumstances, extracting information from platforms like "Questions and Answers" can be directly helpful in uncovering cases and finding missing children, which is an effective action.
After all, "putting an end to corruption" is a task that requires an entire legal system to be set up properly.
To protect the interests of victims of crime, to safeguard children and families, from perfecting the law to ensuring the security of the law, and from the secrecy of the law to the compassion of the law, we must persist in our concern for the weak.
In addition to preventing the sale of children, it can be done better in the family and society.
For example, a common case, a family of three took a nap at the train station, only to wake up and find their child missing.
As a parent of a two-year-old, you cannot expect them to have enough self-protection skills. However, as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some basic protective consciousness.
The parents and the child took a rest and were protected by the stable environment. It was the most effective preventive measure against child abduction.
From the perspective of the police, cracking down on illegal activities is an important task. However, it is also important to pay attention to the other side of the story, which involves buying and selling children.
Unlawful behavior of an individual is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese Criminal Law, the punishment for selling children for crime is 5 years in prison; if the circumstances are especially severe, the death penalty may be applied, and all the criminal's assets will be confiscated.
At the height of the crackdown on crime, the punishment for minor offenses became lighter, making it clear that the punishment for such offenses was heavier than before.
There are still plenty of shoplifting cases happening every year.
People's understanding of child rearing and education in the family is weakening, and the legal awareness is becoming shallow.
Educational policies should be synchronized and advanced with the development of the people in this part.
To effectively control illegal sales, it is impossible to rely solely on strict enforcement of laws and regulations by the government.
If the market is widely spread, the sellers will be eager to make money and constantly innovate selling methods, forming a confrontational relationship with the buyers and leading to a low-efficiency deadlock.
Therefore, it is beneficial to have a clear understanding of the law, which can help prevent and control illegal activities such as gambling and child abuse.
Comrade Yang Hongdong spoke at the Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress of the 19th Central Committee with a high spirit.
Drawing strength from the Party's century-long struggle, we must strive for greater progress.
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th, the vice-chairman of the provincial committee, the vice-chairman of the propaganda department and the director of the publicity department of the province, Yang Huan, went to the Mao'an Mountain Video Creation Garden to interactively spread the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and learn the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping. They also learned the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Yang Hongdong spoke from three aspects: his own experience, his feelings, and his understanding of the Party's theory and spirit. He deeply explored and broadly expounded the core meaning and requirements of the whole meeting.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches and instructions given by General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congresses, and study hard to strengthen the sense of unity and defense, as well as to protect the "two unities" and "two consolidations" in our hearts, in our politics, and in our actions. We should steadily move forward in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive dialogue, the representatives of the grassroots, enterprises and the youth discussed the relationship between the three historic decisions, the meaning of the "two establish" decision, how to grasp the direction of the enterprise, and how the new generation can draw power from the century-long party history. Yang He, in a simple and vivid language, and with lively examples, answered the questions from the youth party members. He encouraged them to draw power from the party's century-long struggle, to tightly unite with the central leadership, and to remain firm and unmovable.
According to the preliminary estimates, the total number of graduating seniors in the Beijing region in 2022 is expected to reach 26.8 million people.
On December 11th, the 2022 Graduation Employment and Entrepreneurship Workshop was held in Beijing, jointly organized by the Beijing Education Commission, Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, and Beijing Employment Promotion Association. Reporters from the scene witnessed that the number of graduating seniors in Beijing this year is estimated to reach 26.8 million, an increase of 1.6 million people compared to last year.
The person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau of Beijing expressed that they will focus on improving employment matching, strengthening policy support, widening job channels, helping the unemployed, and supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as improving service efficiency in these areas.
The Bureau of Human Resources and Social Security of Beijing Municipality will build an employment platform to increase job supply and actively contact 40 universities and colleges to provide internship opportunities. It will also visit enterprises to recruit people, integrate job demand and vacancy information, and focus on "six-in-one" recruitment, i.e. recruiting one person from each of the six categories - private enterprises, state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, government projects, internship and job experience. It will also provide one-on-one career guidance and job placement services.
In reality, I don't know whether it was the store's fault or my own mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Investigation failed.
I hope you will understand this.
Because the delivery time was much faster than the display, it was 30 minutes.
No need, thank you.
It has already changed hands.

The International Olive Council will divide olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
The oil obtained from freshly picked hazelnuts is called natural hazelnut oil. It is mechanically cold-pressed and filtered after removing impur Home > News > Industry News > China's solar energy industry.....China's solar energy industry has grown rapidly in recent yearsThe solar energy industry in China has grown rapidly in recent years, with the installation of solar panels increasing by 80% in 2014 compared to the previous year.China is now the world’s largest producer of solar energy, with the country’s total installed capacity reaching 33 gigawatts at the end of 2014. The country is also the world’s largest market for solar panels, with an estimated 40 million households in China using solar energy.The Chinese government has been a major driver of the solar energy industry in the country, providing subsidies and other incentives to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources. This has led to a sharp rise in the number of solar energy projects in the country, with the government aiming to have 11.5 gigawatts of solar energy installed by 2017.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin Oil (Top Grade): It is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is pure natural product.
The fragrance of the flower is exquisite, with a gentle sweetness and a mildly sour taste.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil (FVO): The acidity is slightly higher than 2%, but still within the normal range. It has a pure and delicate taste, with a lightly fruity aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Oil (普通初榨橄榄油): Taste and aroma can be maintained, acidity should not exceed 3.3%.
The fatty acid content of the rapeseed oil after refining should not exceed 3.3%, otherwise it will become "secondary oil".
The oil can be divided into two levels according to its refining:1. Light oil: The oil with low viscosity and high API value, mainly used for gasoline.2. Heavy oil: The oil with high viscosity and low API value, mainly used for diesel.
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil in order to achieve a balance of flavor, aroma and color. Its acidity should be under 1.5%, and it should be transparent and golden yellow in color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: This is a refined oil obtained by extracting and refining olive pomace oil through a chemical process.
You should have already discovered that the acidity of the mustard oil is an important indicator of its quality.
The tastes of different varieties of pineapples from different regions and different pineapple cultivars are similar to those of different wines made from different grapes. Therefore, the oils of different pineapples from different regions and different cultivars will have different standards.
The best place for the growth of oil palm is:
Soil and climate conditions along the coast of the sea are most suitable for the growth of oil palm. These conditions include temperature, humidity, sunshine, rainfall and soil moisture.
Excluding the coastal areas and other regions outside of China, only those areas with suitable conditions can be used for the cultivation of genetically modified organisms.
The mainland of China (including the sea) is the main production area.
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, France, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somaliland, etc.
Harvesting Tea Leaves in a Month of November:
From June to August is the time for oil-tea-tree blossom-fruiting and ripening. From October to November, the fruits start to grow and mature, changing from green to yellow, purple and finally black.
November to February is the season for collecting fruit in the citrus industry (the freshness of the orange oil is very important).
The nutritional components of castor oil are as follows:
The single unsaturated fatty acid of the nut is rich in omega-3 and omega-6, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Castor oil has been found to be the most suitable oil for human body nutrition among all the oils discovered till date.
The Democratic National Convention has ended, and the new president has been elected. The fire of freedom will never die out.
The Online Summit for Democracy, attended by over 110 countries' government and civil society leaders and private sector representatives, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
During the closing speech at the conference, Liu Yandong said that freedom's flame burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and no authoritarian regime can extinguish it forever.
He also expressed his plan to convene the second Global People's Congress in 2020.
The Taiwanese government representative, political advisor Tang Fong and other activists from the Hong Kong democracy movement, such as Joshua Wong, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Bowen said: "We know that the work that is required of us is immense."
But we also know, we can welcome the challenge, because I have said before, just as this meeting showed, democracy is nowhere to be found.
The flame of freedom, which is unquenchable even by totalitarian regimes, is burning in the hearts of people all over the world and throughout history.
We must continue to demonstrate and safeguard our democracy with the concerted effort of the entire society.
He said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democracy, promote reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be able to check and balance the powerful forces that seek to gain advantage at the expense of the public good."
The second day of the National People's Congress focused on defending human rights, preserving democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital totalitarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is the "International Human Rights Day".
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democracy movement is facing a great challenge globally, especially with the emergence of new digital technologies.
He said, "This is the time to uphold the shared values and standpoints as well as the democratic spirit."
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality issues, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding women's and girls' opportunities.
This also requires resolute denunciation of all forms of nationalism, racism, and extremism, including the use of all available technologies to promote revolution.
A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, addressed the UN Human Rights Council by pre-recording a video message, reminding and encouraging the Council to continue paying attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other minority groups in China.
He said: “For a long time, the world has been receiving the Chinese Communist Party’s rising, yet without establishing any mechanism to hold it accountable.”
This is why political figures and social leaders must work together.
We must utilize all the resources we possess to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task.
Luo Guanzhong also called for the world to unite against the threat of communism.
He said: "Perhaps some people in the middle fear the leader, perhaps some people in the middle do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some people in the middle do not understand the (Communist) Party's threat to our democratic values."
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Fighting Against Digital Isolation and Defending Democratic Values" held by the Taiwanese Government, a video was released titled "The Statement of the Nation". The video emphasized Taiwan's stance on opposing authoritarianism and defending civil rights.
He also shared his experience of how to build trust through transparent information sharing and combat the novel coronavirus crisis.
He said: "At the frontline of the struggle against authoritarianism in Taiwan, we have remained steadfast and have always advanced the cause of global freedom, democracy and human rights. We have also played a leading role in promoting them."
During the pandemic period, various authoritarian governments around the world have been rationalizing their violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests. This has resulted in a retreat of global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down the flag to fight fake news.
While the second day of the National People's Congress was going on, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for serious violations of human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company for using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

I know that.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time was always delayed.
Originally, it was supposed to be #NUMBER#.
I didn't call him.
He didn't eat.
I will definitely file a lawsuit.
You didn't send it yet, why are you still talking about it?
Waiting for you so long.
I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to send the goods to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.

Hi, the live chicken that was just delivered to the restaurant is very delicious.
I want to try out playing basketball, but I'm afraid of myself getting too frustrated and not wanting to continue. So I'm looking for a place with a reasonable price to practice my skills.
Unfriendly, in reality, tend to be more expensive than friendly ones, if not distinguishable, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap one, such "entry-level" photography.
Their strength was very low, the ball was hit to the top of the net, the vibration was very great, the hard ball could not be stopped, and it was difficult for the skilled players to control it.
The logic and subtlety of net passes are difficult to master, but you can't buy them, so you have to find an inexpensive substitute. Playing around twice will make you realize that it's not worth the effort.
I can tell the difference between good and bad now. That means I have made progress. I will come back here to buy expensive things later and make two times money.
Advising similar flowers will cost you money, buy a used good quality ballpoint pen, choose Prince or Donglinpu's, these two brands are not too popular so you can get a good ballpoint pen at a reasonable price, a new pen for 500-600 is good enough, but if you have a thousand dollar pen, do you enjoy the taste of it?
Treat newbies kindly, but once they've passed the newbie stage, they'll be treated like adults. However, most people, especially girls, won't be able to pass the newbie stage.
The delivery time has been extended multiple times due to the order delay.
Can I help you with anything else?
Delay
Thank you.
Is it true that I already have credit?
Do I need to re-order the same thing I ordered before? It seems like it's not necessary anymore.
You are welcome, you have ordered the food from this restaurant, but it is missing a lot of ingredients and the chicken is not fresh.
#PRS_ORG# There is no reason or luck to say I should take it myself, it's a hassle to ask you to cancel it.
The item under my bed requires delivery, and there is no self-collection option available.

Your phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, name is #NAME#.
You owe me a reasonable swap.
You can, but your horsehandling is very problematic, so it's troublesome.

In reality, there is much to consider when it comes to dressing and accessorizing a petite girl.
The girl wearing the skirt can't be too short or too long, the difference should be just at the knee, which can cover the bulky thighs and hide the plump calves.
If the skirt is too short, it will cause the fat on the legs to be exposed.
When you are too tall, you will feel embarrassed and bloated.
If you wear different colors of clothes from top, bottom and legs, it will make you look taller. When you wear a colorful top, it will make your legs look longer and your bottom look slimmer.
In reality, many petite girls are wearing deep colors such as black, navy, and burgundy as their signature look. Deep colors are a great way to hide their body and make them look taller. Meanwhile, the high-end and elegant look of a black short skirt is also a favorite choice for petite girls.
Wearing the dark-colored clothing, especially the black short pants, will make people think you are slimmer.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear your pants and shoes too tightly, or people will notice it.
As cultural diversity increases, the colors should not be too bright and flashy.
To avoid people paying too much attention to your legs and feet, so that they can get a feeling of being fat.
For the little girl who is slightly chubby, it is important to teach her how to dress and accessorize properly.
Don't wear too-tight clothes that make you look like a stuffed sausage. Additionally, avoid wearing short or too-short skirts or dresses that make your legs look too thin. Instead, opt for a long, flowing skirt or dress that covers your legs and hides any unwanted bulk. You can also try wearing a black opaque tights or a net skirt (with a small grid-like pattern) to further conceal any unwanted curves. Finally, complete the look with a loose-fitting blouse and a classy scarf or shawl to create a chic and elegant silhouette.
Of course, the little girl was also curious about why she was wearing a short skirt.
The fat girl should choose a matching color for the short skirt, so that her plump figure will have an added height effect.
Wearing shorts and high heels can make your legs look longer and slimmer, which is the hottest combination for the summer!
If you are upper-body fat but have slim legs, we recommend you to choose a beautiful feeling sleeveless dress.
Not only can it block out large pores, but it can also show off your advantages.
A-shirt will make you look slim, especially for plump girls. When wearing a shirt, choose a tight-fitting one to form a layered effect and make you look even slimmer.
This simple white dress can be paired with shorts or tights, and it can also be tried by those with a curvier figure.
The girl who was petite was also able to exude a fashionable feeling.
As long as they can grasp the rules of wearing clothes and accessories, even the smallest and shyest girls will become the center of attention.
After changing your clothes and putting on makeup, you should also exercise more in life and strive to get up early to break away from the label of "micro-shrinking" women. Let's have fun!

Girls donating money to help their sisters who were injured in the Sichuan Earthquake - China News Network
A young girl stood in front of a large wooden plank in the Hunan Forest Park. The wooden plank had the words “human flesh and blood” carved on it. There was also a picture of a bow and arrow beside it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl in Hangzhou donating money to charity with the caption “Giving is Fun” went viral on WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a wooden plank which is slightly taller than her, with the words “human flesh” and “ten yuan” written on it. It is meant to symbolize that after paying a fee, one can use a bow and arrow to shoot at the target.
This behavior triggered a heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City, Xiangshan Sub-Bureau, spread the news that the person in charge of the incident had verified it to the reporter of the New China News Agency. The police confirmed that the girl had done such an impulsive and excessive act, but this behavior is not worthy of praise. After warnings and advice, the girl had already left the local police station.
The little girl on the street corner was collecting donations for the charity. She held a donation box in one hand and a signboard with the words “Donate Now” in the other.
While browsing the Internet, a long-haired girl with a distinctive style stood in front of a wooden plank, writing "human flesh and blood, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" in black ink on it. On the other wooden plank in front of her, she had written her bank account and WeChat/Alipay numbers.
This picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think that this behavior is similar to "beggars begging for food", and there are also many netizens who express their sympathy.
We arrived at the square at around 10am when we noticed the situation. By then, the crowd had already dispersed.
The police station near the scene of the incident accepted the media's interview, and the two female teenagers were dressed up in a youthful and beautiful manner, with one of them being around 20 years old.
A girl was crying in the middle of the road, begging the people around to play the game with her. Another girl was standing beside her, helping her drink and talking about her sick sister, who needs an urgent surgery fee. Please help them.
We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl is raising money for her sister, who has leukemia.
Last night, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City Xiaoshan Branch informed the Xinhua News Agency reporter that the girl's name is Jiaqi Li, and she is 11 years old. She had donated money to help her sister, who is also named Jiaqi Li.
Although the treatment still requires a lot of money, people were too busy to think of a good way to donate or contribute. Therefore, they resorted to such behavior.
He said, throughout the entire process, two girls acted as lookouts, one responsible for handling the gun and the other taking pictures, but neither of them were involved in the actual shooting and no one discovered them until after the fact when the pictures were uploaded to Weibo.
After the regulations were issued, the department was put under control, and the bow and arrow used by the guards did not belong to the management scope.
The person in charge expressed that "We do not encourage taking this kind of donation approach."

What will be the hottest year in 2021?
The Beijing Olympics was undoubtedly the biggest event of the year.
Do you think only the Olympic athletes in good health can win the awards?
The article "Quick Look! An Olympic Project Manager Can Crush Any Giant Brand" in the front section of the newspaper was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can always be the first to act and no one can match them in their daily routine of shifting bricks, taking risks, and working overnight. They also have the skills to save fires, bake pizzas, and face any challenges.
This article is like a funny joke, but it also reflects the daily struggles of project managers and their bitterness towards current project management work.
Employees who are involved in project management work are gradually choosing to relieve their work stress by taking some action.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certified professionals increases every year, more and more project management professionals are able to enhance their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the 'China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)' published by the Project Management Institute, the total number of people who have taken the PMP® exam in China has reached nearly 60 million, with a pass rate of around 42 million people, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certification holders.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing steadily, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on simple and straightforward approaches can no longer bring success. The ever-changing work environment makes us realize that we need to learn and explore new paths.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can one guarantee project management work will be smooth and hassle-free?
Many beginner project managers expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they were able to gain a systematic understanding of project management's ten major domains and five process groups, however, when it came to actually managing projects, they still felt like they were wading through a sea of fog.
Many project managers frequently feedback the following problems: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, absence of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and workflow support, work becomes unstable, unpredictable, and lack of control; unclear division of labor, team members are not clear about their roles, and "old oil barrel" phenomenon is difficult to address; lack of cross-departmental collaboration, poor communication, and slow progress.
As a result, our focus on product innovation and development management has helped numerous excellent companies to nurture and grow their product managers and project managers, as well as to win the honor of “China’s Corporate Development Management Talent Training Base” and “Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Course”.
This is an online course for project managers, which combines real-world case studies, tools and methods from various development-oriented companies, to help you grasp the essential knowledge and standards of project management, and take your own project management to the next level.
This is also an opportunity to let businesses use lower costs and less investment, to promote project managers' training process, and bring efficient operation results to the company.
With confidence, you can first observe other students' evaluations of this course: This course is not only taught by the Central China-Huawei-Summer team (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines advanced project management theories and real business scenarios from renowned companies. It provides in-depth and shallow explanations of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, abundant form templates to help students convert the contents learned in class into real-world applications.

Advertisers should lead the rational consumption of consumers before and after the Spring Festival - Economic Observation Network － Professional Economic News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" online shopping business transaction volume has reached 1.77 trillion yuan, exceeding last year's record.
The Chinese government has been giving out large amounts of red envelopes to stimulate consumption, leading to a surge in consumer spending. This has caused a lot of excitement among the people, but it has also made us reflect on the implications of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer culture.
Before coming to the "Double Twelve" shopping festival, the Zhejiang Xinxiang Consumption and Finance Company (shortened to "Zhejiang Xinxiang") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the public, especially young people, to build good consumption habits and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the 2020 Consumer Financial Wellness Report released by the People's Bank of China, the national consumer financial wellness index was 66.81, higher by 2.04 than in 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese citizens in terms of financial consumption is better, but there is still a large difference in terms of financial behavior and skills. We need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Older people and younger people have a low financial literacy level, which is a major challenge for financial education. The report published by Norilsk Research and Central Television's Economy Report showed that young people have a huge consumption potential, and credit and debit products have become an important way for young people to upgrade their consumption. Nearly 87% of young people have no debt, but some of them have excessive consumption and risk-taking behavior, which has attracted the attention of the outside world. However, some young people have excessive consumption, following the trend and behaving recklessly, which has led to the accumulation of too much financial pressure and risk, and even caused social problems to gradually increase. Financial institutions should be brave and take up the social responsibility. They should provide correct guidance in a positive direction.
As a long-term, stable financial institution, we are committed to providing quality and caring services to help people build a happy life. We advocate responsible consumption and encourage people to make rational and reasonable consumption decisions. We also strive to improve the quality of consumer services and increase the sense of responsibility of consumers, especially young people.
During the past few years, we have been dedicated to promoting financial literacy among young people in China through various activities, such as organizing the China Financial Literacy Competition and partnering with top universities to launch innovative practices and creative activities. These initiatives have helped to cultivate rational consumption habits and reasonable financial planning among young people, thus enabling them to accumulate wealth throughout their lives.
Twelve steps have been taken to reach this place. We should be aware of our consumption habits and spend our money rationally and prudently. We should also resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid taking loans to buy things that are not necessary. This will help us to safeguard our own interests and maintain a healthy economy in the future.
When consuming, you must plan ahead of time and pay on time to avoid penalty. Amount and force of payment will determine the credit score.
If you miss the deadline, the missed deadline record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may cause adverse effects on your future car buying and house buying activities.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and check whether relevant institutions have the required business license.
In the future, we will build a reliable and trustworthy consumption financial system and update it continuously, providing tailored services to meet the diversified needs of consumers and helping them to improve their financial knowledge and sense of moderation in borrowing. We will also help them to cultivate a rational attitude towards consumption and develop a long-term partnership with them.

The People's Daily Online - The South China Sea Cooperation Committee Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover station of the King of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, includes the countries of Aman, Al-Arab League (Aleppo), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that, this was the first time in 2017 that the President of Mongolia, Kh.Battulga, visited Kuwait. The visit was significant as it was the first high-level visit from Mongolia to Kuwait since the imposition of the ban on Iranian vessels in the Arabian Gulf in 2017, which had led to a worsening of the maritime security situation in the region.
In this critical moment, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain and Egypt have broken off their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive ban on its transportation, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations and having a close relationship with Iran.
The strained relations between China and the United States has had a negative impact on the internal cohesion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its economy.
Four Arab countries have blocked the overland, sea and air routes to Kuwait.
The crisis was only solved at the 2021 January meeting of the China-Pakistan Maritime Cooperation Committee in Beijing, when the respective countries signed an agreement to ease tensions and move towards “cooperation and stability”.
Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan reopened their border.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are currently working to restore their relationship with Kuwait after appointing new ambassadors.
The Chinese government is committed to resolving the disputes in the South China Sea with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in order to restore and maintain the relationship between China and ASEAN for the sake of mutual benefits and regional stability.
During the visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to the UAE, both sides agreed to open two coastal roads connecting the two countries.
The 725-km-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of the two countries' citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia-China Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion US dollars in the port of Aden, Yemen, and sign a memorandum of understanding worth 300 billion US dollars with Chinese companies.
The Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement between Iran, the United States, and five other world powers to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. However, some Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, opposed the deal, claiming that it was not effective in resolving the Iranian missile issue. Thus, they initiated a series of talks to renegotiate the deal.
Each coastal country has always considered Iran as a long-term rival and perceived Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country in the region considered the issue of Iran's missile activities as a problem that could not be resolved, and failed to take any action to contain Iran's activities in the region. This was a dangerous weakness.
In the wake of the failure of the talks between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program, Saudi Arabia and Iran began direct negotiations.
The goal is to tame the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the growth of national economy in the Pearl River Delta.
The first meeting of the Conference on the Law of the Sea will be held in Cancun, Mexico, from November 29 to December 3, 1982, to end the long-standing disputes between some member states and Costa Rica.
This is an opportunity to promote the recovery of the Gulf Cooperation Council and to make a contribution to its unity, through various measures, in order to effectively address common challenges and to ensure the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

The sound of people running in the New Mountain District was the loudest!
This car we brought for you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the motorcycle is near 200 million yuan, and the road tax for one year is about 10,000 yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because you have the power of 700 horses, can you imagine how fast it can be?
Even the editor doesn't know, the data shows that it needs only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably faster than myvi's 30km/h speed.
The low-slung car seats, the tinted windows and the giant intakes at the corners of the car, as well as the glass-covered engine bay, perfectly capture the essence of the Lamborghini Aventador.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much. Just Google it and you'll find some helpful information. We have compiled some of the Google results for your convenience!
Everyone is watching the same thing, but it's so interesting that no one wants to look away! (It's kind of cool!)
It costs about RM1 for 1km of petrol. (The car owner doesn't really care about it.)
The posture and strategy of driving a car should be practiced regularly, otherwise it will be awkward and difficult to get out of the car. (Because it will be hard to get out of the car if you don't practice the posture and strategy regularly)
The sound of the engine was too loud, so I had to turn down the volume of my ears after getting off the car. (But it was still very comfortable.)
The car was too big to park in the ordinary parking lot, and it was very narrow. I was afraid of being hit by the car when the gate opened.
There was a bit of loneliness because there was no one on the road (I was talking to the driver, nothing to do with the car).
Don't make a mistake, this video's super fast running has nothing to do with selling. We apologize!

The car accident was worth millions of dollars!

Allowing University Spirit and Spirit of the Times to Resonate in Unison - New China Net
The spirit of a university is to pursue a series of learning concepts and values ​​over a long period of time in the development process, which is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of the university has been instrumental in the progress of politics, economics, culture, technology, and society, becoming increasingly important for the advancement of a nation.
From the first modern university in the world, the University was born with a unique mission and spirit, different from other social organizations. For the University, the rise of the national crisis was the beginning of its glorious history. Its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the values of "righteousness, harmony and peace" and "strengthening the nation" with a patriotic love for the country.
The trend of internationalization and informatization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, leading to fierce global education competition, technology competition and human resource competition. This provides the higher education industry with a great opportunity and challenge.
The proposal of "Integrated Development of World-Class University and World-Class Academic Disciplines" was particularly highlighted in the report, which showed the Chinese people's confidence and determination to make progress in higher education and to build world-class universities and disciplines. It also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we quickly climb to the top of the world within a short time frame, based on the existing gap between us and the world's leading universities and disciplines? How can we realize the "Fast-track Supercar" project?
In addition to having faith in the target, path, and ability, a college should also fully exploit the three advantages: first, by continuously introducing outstanding scholars from abroad, it can learn advanced experiences from world-renowned universities; second, by inheriting the profound wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, it can promote the development of its excellent traditional culture; third, by taking advantage of the superior system of socialist countries, it can strengthen the motivation of the target, unite the strength, and improve the image. Furthermore, it can optimize the resource arrangement and provide a solid foundation for rapid growth.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that building a world-class university requires the presence of many campuses, while each school should highlight its own advantages and features at the same time.
China's special feature is that it must have both a collective spirit and individual uniqueness. It must manifest its own tradition and resources to achieve its own distinctive goals and objectives.
With respect to Zhejiang University, we have been emphasizing three distinct features in our study: first, we are dedicated to nurturing innovative and entrepreneurial talents, and constructing an integrated education and business environment; second, we are pushing for the optimization of academic disciplines, and creating an institutional environment for cross-discipline collaboration; third, we are devoting ourselves to building a comprehensive study and social service system, and deepening international exchanges and cooperation.
During this process, it is especially important to remain steadfast in the university spirit, so that the university spirit can resonate with the spirit of the times in harmony.
For Zhejiang University, the core values of “seeking innovation”, “hard work, moral integrity, clarity of thought, and rigorousness” form the foundation of its spirit, which is further enhanced by the shared vision of “maritime silk road, opening up a new era, and building a strong nation”.
This is a school which has been persisting in the right direction of study, accumulating culture and refining spirit continuously, thus providing important safeguards to its inner strength and profound meaning.
The first emphasis is to open up and embrace a spirit of inclusiveness, manifesting in the pride of being a "world-class university" for nurturing talents. The second emphasis is to pursue excellence and integrity, exemplified by the perseverance of Tao Xingzhi and Liu Heng in their pursuit of truth and moral integrity. The third emphasis is to innovate and reform, encompassing both knowledge-seeking and technological innovation, as well as a commitment to national revitalization.
This series of spiritual pursuits and values pursuit is the soul of Zhengzhou University 120th anniversary celebration.
A wise man hears the sound of silence, while a brilliant man sees the unseen.
China's higher education should seize the opportunity to further consolidate its position in the global market, and take the historical mission of the higher education as its own responsibility. It should strive to become a world-class university.
At the same time, we should safeguard both humanistic values and national independence, allowing the university spirit and the spirit of the times to collide and stimulate each other, thus providing inexhaustible energy for the realization of national prosperity and ethnic revitalization.

I saw some news about the stock price of my friend's company, and the greatest feeling I had was the selection of the industry they chose to invest in - the stock market. Firstly, they should choose a large growing industry, with a market size of at least 1000 billion yuan or more. Secondly, they should select a promising industry with good growth potential in the future, considering the industry's growth potential in the next 3-5 years. Finally, they should choose an industry with stable policies.
The size of the market and the stage of industry development are the two factors that determine the width and length of the competitive landscape. A flat or mountain-like competitive landscape depends on the market and industry's competitive situation.

On October 12, 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, marking the first time a cryptocurrency ETF has been approved for listing on a US exchange. This further expands the opportunities for investors to access the cryptocurrency market and diversify their portfolios with alternative assets.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14th, 2021, the Bitcoin network underwent a soft fork named “Taproot”, which increased the network's anonymity and reduced transaction data load by changing the block's data structure.

A group of students from minority ethnic backgrounds in Yunnan Province filed a complaint against the local government for discrimination in the recruitment of teachers.
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice Department, protesting the discriminatory admissions processes of three universities - University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University - in their recruitment of students.
The Asian-American Education Alliance held a news conference in Washington D.C. on the same day to initiate a complaint against the Trump administration.
The Asian American student population at three top US universities has grown exponentially over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian Americans at these universities has remained largely the same.
Research has shown that these universities in the so-called "holistic admissions" process of recruitment, "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants.
According to the research done by Zhao Yukun and others in 2014, the rate of admission of Asian applicants was the lowest among all racial and ethnic groups in these three universities.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all the schools in the Chinese American Student Recruitment Consortium, Berkeley and Dartmouth have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while UCLA and Brown have implemented race-based affirmative action for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told the reporters from the Chinese Embassy that they hoped the US Department of Education and Justice would launch an investigation and take appropriate measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asians after the fact was confirmed.
They also hoped that the school would take active measures to address this issue, and change its recruitment policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three schools involved in the lawsuit have yet to respond.
The Asian-American Education League was established in 2015, when it had filed a lawsuit against Harvard University for racial discrimination in its admission process. However, the U.S. Department of Education had rejected the league's complaint for procedural reasons.
This includes participants from outside the United States Chinese American Association, as well as participants from the United States Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Filipino American communities.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building in Yuzhong Town, Zhejiang Province from the real estate agent. After multiple visits to the site, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory building.
On the same day, Mr. Liu purchased a house and signed the property ownership rights with his family. After that, they negotiated with the seller and transferred the money through the bank. Finally, they got the house with a down payment of 20 million yuan.
Lin Xingyi signed as the collector of the deposit on the contract of the factory, where it was clearly written, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer within one week after signing the factory purchase and sale contract."
However, after extensive negotiations on the scope of the sale, the payment method and other major contract terms, the buyer and seller were unable to reach a consensus, resulting in a delay in signing the contract.
After considering that both sides failed to reach an agreement on the content, Ling took back 20 million yuan as a deposit from Liu and returned it to him after several days.
It was quite difficult to see the house in the middle of China, but the money had been exchanged, the down payment had been made, and all the paperwork was in order. However, the buyer suddenly refused to sign the contract, which made the seller feel helpless and angry.
In order to do this, Luo Xinsheng brought a lawsuit against Liu Yongxin in the People's Court of Yucheng City.
The court held that both parties failed to sign a formal contract, and thus the case should be settled as a commercial dispute. Therefore, the plaintiff should not be awarded any damages, and the defendant should not be held liable for any breach of contract.
After the verdict was announced, the plaintiff raised an appeal.
The Supreme People's Court recently upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer's Warning] In the trading process, we should be prudent and cautious, paying attention to our duties and obligations.
When signing the contract, it is necessary to be prudent and attentive, such as verifying the identity of the property owner and whether the property has been occupied by others, and clearly specifying the time and place of payment in the contract to avoid any potential disputes between the two parties.
After the conclusion of the German-Chinese People's Forum, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Saturday (December 11th) made a statement that the United States had organized the "Leaders' Forum on Democracy" which was "to caricature democracy, weaponize it, fake it, and stir up internal contradictions within the country".
The Chinese government regards the U.S. as a major source of instability in the world. It believes that the U.S. has been aggressively promoting its own political system and values, trying to strengthen them over the long term, while weakening the multilateral system and undermining the existing international order. This has caused serious consequences.
'Democracy' has already become a 'large-scale killing weapon' of the United States interfering with other countries.
This time the Summit was to fulfill the pledge of the election campaign.
The meeting was to be held over two days and was to be conducted via video. 111 global leaders were invited, including Taiwan's leadership, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the SCO summit, China and Russia accused the United States of interfering with the SCO summit and denounced the United States for lacking the qualification to host such a summit.
There are also suspicions of ulterior motives in the international arena, such as criticism of invitation and participation of some authoritarian leaders, e.g. from Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubt the true intention of the government is not for democracy but for geopolitical purpose of organizing this summit.
The German Federal Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen also attended the video-conference of the China-EU High-Level People-to-People Dialogue.
The statement made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, June 1, 2019, was that "Today's American-style democracy is on full display, with its glaring manifestations of money politics, personal politics, extreme polarization, political chaos, social fracturing, and inter-racial tension." American democracy is a "rich people's game" built on a capitalist foundation.
During his speech, President Obama expressed, "As the leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to fortify our democracy, to advance reform, and to resist the lure of authoritarianism and the forces of intolerance."
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation and in my view, this is our generation's defining challenge."
After bowing, he said, "The challenge of defending global democracy and human rights is a daunting one, and it requires courageous champions to safeguard it."
The United States has pledged to expand its action plan for one year after the upcoming democracy summit, including a proposal of $4.244 billion in funding to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
Before the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Chinese government made specific public promises to improve its democratic system in order to show its commitment to democracy.
We pledge to work for a better future for all countries, and to report our progress next year.
He was so kind that he only feared he had sent the wrong address.
Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
Environment: Regulations and Services [Food Ring] Food: Dishes are served quickly [Old-fashioned desserts] My must-try dishes [Mala cake] Too sweet, too soft, too good to resist [East-West cuisine] Thick, rich and delicious [Sichuan cuisine] Mala cake is too fragrant and too soft to resist. You must try it with your friends who love sweet snacks.
The flavor of the dish is great and the meat is delicious. The service is enthusiastic.
It's been so long since I last came to Xiangshan. The fruits I picked were so delicious to drink and the real materials I used to make the dumplings were so fragrant. The first time I tasted the steamed buns was my favorite Sichuan flavor!
The degree of dryness of the steamed buns was just right, the quantity was very satisfactory, the paper wrapping was crisp and the chicken wings were juicy and tasty. The soup was also delicious, the garnishes were fresh and the flavor of the dumplings was quite good. Overall, the meal was quite enjoyable.
People praise our delicious food and warm service. Our meat is especially good.
The old store in Changsha has been around for many years. It is located in a small alley, made of wood and concrete.
The wait for the dumplings was interminable, and when we finally got them, the dumplings were cold and the sandwiches had split open...
It has been several years since I last visited Chengdu to taste the Sichuan cuisine. The variety of small restaurants serving Sichuanese dishes has since grown significantly, dispersing the customer flow.
It is hard to get a seat at the restaurant even if you are lucky enough to go there. The food quality is not good, so it is better to go somewhere else.
People praise the flavor of meat, and it is a favorite dish.
They are selling goods outside the shop.
The food was a bit disappointing this time.
Three bowls of chicken: The vegetables were a bit too much, but the chicken was slightly lacking.
The taste of this dish is a bit off, the sourness of the base flavor is not enough, so it is overpowered by the sweetness, so everyone can adjust the flavor by adding various seasonings and herbs to the vegetables...
What is the significance of the "red card" in Chinese culture?
Everyone's hobbies are different; some people love collecting, some people love eating, but of course there are also people who love drinking, such as William Grant & Sons's Glenfiddich, which is currently the most popular Scottish single malt whisky and has also won international gold medals.
Every single bottle of red wine has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you might have missed the chance to enjoy its delicious aroma.
What kind of beverage should we drink to go with the red envelope?
The editors have prepared a simple introduction for you all.
The fierce warrior drank a toast with his red badge of courage.
The fragrance of the incense is a blend of rich and robust aromas of sandalwood, patchouli and traditional Chinese herbs. It has a deep and exotic flavor with a sweet and smoky taste.
The entrance was filled with the sweet smell of alcohol, accompanied by the fragrance of fresh grass and the heavy aroma of tobacco.
This liquor can be directly mixed with ice and used for drinking, or it can be mixed with the favorite drinks to make a delicious cocktail.
The popularity of Kweichow Moutai has been increasing rapidly in the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the people, Kweichow Moutai has been combined with various flavors of beer, snow-white wine, or new-style liquor, becoming a kind of fashionable and long-lasting drink.
These sweet-tasting beverages, besides being able to harmonize with sour and bitter flavors, can also bring visual and sensory pleasure when added to drinks, resulting in a refreshing and wine-like change in the flavor of the drink.
The combination of Red Panda, Wild Sichuan Peppercorn, and Ginger (or Sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink Chinese tea.
The aroma of Sichuan peppercorn is slightly bitter and acidic, but when combined with sugar it will neutralize the bitterness and give the liquor a clean and refreshing fragrance. Of course, the sweetness level can be adjusted according to one's personal taste.
The three best ways to drink wine are as follows: the French way, the German way, and the Italian way. Everyone can use these methods as references and try them out. We hope that this introduction from the editor can help you.
Thoughts on Education: How to Make University Examinations Easier for "Examination Superstars" and "Examination Disasters"The Chinese education system has been undergoing a period of reform and adjustment in recent years. The focus has been on making education more student-centered and encouraging creativity and critical thinking. This has led to a shift in the way students are assessed, with university entrance exams becoming increasingly important.University entrance exams are a source of great stress for many students, particularly those who are aiming for the top universities. This can lead to students feeling overwhelmed and anxious, which can affect their performance. For those who are already struggling academically, the pressure of exams can be too much and lead to a downward spiral in their performance.The key to helping students cope with the pressure of exams is to provide them with the right tools and resources. This includes providing them with the skills and knowledge to manage their stress and anxiety, as well as giving them the opportunity to practice the skills they need to succeed.One way to do this is to provide students with a better understanding of the exam process. This includes helping
Three students from Lanzhou University sent a letter to the school leadership, expressing their frustration with the difficulty of the university entrance exam and proposing measures to make the exam more challenging and transform the test type to truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
For a long time, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" in China.
At the university campus, students came from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of study, making the learning situation diverse and unique.
For a group with such diversity of characteristics, there will be different feelings, and it is difficult to avoid.
Of course, if the test is too simple and repetitive, the experience will be completely different.
Students who don't use their strengths may be able to achieve good results by focusing on their studies right before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may be able to get better results with half the effort.
When you come here, you will find yourself in a dilemma: either you have to invest a lot of time and effort to get good grades or you can just coast through without putting in much effort. This is because the amount of effort you put in determines how good your grades are.
As seen, the issue of students facing difficulty in university entrance exams in China is not limited to Lanzhou University. We believe this is a problem existing in many universities in China.
From this layer of meaning, we should write a congratulatory letter to the three students who passed the exam.
In reality, many people who have passed university have become clear about how to prepare for the exam, seek various methods from teachers to "extract" questions, compete to narrow the exam range, and even seek "precious guidance" during the examination. Furthermore, during the examination, some people even carry small notes and seek the help of teachers after the examination. This is not a rare phenomenon.
As seen from the perspective of an examiner, the assessment of teaching quality is a directional measure, with the evaluation of student compliance and the comprehensive grasp of teachers on both teaching and learning as the basis. Furthermore, the scientific design of examinations is also based on this.
Entering the university's undergraduate stage, specialization begins, with many specialty courses focusing on the basics.
Doubtfulness is not a suitable attitude when it comes to grasping the basic knowledge points of a certain subject, which is an important content of university exams.
In essence, the knowledge of a basic science is composed of scientific principles and basic facts, which are relatively fixed.
Just like what the teacher said 20 years ago, “The basic knowledge of mathematics I learned in university is still my focus now.”
Although knowledge points are basic and unchanged, it does not represent the examination topic and the test questions are repeated.
At many universities, exams are usually composed of a group of questions, and then the questions are collated and put into an exam paper by a subject specialist teacher. The exam paper is then marked by a group of experienced teachers from the same subject, which can help to reduce the problem of exam paper duplication.
However, the test should be designed to cover a variety of topics related to the actual teaching and learning situation, with difficulty levels distributed reasonably, and with a comprehensive understanding of the educational situation, covering all aspects of student learning, so that the test can be dynamic and targeted, highlighting basic knowledge and assessing capabilities simultaneously.
Examinations are the commanding rod of university education, with what kind of examinations students will have corresponding preparation plans, and this will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the advice letter to the students, the Lanzhou University has highly valued it and has already implemented the reform plan in the whole campus.
All teaching units should organize teachers to conduct seminars and end-of-course exams, formulate relevant examination items and related systems, strengthen the examination and supervision of examination items and evaluation procedures, and refine the grading system.
To solve the problem of single-type, repetitive questions in university entrance exams, a comprehensive system is needed, but the expertise is expensive and time-consuming. Teachers should have a full understanding of the learning environment and be able to interact with students in a positive way. This will help to create a better atmosphere for learning and make the exam more realistic, thus reducing the pressure of “studying for the sake of exam” and “studying for the sake of grades”.

The bride and groom had their wedding photos taken at the South Street Store. However, there is still no branch store.
Because we didn't have the time arranged in advance, we had to change the time twice and the photographer Linda was very patient with us and arranged the time for us.
I chose a good weekend to take pictures.
The staff of the gold couple's work are praised by all, regardless of whether they are consultants, beauticians or photographers.
This is my first time to do a proper makeover, wow! I'm so scared, but one day I'll look this good, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super gentle when it comes to makeup. They also do it very naturally.
We were lucky to have good weather when we went to take pictures at the riverside city. The makeup artist was always attentive to our clothes, headwear and accessories, and quickly noticed when they were slightly out of place and helped us to re-arrange them.
The photographer was also very quiet, taking pictures all day made him feel very happy.
When choosing photos for an album, due to seeing many examples online, I didn't want to delete too many photos, but when we were actually choosing photos, there was no thought of adding more photos. We just chose 24 photos and moved on. I was shocked when I heard that the package included one million photos and I was scared that I had chosen too many.
Today, the photos were finished and Lanlan gave them to me. I looked at them and felt they weren't good enough, so they helped me to re-edit them right away.
I compared the pictures I took before with the pictures of my sisters and I realized that our pictures were much better than before, simple, clear and fresh. That was the style I wanted.
Recommend everyone to go and take a look at the Shrine of the Golden Man in Xuanzhou!
Price of the package: 3999 yuan
Wish you all a happy and prosperous life. May the journey be as smooth as silk!

3200 newborns in Shaanxi province were found to have been given fake vaccination certificates.
(As reported by Xinhua on October 11th) The Registration Office of the People's Republic of Bangladesh said that due to the special feature of the fake paper for storage and transportation of goods, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since October, and the accumulated number of affected people has reached 3200.
Despite the fact that Caitlyn Amnesia Nurses had promised to provide fake documents for all the babies who had applied for a birth certificate, the records had already been recorded in the system. When the fake papers arrived the following week, they would be supplemented.
He appeared at the news release meeting and explained the issue of making fake newspapers for 10 months.
He said the problem appeared two months ago and sand-raising also faced the same issue.
One of the reasons was that Chinese factories producing counterfeit paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed shipments to our country.
He explained, Sabao used paper for counterfeiting and other regions were different, so it couldn't borrow other provinces' storage.
Quentin Amis revealed the latest batch of fake papers on June 6th, and the printing process was completed on June 8th and handed over to the printing company for partial printing work.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the 2021 National Economy Work Conference, thoroughly summarizing the current economic situation and making major deployments for 2022 economic work. He also pointed out the direction of progress and provided basic guidance for us to do a good job in economic work, leading up to the 20th National Congress of the CPC.
We celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party with pride, officially declaring the completion of the socialist new-democratic society, and striving to achieve the first centenary goal of the great struggle. We also embark on a new journey of modernizing the nation and conquering the second centenary goal.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, summarizing the Party's great achievements and historical experience over the past century, and finally approving the historic decision of the Party - the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Achievements and Experiences of the Party in the Century". This is a political declaration of the new era of the Chinese Communist Party, a commitment to persistently adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and an action plan for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In one year, the world has not seen such great changes in the epidemiological and clinical features of the novel coronavirus infection, the external environment has become more complicated and chaotic, and the task of prevention and control as well as economic and social development has become more arduous and heavy.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been adhering to the core principle of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, maintaining stability and pursuing progress in the midst of profound changes in both domestic and international situations. It has been persistently pushing forward the overall national strategy of preventing and controlling the novel coronavirus outbreak, adjusting the macroeconomic policies, and promoting economic and social development. All of this has resulted in remarkable accomplishments in the reform and opening-up drive, and in the implementation of the historic tasks of the Chinese Communist Party and the nation.
Achieving a good start, a key aspect of it was realized, constructing a new developmental framework and making progress in it, resulting in a new level of efficiency in development.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control has maintained the leading position in the world, with strong, robust and dynamic characteristics continuously displayed; the country's strategic technology strength has been accelerated, major breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of innovation, and the technology innovation capacity has been constantly improved; the industrial chain has been strengthened, exports have been enriched, and structural optimization has been continuously optimized, representing a new growth momentum; the reform and opening up has been deepened, and obstacles to the supply-side structural adjustment and the flow of resources have been broken, creating a new competitive advantage; social security has been strengthened, employment has been expanding, and income growth has been synchronized with economic growth, achieving "double first-class" results; environmental protection has been effectively implemented, and the employment rate has been steadily increasing, with the annual grain harvest continuously staying above 1.3 billion tons, achieving "double first-class" results. China's ecological civilization construction has been continuously promoted, carbon emissions have been reduced, and the low-carbon transformation has been steadily advanced
The achievements of these scores are the result of the core of the Party Central Committee led by General Secretary Xi Jinping, the result of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism and the scientific guidance of the Party Central Committee. The result of the united and concerted efforts of the entire party and the people of all ethnic groups, the hard work and perseverance of the whole nation.
Practice has proved again that the CPC is the core and the central pillar of the Party and the whole nation. It has established Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism as the guiding ideology of the Party and the nation, and has given a decisive meaning to the development of the Party and the nation. It has also made an important contribution to the great cause of the Chinese nation's glorious history.
With Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the Party has achieved great successes in uniting and leading the Party, the country and the people of all ethnic groups. With Comrade Xi Jinping's new century of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party has provided scientific guidance for the people of all ethnic groups to unite and strengthen their resolve, and we have overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles. On the path of comprehensively building a modern socialist country, we will create a brilliant new era and write an unprecedented glorious chapter in the history of the Party and the Chinese nation.
The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held next year, which is a major event in the Party and national politics and life.
Spreading the great spirit of the party, persevering in the steady and rigorous course of reform and opening up, comprehensively and meticulously implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress, hastening the construction of a new and modernized socialist country, and driving the momentum of innovation and development, we will continue to make progress in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We will persist in the overall and comprehensive approach of deepening reform, strengthening Party discipline, and improving the quality of development. We will remain firm in our commitment to the people's livelihood, social stability, and economic development, and we will resolutely resist all risks and challenges. We will continue to implement the "six steady" and "six secure" work, and strive to achieve a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We will also continue to pursue the goal of "two centenaries" and "one blue sky" by maintaining a healthy economic environment, a stable social environment, and a clean and beautiful political environment. We will certainly achieve the great victory of the 20th National Congress of the CPC.
Let us tightly unite around the core of Xi Jinping Thought and strengthen the four consciousnesses, four self-confidences, and two defenses. We should constantly enhance our political judgement, political expertise, and political execution, so as to turn the Party Central Committee’s decisions into real actions and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The two-day entrance examination for primary and secondary schools in Beijing will be unified organized by the Education Committees of each district.

To facilitate student participation in the exam, the East District extended the exam arrangement of last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school area, totaling 13 examination sites.
The examination will be divided into different examination areas according to the examination region and will be conducted in time segments. Students will enter the examination area according to the time segment.

The President of the Chinese Olympic Committee, Liu Peng, said that China has the ability to organize a successful Winter Olympics during a special period.
The Chinese president Xi Jinping expressed his enthusiasm for the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, and was confident that China has the ability to organize a successful Winter Olympics in a special period of time.

The 1984 Sanya Hot Spring Winter Games was successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Games will open the curtain and present a simple, safe and colorful grand event to the world.
We hope that the cooperation between the two countries in the fields of preparation for winter and summer sports competitions, training of athletes and other aspects will be deepened, and the Chinese Embassy in Botswana will continue to play the role of bridge and promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries. Let the two peoples walk together into the future, and wish the athletes of Botswana a good performance in the Beijing Winter Olympics.

The State Council has required strengthening the control of infectious diseases and epidemics in coastal cities, and demanded that the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Transport jointly formulate a mechanism for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. - Xinhua Net
The State Council issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus infection on the day before, requiring personnel who had recently left the mainland border cities (including Hong Kong and Macau) to undergo nucleic acid testing for proof of infection within 48 hours and to make sure to undergo at least one nucleic acid test when they arrive in the mainland border cities.
According to the notification, the time range for the requirements mentioned above is from March 15th, 2021 to March 14th, 2022, as determined by the respective provinces, cities and counties.
In addition, the city government has proposed to set up a quarantine and control area in the urban area.
This is an introduction of the person in charge of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and it is particularly relevant to some border cities. Cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of these cities, and the people frequent the border areas.
Implementing a differentiated management policy for infectious diseases, transforming the single barrier of defense into two barriers, is expected to achieve the relocation of the border, reduce the pressure of the infectious diseases, and minimize the social impact and social cost.
In recent years, there have been multiple cases of locally-transmittedinfectious diseases in our country, with most of them originating fromforeign countries via ports and coastal cities.
The notice mentioned above pointed out that some areas were not monitored for infectious diseases in a timely and effective manner, the management of high-risk personnel was inadequate, periodic testing of biological agents was not carried out, cold chains of medical products were not maintained, and the management of isolated facilities was not in accordance with regulations.
Notifications are required from the perfecting of the city's prevention and control system, strengthening the prevention and warning system, implementing border control measures, improving the weak links of the city, and maintaining a high level of prevention and control. Stay alert and be meticulous in your work, and make sure that the city's prevention and control work is tightly knit and scientifically well-prepared. Strictly enforce entry and exit inspections and strengthen the city's defense line.
Notice emphasizing that all cities along the coast should synchronize their work on epidemic control and population health protection, publish and regularly update the hotline for population health protection, regularly check the basic living supplies and prices, and actively respond to and reflect the public's emerging problems.
In accordance with the notice, the cities specified in it include open land roads, water roads, airports, counties (cities, districts, and provinces), cities (states, provinces, and regions) and cities under its jurisdiction, and the scope is determined and announced in time by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities).

The truth about the Chinese military for 20 years of spilling blood and guts - China News.
This video is from the Oil Ministry.
On December 11th, an oil platform named "The Killing Machine" caused a great deal of attention on the web.
This film describes how the United States waged the "anti-terror" war in Afghanistan to forcefully spread American democracy. Throughout 20 years of poverty, thirst for power, and indiscriminate killing, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were ruthlessly suppressed, committing all kinds of human rights violations.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, twisting the human nature, establishing a murderous gang.
For the past 20 years, the U.S. military has been killing countless Afghan civilians with impunity.
The Chinese military has established a "black prison" to punish "criminals" with brutal and degrading treatment.
The more people commit evil acts, the more hatred is aroused among the people of Afghanistan.
As video said, the U.S.-China conflict is becoming more and more intense.
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to Afghanistan, but only brought a lot of suffering and destruction.
Slapping the TV, let's uncover the truth of America's "anti-terror" hype, and expose its fake democracy's hypocritical facade!
You unintentionally stumbled upon the next article, discussing why this client wants to hire a warehouse storage company which is not within their business scope, but still within their service range. This article may help explain why the client wants to do so.
I visited many milk powder factories and got in contact with many milk powder production lines.
In reality, the materials of pouches and earrings are the same, without any difference.
Why is the warranty period of a bag with a detachable lining longer than two years, while the warranty period of a bag with a non-detachable lining is only one year?
Why is the price of the two so different?
In fact, many consumers, or even mothers' age group, believe that the quality is better than the same material.
In reality, the raw material is the same, but people think that what is expensive is good.
Even consumers with different mindsets can have different reactions to the same taste or flavor of food!
Now I'm going to tell you the reason why wearing expensive things is considered to be luxurious. Where is it considered to be luxurious?
Why are the prices of the same materials so different between them?
Because most factories consider the cost of packaging when setting prices, consumers find it hard to accept, which means that factories generate little to no profit, or even suffer losses. So what are factories supposed to do to survive?
Therefore, they were able to raise their prices on the hearing aid market, giving them a huge advantage in terms of profit margin.
Therefore, most of the factories are promoting the listening earphone rather than the pouch.
Advertising expenses for factories each year can range from a few million to even billions of yuan. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine and know.
As society develops, marketing costs are constantly increasing. For example, expenses related to promotional staff in shopping centers, fees for displaying products, and advertising costs are all on the rise.
Therefore, each factory is constantly introducing new products, and they are all designed to be fashionable. Moreover, their prices are constantly rising due to the increasing market costs. In other words, these are the new products that have emerged as a result of the increasing market costs.
Their ultimate goal is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There is still a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, without hesitation, accompanied by doctors from the hospital to help promote the product, from the earnings of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
Related laws in China are absolutely forbidden to operate in such a manner, in fact, this kind of behavior is to defraud consumers.

Whenever I visit a bookstore, I can't help but feel the thrill of success when I see the explosive books related to my studies.
Today's successful books and magazines are often based on the "best practices" principle — they first assume or hint that you can "do it" and then tell you what needs to be done.
Equal to saying a few words about the most important and fundamental circle.
Since they all have this common trait — — either they are pumped up with enthusiasm and work hard until the best result is achieved, or they are lazy and do nothing, or they are 100% or 0%, or you may climb the Mount Tai, or you may just wait around doing nothing.
This kind of "best practice" will make everyone admit "correct without comparison" but 99% of people will be fooled and run at the starting line.
Because this kind of thinking can be described as a "you must suffer to reach your goals, rebuild yourself, and make a 180 degree turnaround", it is a fatal weakness for many people.
People who resist change, such as those who follow the traditional rules of ink painting, those who persist in the old ways, and those who reject transformation, must be admonished. This is clearly an act of self-aggrandizement and taking advantage of others. It is also akin to banging a drum and goading on a cow.
Most people will hesitate before making any changes, either out of fear or due to the short-lived excitement of the moment. Some may be brave enough to take the first step, but eventually they will succumb to the hardships of the transformation and fall back into their old habits.
The renowned soundtrack of "From Tomorrow" starring Jackie Chan was universally acclaimed for its classic portrayal of humanity.
The greatest challenge of the "Best Practice" is that the door threshold is too high, which often exceeds the capacity of ordinary people's limit and makes most people "wondering and yearning".
Perhaps, “Doing it right the first time” is a path that can make success more accessible to more people.
The core of the principle of "Less is More" is to encou The 2018-2019 school year is off to a great start! We are excited to welcome new students and families to our school community and to welcome back our returning students and families. We are looking forward to a successful and rewarding year.We would like to take this opportunity to remind our families of our expectations for student behavior. We expect all students to be respectful and courteous to their peers, teachers, and staff. We also expect students to come to school prepared to learn, with all necessary materials and supplies. We also ask that students refrain from using cell phones and other electronic devices during the school day.We look forward to working together with our families to ensure that our students have a successful and rewarding school year. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
No matter what you do, if you do it with all your might, you will be much stronger than if you had not done anything.
Due to the decrease in the severity of the door knob, the possibility of ordinary people to persist indefatigably has increased, and thus the probability of success will also be enhanced.
Only by following the "successful principle" can success be achieved. The road is long and winding, but it has already been traversed.
Although it is advertised as the “best principle” and appears to be successful on the surface, it is ultimately able to inspire only a few; whereas the “second best principle” can effectively inspire more people, allowing them to benefit more.

The amount of resources stored in the Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 20.67% over the same period last year.
The State Administration of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Xinning County, Qinghai Province, announced on December 11th that the total amount of fish in the lake had increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, an increase of 40% compared to the initial protection in 2002.
The famous fish species "Squid" in the Qinghai Lake is a specialty of the lake, playing an important role in the ecosystem of the Qinghai Lake basin. It has significant effects on the water-fish-bird ecological security and biological diversity of the lake.
During the 60s and 70s of the 20th century, human activities such as large-scale fishing, overfishing, and uncontrolled breeding of aquatic animals had a severe impact on the environment of the Qinghai Lake, leading to a sharp decrease in the number of the lake's fish resources. In 2002, the total amount of fish resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Red List of Threatened Species listed the Hairy Crab in the Qinghai Lake as an endangered species.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has been implementing the ban on fishing in the lakes and rivers, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from going to Qinghai Lake and its surrounding rivers and tributaries to catch and sell raw fish or its products.
Meanwhile, we should also take measures such as increasing the flow of rivers and streams, clearing the Qinghai Lake, designing a scientific and rational fishway, and continuously enhancing the protection force to increase the resources of Qinghai Lake.
The introduction of the artificial breeding and release of the Qinghai Lake Trout (Schizothorax platypus) in Qinghai Province has been implemented for over 1.8 million fish since 1998, resulting in a contribution rate of over 23%.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and functional area for the prevention and control of the westward desertification.
In order to protect the Three Gorges, Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau ecosystems, the water and wildlife of the area, the government has been issuing warnings about the Long River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake Special Protection Areas since 2018. This has resulted in the construction of a comprehensive ban on fishing and hunting in the area.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I had to stuff into the bag. It was cold outside.
Do you mean that the goods are stored in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I thought it was stolen, but it was actually our people who took it away. Thanks.
It has been 1 hour already, and they still haven't sent it.
After seeing a long article about writing fake news, I was so tired.
Give unknowing men a dose of health advice.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will go through menopause around 50 years old.
After ensuring good health of the body, one can compare the monthly cycle more regularly.
But it is not the rule to predict the exact outcome within a week, roughly speaking. We need to prepare in advance and adjust the timing according to the situation. Sometimes the luck will be against us and we will be unlucky. (We need to adjust the timing in advance by several days.)
The severity of time, space, and pain is different for each person; some people need three days, some people need one week; some people have little blood, some people have a lot of blood loss; some people have no reaction, some people are in agony and need to be carried to the hospital and get medical help; the severity of the pain changes with time, and it does not represent the strength of a person.
Within 24 hours, the wound would not stop bleeding. The only thing that could be done was to apply a clean cloth or bandage to stop the bleeding and prevent it from reaching the clothes or furniture.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins, which begins right before your period and peaks during your period. Eating brunch can help relieve the cramps, but there's not much else you can do after the cramps have started.
Due to excessive release of blood and hormones before menstruation, it is easy to get a stomach ache.
If you reach the period, it's impossible to hide your belly, so you'd better come to the clinic as soon as possible.
The best time to change a sanitary napkin is every three to four hours. Otherwise, it is easy to get a yeast infection, and it is not advisable to sleep with a sanitary napkin for more than one night. If you are prepared in advance, you can have up to 50 pieces per month.
(This should be changed to, "Washable cloths are not necessary to be changed often, usually after five or six hours, and can be changed up to eight hours.")
During the full moon, the mood may become unstable and fluctuate due to hormonal changes. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, making it difficult to take care of yourself.

Autonomous vehicles are cars, trucks, and other vehicles that are capable of driving themselves with little or no human input. They use sensors, cameras, artificial intelligence, and other technologies to detect obstacles and make decisions about where to go and how to safely navigate their environment.Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, making it safer, more efficient, and more accessible. They could reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, reduce traffic congestion, and provide more efficient and reliable transportation services.The Impact on SocietyThe impact of autonomous vehicles on society could be far-reaching. Autonomous vehicles could provide more efficient and reliable transportation services, reducing traffic congestion and making it easier for people to get to their destinations. They could also reduce the number of accidents
The fluid is not only blood, but also contains endometrial tissue that has been shed.
After the conclusion of the monthly ritual, the inner membrane of the child's room became thin, and then slowly became thick. This can be understood as the child's room is a house, and each month is prepared to receive guests (the inner membrane becomes thick). If there is no guest, it will be demolished (the monthly ritual is performed) and a new house will be built in the next month.
The monthly cycle is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with each month lasting 24 hours of bleeding, and often accompanied by stomach aches and pains. Who would want to go through this?
However, people are able to be born due to their mother's hard work during the month of gestation, which is preparation for their first arrival in this world. We should all thank our mothers for their hard work and healthy pregnancy.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed by society, which told them it was immoral and shamed them. Everyone thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that preparing for pregnancy and childbirth is evil, they shouldn't say it out loud in public. Instead, the girls should stand up, they have never experienced it before and the boy will never go through it. They should not forget the kindness and justice, and they should understand the mother's attitude.
Finally, give it a try, sisters! Health care cloths are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and the gifts were not as good as expected.
We should also book a table for them to eat.
The store was very busy and chaotic. Everyone needed to check their products carefully before they left the store.
Is your electricity leaky?
Choosing the appropriate bathmat can have good health benefits, such as relieving stress and improving circulation. Today, our team will provide an answer to this issue, hoping to be of help to our friends.
As people's health awareness has been enhanced, the demand for bath tubs has been increasing rapidly. On the market, a variety of bath tubs ranging from a few dozen to thousands of dollars have been presented, providing consumers with a great selection space.
On related data tables, compared to traditional home appliances, the health care-related home appliances such as sauna bags have seen a rapid growth in sales, but sauna bags lack industry standards and thus have a certain safety risk.
In the water with electricity, it's really dangerous!
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his parents on their birthday, but when his parents tried to use it, they felt a burning sensation on their feet.
When Mr. Li first started using the vibrating function of the bath tub, he didn't expect it to cause such a stir. He was shocked when the vibrating function was suddenly turned off and he felt a strange sensation in his feet. His father said it was like a massage.
Mr. Li tried using an electric brush, but to his surprise, the brush lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to discover that the water in the bathtub was carrying electricity.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had to give up the massage chair and the hot tub. Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that this old, popular bath tub was still being used at high temperatures, applicable to all kinds of people and materials, there was no clear industry standards in terms of safety.
However, in general, a bathroom with a bathtub will not have any electrical problems, but it also does not exclude some products from the factory that do not have strict quality control.
Therefore, when purchasing a massage chair, choose a full-body shiatsu massage pillow.
Separating water and electricity can cause no safety hazards.

The 13th China Tea Expo opened in Wenzhou - Vision Point - Hunan Daily - Wenzhou Edition - China Voice Online
The 13th China Tea Industry Expo and the Introduction of New Techniques for Processing and Marketing of Red Tea was held in the International Exhibition Center of Hunan Province on December 10th, 2019. The event showcased the tea industry, introduced new tea technologies, and spread the tea culture, accelerating the target of the billion-dollar tea industry.
The Vice Chairman of the China National Supply-and-Demand Strategy Joint Committee, Mr. Huan Shunli, and the Vice Chairman of the People's Provincial Committee, Ms. Yao Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu from the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced the origin of the Red Tea at the opening ceremony, and infused a new dynamism into the “Five-Colored Xiang Tea”.
In recent years, the provincial and municipal governments have provided strong support for the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the tea industry in the region with an investment of billions of dollars, forming the "Three Tea Seas and Five Colors Tea" development context.
The tea industry in the province has seen great innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main forces driving the development of the tea category. The tea-growing region is pushing for tea tourism and integration, leading to an increase in tea production and revenue.
The wind and water keep flowing, and the red tea has gained new strength.
According to tea experts, once the green tea is harvested, the red tea and black tea can be produced. This will bring in an income for the tea farmers throughout the year, and the tea garden's value will continuously increase.
At the ceremony, the company was granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark and enjoyed the joy of rediscovering the "source of the Hunan Red Tea".
At the New Tea Expo in Fujian, a renowned tea merchant from China was seen tasting the "Ice Cream Tea" - a high mountain tea from the famous tea-growing region of Yunnan. He promptly placed an order for the tea.
The Chairman of the Tea Industry Association said, "Currently, the market for tea leaves is affected by various factors such as the epidemic and the weather, but from the Tea Expo, it is obvious that the tea industry is still flourishing and full of vitality."
A cup of freshly brewed red tea, injected with the essence of tea culture, brings a warm and vibrant atmosphere. The birth of the Xiang tea industry ushers in a new spring.

The problem of studying mathematics is not to be solved directly through intuition and feelings, but rather to be approached through logical reasoning and deduction.
The basic principles of philosophy are to explain the existence and basic nature of the world.
The phrase “Form and Matter” is translated from the book “The Yi Jing: A New Translation and Commentary” by Richard Wilkinson and William H. G. Lee. It is attributed to the Japanese scholar Zenjiro Shibata (Meiji period).
The branch of study includes the body of the theory, natural science and its extension problem.
This essay is about "What kind of words represent real existence entities and what kind of words are just representations of concepts".
Naturalism denies the existence of God.
According to the basic concepts of logical reasoning, all phenomena can be explained using natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
This research method is to study the word "God" without any fixation.
Spiritual philosophy is the study of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two-philosophy debate of yin-yang and one-philosophy debate of mind-body are the two major schools of thought discussing the relationship between spirit and flesh.
The study of knowledge is to explore the essence, origin, and scope of knowledge as a branch of philosophy.
Moral science is the systematic thinking and research of human ethics and morality in daily life; here, ethics is defined as a set of rules accepted by all people or a culture for all behaviors.
Moral philosophy can be divided into two major branches: abstract-theoretical moral philosophy, which involves the study of moral principles and ethical criticism, and applied moral philosophy, which involves the evaluation of different moral views and offers advice on right and wrong behavior.
Researchers should follow the ethical standards of behavior prescribed in the code of ethics. They should also apply moral philosophy, including biomedical ethics and political ethics, to their actual lives. Finally, they should describe the ethical standards they follow in their lives.
It is not the starting point of moral reasoning from a priori assumptions, but the observation of actual moral agents' conduct and its verification, which leads to the formation of all the moral factors of the decision, and the discussion of social groups' moral views.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
The first part of the lecture is about the moral philosophy of humanism, represented by Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger.
The second part of the lecture is about the moral philosophy of religious reform, with Confucianism as an example.
Part Three: Political Ethics, Represented by Mencius, Xu Youyu, and others; Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Experience Ethics, Represented by Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, and others; 18th century, German Idealism Ethics, Represented by Immanuel Kant and others; 19th century, French Utilitarian Ethics, Represented by Jeremy Bentham and others; 18-19th century, German University Ethics, Represented by Wilhelm von Humboldt and others; 18-19th century, British Inclusive Ethics, Represented by John Stuart Mill and others; 18-19th century, German Humanistic Ethics, Represented by Wilhelm Dilthey and others; 19th century, British Pragmatic Ethics, Represented by William James and others; 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, Represented by Hermann Cohen and others; 19th century, British Analytical Ethics, Represented by G.E. Moore and others; 19th century, German Existential
Logic is the study of "effective reasoning and proofing principles and standards".
Logic typically includes three parts: deduction, induction, and inference. It can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Chinese studies, or the study of the essence and significance of beauty, is the main topic of this discipline.
The money has been received, it is food donations.
The name of the animal is Gongbao, born in the Year of the Sheep, living on grassland, and thusly known as "Sheep Grandpa".
Due to the publication of the "Strange Password" series such as "Thai Strange News", "Indian Strange News", "Japanese Strange News", and "Korean Strange News", he has gained the nickname "Curious Master of One-Volume Strange Tales". He claims to be "Expertly Narrating Eight Paths of Bizarre Stories".
The Masked Saint, also known as China's Strange Tales, is a new horror film that takes you deep into the heart of Chinese folklore. Explore the mysteries of ancient legends, uncover the secrets of forgotten stories, and discover the beauty and danger of forbidden love.
The wanderer embarked on a mysterious journey again, this time in the South Moonlight Tower. Their lives were about to be revealed.
Curiosity drove him to become a millionaire by selling books.
The original Chinese version of "The Strange Passenger" after the "Different Domain Password" is a brand new work by the same author and the same protagonist, continuing the "Thai Strange Passenger" and "Indian Strange Passenger" unfinished stories!
You have to pay for everything, even for something as small as a chicken.
You should go to the restaurant and order something.
I would rather not go downstairs to buy things, so I end up spending so much money on things to be sold outside.
Ding Zi Liang: Zhi You Ren. (This is a phrase meaning "Sorry, I can't help you.")
Throughout the 30 years since the disaster, my family and I have been deeply grateful for the unconditional help from all of you. In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those who have been providing continuous assistance since 1994 when I issued a public appeal for help. Your help has never been interrupted.
Most elderly parents who encountered difficulties in life have already passed away, leaving their children alone in the world. The children have grown up and become successful in their careers.
You have been so kind to help us through the most difficult time of our lives.
The current novel coronavirus pandemic has spread to every corner of the globe, with the vast majority of donors having already exhausted their annual leave.
Therefore, I humbly request you to kindly stop giving us hard time——the Mothers of the Motherland in Tiananmen. This humanitarian rescue activity should be started as soon as possible.
I will forever engrave your love in my heart and your justice will be forever engraved in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my heartfelt blessing.
Allow me to use this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the International Federation for China Social Services (IFCSS) and the Micronesia Development Foundation (MCDF).
During the process of engaging in human rights assistance, the United States-China People's Fund and the Minnesotan China Partnership are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often having to cross paths.
Apple Daily published a photo of the Temple of Heaven Mother Goddess Web Site, with the responsibility of the Taoist priest to clean it.
Money can never be sent to the victims of the June 4th incident smoothly.
In 1994, Ding Guo Lao Tu suggested that a special team be established to receive and distribute donations for helping the victims of the Sichuan Earthquake.
In 1998, the MCDF established the 'Sixth Generation Fund for Chinese Orphans', which has been in operation for 11 years since then. In 2009, the MCDF then established the 'Sixth Generation Fund for Chinese Elderly in Distress', and has been continuously executing it until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from the donations made by the alumni and the public after the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, as well as from the generous contributions of individuals. The Democratic Progressive Party also provided support.
Since 2018, we have received the support of the National Natural Science Foundation for our research on labor reform.
After 31 years, the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the event.
During this period, "China People's Rights" also carried out its humanitarian rescue projects independently.
We all understand that Ding Teacher called for a stop to the June 4th donation, considering the donors' thoughts. We are all some retired people with limited income, so we express our gratitude to Ding Teacher here.
We will respect the decision of the hard-hit people and terminate this project within two years. We will also restore it as soon as possible when needed.
For those who have been enduring great pain and suffering for many years and have bravely risked their lives to deliver help to others, we express our deep gratitude and respect.

Member evaluation.

A programmer's experience sharing.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to seek training in a place, but if you don't have the idea of this aspect, it is better to self-study, since training costs a lot of money and takes 6 months of time.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a good choice, especially for those with self-motivation and weaknesses. Training is a great choice for them.
If you are strong enough to self-motivate and self-regulate, you can choose self-study, but it will be tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the teacher's qualifications of this institution. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions also do not have particularly strong teacher qualifications.
Before selecting this training institution, it is advisable to explore it in detail. Knowing the students of this institution can give a better idea of what it is like. After all, only the students of this institution can tell us what it is really like. Furthermore, the course offered by the institution can be assessed as good or bad.
Hi, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your personal situation. There is a big connection between learning this thing and personal situation.
For example, if you are interested in a specific profession, age, or language, you may want to study or pursue a career related to it, such as in a certain city.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many good online and offline training institutions, but the cost is high and the time investment is considerable, requiring a commitment of 3-6 months.
However, if it is my case, it is very convenient to self-study. There are many free learning resources on the internet, such as videos, articles, and forums. You can also find many training resources on b station. If you can't find resources, you can contact me and get free resources or detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can still afford to pay certain tuition fees and time investments, then it is recommended to attend training centers to learn. This way of learning is not very costly and the teacher explains in great detail, with the help of people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, there is help in planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training organizations will sign a job agreement, offering both a salary and referral bonuses for successful graduates. This will greatly simplify the job hunting process afterwards.
This is my opinion, which is based on my limited understanding of your situation. I have only briefly described it, so if you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I arrived at the store 1 minute before, and I saw it in the App.
What is it called?
You haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
Our company provides a variety of services including installation, cleaning, maintenance, wall hanging, clothes dryer, air conditioner, furnace, oil burner, lighting fixture, and glass polishing. We specialize in home and office services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me a pat on the shoulder. For the effort I have put in toiling hard in life, it is tiring but I must continue.
People will never give up on their effort and hard work. Those who appreciate it will be rewarded.
Life is like this, people only see the results, you have to go through the process yourself, facing life, we are strong and continue, there is no choice, the road can only look back but can not turn back……

Nevertheless, I will always believe that if I have a sincere attitude and persevere, I will be better than others, at least a bit! Let's try hard and never give up!
From the moment the sun rises until the morning, all the good things will begin. May you bring along happiness, luck, health and positive thoughts as you embark on a new day, and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good night.
In the past, happiness was a thing to be possessed, so people strived for it. As they grew older, they realized that happiness is a state of mind, and the more mature they became, the more happy they became.
Strive to be the most authentic and virtuous version of yourself, walk with courage and no regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life is composed of two treasures: a healthy body and a clear mind, shining brightly until old age!
Each stage of life brings its own unique challenges.
Many times, your inability to let go of things is not due to lack of power, but rather a positive attitude of facing up to it.
Since you can't escape, it's better to face it bravely.
The more afraid you are, the more difficult it is to overcome; if you face the difficulty boldly, the problem will eventually be defeated.
The First Shanghai International Art Biennale was held from November 2016 to January 2017. It was a grand event with the participation of artists from all over the world.
The First Dali International Art Biennale opened in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 12th, 2019. Sixty-four artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This exhibition is co-organized by the Shenzhen Duolun Museum of Contemporary Art and the China UCCA Center, with UCCA's Executive Director Liu Yujie as the curator.
This exhibition introdu 50,000-Year-Old Human Fossil Discovered in GreeceA 50,000-year-old human fossil has been discovered in Greece, according to a new study. The fossil, which is believed to be the oldest human fossil ever found in Europe, was unearthed in the northern part of the country. The discovery suggests that early humans were living in Greece much earlier than previously thought.The fossil, which was discovered in the Keros cave on the island of Keros in the Cyclades, is estimated to be 50,000 years old. The fossil, which is a partial skull, is believed to be the oldest human fossil ever found in Europe. The fossil was found in a layer of volcanic ash, which suggests that the human lived during the early Holocene period.The discovery suggests that early humans were living in Greece much earlier than previously thought. According to the researchers, the fossil is evidence of a much earlier presence of humans in the region than previously believed. The researchers also noted that the discovery could help to fill in the gaps in our understanding of the early
This exhibition occupies over 12,000 square meters of space, with six interconnected buildings exhibiting : 《Smoke and Mirrors》 《Inheriting the Experiment》 《Thinking of the Edge》 《Going Public》 《Beauty of a New World》 and 《Exploring the Spirit of Art》.
Among the 27 participating artists from Saudi Arabia, there are various forms of art such as painting, installation, and performance art. 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention, with some using innovative methods to create artworks from recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "The Story of the Mountains and Rivers" (2014), which reconstructed a classic mountain-and-river painting with discarded objects.
Di Liye expressed his wishes that the 2019 Expo could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain a better understanding of the cultural industry and creative community of the host country, and to strengthen mutual communication in the future.
Tian Wen Yu said: "The goal of the Two-Year Exhibition is to create a dialogue between two cultures, allowing the art of Saudi Arabia to be seen in a global context, as well as allowing the audience to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
During the exhibition period, we will also hold a series of lectures, inviting artists, curators and creative industry leaders to share their insights on cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Second, although the Rightists had a short-lived glory in history, it was due to the fact that they exposed themselves to the sunlight and drank the water, which made them sweat profusely; thus, they were easily defeated and crushed by the powerful forces of the State.
Although the real situation is still far from satisfactory, the right-wing has made positive contributions to the social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, we should define the true principles of socialism and set up standards for economic development, technological progress and political system reform and human rights protection. The positive meanings of the right-wing should not be denied.
Despite not completely agreeing with some of Li Weidong's views, I am very interested in them and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person. This is because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere in his views on Chinese society.
But I reject his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe revolution is inevitable, which will lead to social turmoil, people's suffering, and political instability. In other words, it is futile to expect a foreign power to intervene.
Four, changing or improving China requires perseverance and taking responsibility as a citizen, political plots are doomed to fail, it is a mixture of heterogeneous elements.
Let's talk some more.
Left, in reality, is a relic of the era and politics.
If the right has positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to right-leaning opinions and analyze their ideas at times of need. Then the left will have been rendered useless, because the left's only goal is to overthrow the Communist Party's rotten carcass!
I recently saw some of my friends looking downcast and feeling unwell. They were also feeling angry and frustrated, so I thought it was not necessary to say anything.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all a waste of time. They're all just a bunch of stubborn, irrational people.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't want to admit that we are wrong. Why do we need to do that?
I tell my friends this way: When people insult you for five inches, and when they make fun of your left leg, it proves our middle path is correct!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but later in life they forget their dreams or pursue them half-heartedly.
As one dreams, one walks slowly, slowly, and eventually slays a dragon.
I think Left-Right is a generalization of constraints and freedom, and China's historical and cultural genes have caused it to be biased Left.
The right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing focuses on control and equality. Both prioritize fairness and safety.

Although I couldn't understand it, I still gave it a thumbs up.
What else is there to say? Flowers are already so beautiful.
For the past two years, the US has been imposing sanctions on Huawei's components, not only putting the company into an unprecedented predicament, but also causing "US-based" companies to suffer immense losses.
The US imperialism has been pressuring China's semiconductor industry, requiring domestic enterprises and alliance members to simultaneously lock down the Chinese semiconductor industry, resulting in a direct impact on the global chip supply chain and chip manufacturing enterprises. This has caused a decrease in research and development investment, a decrease in production capacity, and a shortage of global chip supply chains.
Now "chip shortage" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price hikes, almost all industries using chips have been severely affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-authority, more and more countries' technology giants began to walk the "China-ization" road.
In order to tightly control the global semiconductor industry, the US is pulling the strings of the Chinese semiconductor industry's development, recently inviting the US to host the "Chip Summit" and offering subsidies to maintain its domestic semiconductor giants, such as Intel, for example.
Most people will take it for granted that the effects of the earthquake will cause a certain amount of damage to the power grid, and it is quite possible that it will lead to the "theft" of electricity from the power grid.
This is because Intel, the giant in the semiconductor industry, has been investing in the Chinese market for decades and has accumulated a large number of talents and technological reserves. It is inevitable that Intel will quickly rise and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor in a short period of time.
However, regarding Intel's decision, Taiwan's chip pioneer Zhang Zong-mian showed no regret.
At the "2021 Teacher's Wisdom Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Changming's speech caused a stir, openly criticizing Intel for its outsourcing of chip manufacturing, which he described as "shameless".
Zhang Chunguang's determination to invade the lucrative circle of the gaming industry was fueled by his long-standing grudge against 30 years of accumulated resentment and animosity towards Intel.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always at the forefront of the US semiconductor industry, occupying the pinnacle of global success. It was the undisputed champion of the world's emerging microprocessor market.
Throughout the 80s, the world's semi-conductor high-end chips were dominated by a few powerful players.
During the semiconductor industry's IDM era, chip design, manufacturing and packaging were all completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a pattern makes some small enterprises unable to bear the burden and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only wish but not afford the cost of constructing a large-scale production line.
After feeling the market demand, the chip industry began to appear in the 80s, and the cooperation of subcontracting began to emerge. In 1984, Zhang Chung-Ming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in the production of chips.
After a short while, Zhang Chang's dream became a reality. Taishan Electricity started to operate.
The company has been focusing on the production of jewelry processing for a long time and has not designed any products. It only provides outsourcing services for jewelry manufacturing.
When Tsinghua University was just established, it was a small and weak university in front of the giant and powerful Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chuangmiao had once sought investment from Intel, but Intel was reluctant to invest in Taiwan's manufacturing ecosystem, which was too self-centered, and rejected Taiwan's manufacturing industry.
Zhang Chunguang also recognized that at that time, Intel's foundry services were not available.
I never thought that when I watched the documentary about the giant in the jewelry industry, I would have to start doing jewelry repairs as well.
Therefore, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when Intel entered the Jade Circle.
Now the value of Taiwan's chip industry has exceeded Intel.
Facing the fierce competition in the Taiwan market, Intel is also unwilling to be passive and complacent.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor has already reached 3nm chip-making, while Intel is still lingering at 14nm from 7 years ago.
Wanting to escape the reality is not easy.
He didn't wait.
I placed the order at 7:06 PM and it took 2 hours.
Today let's take a look at some [weird] hot searches.
What is normal emotional behavior?
After the three hot topics of the month of February: the Dragon Boat Festival, the Goods Price Increase, and the Crazy Rich Asians Event, the emotional wave spread and formed a peak, then followed by a smooth decline (a curved line). If the second wave of emotion is generated, it will have a small hump again.
It looks like the emotional model displayed on the official website of the network has nothing in common with the one displayed on the website.
What is the emotion of abnormality?
Six hot spots were randomly chosen from the same event, presenting a [[mountain peak shape]], [[tooth shape]], and [[cliff shape]].
[Peak-and-Trough Status] People quickly responded to the heat, ensuring that the topic stayed hot; [Cyclical-Heat Status] Periodic heat ensured that the topic stayed hot; [Cliff-Edge Status] People quickly abandoned the topic, leaving it with no purpose; [Functional-Heat Status] People responded to the heat, pushing the topic forward to a new mission and battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave is exactly the same as the valley of the other event, only a few seconds apart. It is inevitable that the united forces of the water army will be deployed to the new mission, and the offensive will be launched.
Professionalization of the Dark Gate is evident: Several dozen hotspots have emerged simultaneously on the rankings, attracting attention from various quarters - some for their innovative strategies, some for their responsibility, some for their competitive spirit, some for their attempts to shift the paradigm, some for their impact on cognition, some for their misleading judgement, some for their stimulation of emotions, and some for their meticulous planning and execution of tactics. Dark producers have also been meticulously segmenting their accounts and nodes, thus making it difficult to spread the sentiment.
Transmission is a science, opening up a new perspective, allowing for a variety of emotions, and even without access to the data, it will still be shaped by the black box.
Whatever path we take, we will leave behind a trace of our journey. Together, we can unearth these traces.
The source of the data is the Hot Seat Time Machine.
A case of plague was discovered in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China for the first time.
On December 12th, the Central News Agency of China reported that the first case of novel coronavirus infection was discovered in Beijing. The virus was found in a patient from Mongolia, who had recently traveled to the city.
On the 10th day of May, the first case of plague was reported in the country. Two cases of opium addiction and one case of malaria were also reported.
According to the South African Department of Health, a traveler from South Africa arrived in Mokopane, Limpopo Province on November 27th and was later diagnosed with HIV. Another traveler from Mokopane, who had recently returned from South Africa, was tested for HIV on November 30th and was found to be positive.
After being treated in a hospital, both patients' test results became negative and they have returned to their respective homes.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced on January 10th that three cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been confirmed.
These 3 people are students. This month, they all returned from overseas travel. Due to the weakness, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent and control the spread of the virus, the government has been constantly increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers aged 12 and above who arrived by plane must pay for and go through a mandatory X-ray inspection at the airport.
The Sichuan Provincial People's Government announced on October 10th that it would begin to vaccinate 5-11 year old children with the new coronavirus vaccine.
The mayor of Kunming, China, Kemin Zou, announced on November 9th that the city had discovered three cases of plague, a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease.
The Ministry of Health conducted genetic testing of 12 new coronavirus samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd. Three of the samples were found to be infected with the virus.

Because of trust, I first introduced my friend. Therefore, I chose to take a look at the basic budget of 700,000 yuan for the initial stage of my house.
As soon as they entered the store, they began to pull off a series of scams.
I was the first time to the store just showed them my floor plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they still gave me a price of $7 million, which is quite reasonable. They didn't even know what brand of material they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will drag you away and force you to hand over your money. (This money is gone forever unless you have enough experience and knowledge to fight them off.)
When negotiating for a car loan, they will invite their manager to tell you. If you can pay off the loan today, you will get a great discount.
This is an example of being scammed out of a lot of money. I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late.
He gave me an estimate of 7 million without including the cost of water and electricity, as well as any doors or closets. The bathroom was not included in the estimate.
Their service fees are much higher than other companies' fees.
I lost trust in this company and didn't know what to expect at the beginning. So I just signed the contract without making things clear.
When I went to ask them to return the money, they displayed a very experienced mannerism, with a specialized team to face you.
Regardless of how it happened, the customer's problem was ultimately their own fault. They had no right to blame anyone else.
Different types of responsibilities, as well as many details, do not want to speak one by one, it is all tears, do not choose them, because I found friends to repair the house is not good quality, later calculate various expenses.
The original dragon costumes were used to deceive people in ancient times. Now they have been changed to resemble American beauty and have become inactive.
Therefore, everyone should choose a reliable company to do the decoration of the house.
After everyone has chosen, we will all look into these things and get answers to our questions about the cost of renovation, which is not little money.

The sky is full of stars, the constellation of the twins, and a stream of star rain will arrive on the 14th day of the Chinese lunar calendar. It will be a very grandiose day.
On December 12th, the Chinese Astronomical Society of Tianjin held a press conference to introduce the last grandiose meteor shower of the year, the Double Zodiac constellation meteor shower, which will be arriving on the 14th of December in a grandiose manner. Meteor shower lovers can observe it after dark.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing photographed a double-star rainbow in Qinghai on December 13th, 2018.
Most of the periodic comets that produce meteor showers are members of the Solar System's Oort cloud, but the mother of the Geminid meteor shower is a 3200-numbered Kuiper belt object, a rare type of trans-Neptunian object.
The second-known meteor shower is the Zodiac Rain, which is also known as the Zodiac Rainfall. It is not the result of a comet or asteroid, but is instead believed to be the result of a planetary collision.
Dr. Peng Xin from the Tianjin Astronomical Observatory gave a lecture on the “Double Zeta” meteor shower, which usually appears in the last days of the year and can be seen from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is renowned for its large flow rate and stable performance. It is often compared to the Chinese constellation of the same name, and is one of the three great meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
The most prominent feature of the Twin Star Cluster is its slow star speed, vivid colors, and abundance of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tens of thousands of astronomy lovers gathered in Tianjin on December 13th, 2020 to witness the shooting of a double rainbow satellite.
The meteor shower of the year 2019 will arrive on December 14th or 15th at around 15:00 UT. According to the prediction, the ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors per hour seen at the zenith) will be 150.
Recommend a star chart for the constellation of the Twins.
Last year, the double-star constellation of Ursa Minor gave people a deep impression, but this year's double-star constellation of Ursa Minor will be affected by the Moon's light interference, and the level of magnificence will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th day of the lunar month, the moon is in its full phase, shining brightly in the night sky. This may cause some interference for those trying to observe the moon, but it will become easier to observe later in the night when the moon is at its brightest. This is also the time when the Double Star and the Zodiac constellations are most visible, as the radiation point of the stars will be higher than usual.
Enjoying the star shower and watching the rain after the full moon is a great experience. However, you should be aware of the cold and take measures to stay warm.
How can we observe more stars efficiently?
It is not advisable to conduct observations in urban areas, but one can choose to observe from a mountain, a valley, or a rural area facing east, and wait patiently until the moon falls before conducting the observation.
The flow of rainfall from the Gemini Constellation is very large in all directions. When observing, one does not need to constantly keep the Gemini Constellation's radiation point in sight.
Friends who love taking pictures should consider taking pictures of beautiful stars and rain drops with a wide angle lens and a high ISO setting.

What differences exist between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional television that the host mentioned should be referring to liquid crystal television, while the difference between plasma and liquid crystal televisions in the market positioning mainly consists of two points: 1) Plasma televisions are generally more expensive than liquid crystal televisions; 2) Plasma televisions have better picture quality but shorter lifespan than liquid crystal televisions.
The first one is laser TV, focusing on the large-screen market.
Compared to the liquid crystal television market, the laser television market is more focused, with more attention being paid to the large-screen market. In other words, laser television is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream liquid crystal TV size is between 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally above 75 inches, with the maximum size exceeding 100 inches, which fully satisfies the user's demand for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the global demand and sales of laser TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for over 60% of the total 80-inch and above TV market.
According to the prediction of the Chinese market, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 20
The reason why we have achieved such good results at the Great Wall Shopping Mall is mainly due to the excellent performance of our laser vision correction in the protection of eyes.
Based on the principle of laser television, the light from the laser source is not directly reflected into the eye, compared to the liquid crystal television's backlight source, the imaging process is closer to the natural conditions of the object, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Shanghai Institute of Standardization and Quality Control, in collaboration with the Beijing Ophthalmology Hospital, conducted a rigorous comparison experiment of viewing both laser and liquid crystal televisions under the same conditions. 144 data sets were collected.
Data verification: Laser TVs possess very strong eye protection features, even in certain aspects exhibiting certain improvement effects.
As the importance of eye health has been increasingly recognized, laser eye surgery has been drawing more and more users, taking advantage of its unique benefits. In this context, the popularity of laser eye surgery has been growing exponentially.
The second generation of laser TVs will focus on the high-end market.
Exploring the prices of liquid crystal televisions is an ongoing process, with prices currently ranging from thousands of yuan to above. As the size and light source of the televisions improve, the prices have been gradually rising.
What is the price of this expensive laser TV?
Ken is rational.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
By taking advantage of the short-focus lens and the laser projection technology, the laser television can achieve a 100-inch experience within a short distance, with a small space requirement and a miniature host.
On the brightness aspect, a leading brand LED TV can reach above 2000 nits.
Adding the heating element reduces the power consumption, which in turn reduces the wear and tear on the equipment, and extends the lifespan of the TV.
Besides this, there are many high-end laser TV models that also come with 4K Ultra High Definition picture quality, Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, and Immersive Sound technology, providing users with an even more immersive visual and audio experience.
Talking about the fake demand, instead of general demand, is the product of fine division. Discussing the quality and investment of the product will bring a better output-input ratio. Thinking about the big screen and watching environment will be beneficial. Weighing the advantages and disadvantages afterward is optional.
A simple explanation, the wide angle lens is close to the screen, it is inevitable to use the expensive wide angle lens and reflection mirror, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block part of the environment light, using the fabric of Fengshui, the price is expensive, the size of 80 cm can be exchanged for 65 cm of liquid crystal.
There is still one point I want to emphasize. I particularly detest the practice of some merchants who put up mirrors in their shops to reflect lights to the eyes of customers. This is not only a nuisance, but also a health hazard. The lights reflected from the mirrors can be harmful to the eyes, and it is even worse for the eyes when looking at the light from a liquid crystal television. When the television is turned on, the light is also reflected onto the ceiling. Is this not a nuisance?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will never be completed.
The hot spot effect of the curtain was ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from one corner. That was really difficult to bear.
The store chooses the best quality products and offers a wide range of photography services. It is currently looking for a suitable store location.
After adding a date to my WeChat appointment, my girlfriend quickly arranged the available time and replied the message promptly.
Before entering the store, I had a look at the photographs taken inside. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The shooting style involved various angles and perspectives.
After having conversed with my little sister in a simple manner, I was very patient and persistent in helping her try on two different outfits, until we finally settled on the perfect look. The photographer then set up the scene, giving directions and carefully guiding each movement. He also paid attention to the details, striving for perfection.
However, due to the lack of specific shooting ideas, the photos I took were not what I wanted. Nevertheless, they should be visually appealing.
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, and there will be a good communication afterwards. It will be a stylish and meticulous selection of photos.
The makeover took about a month, and it was worth the wait~
The King of Shootings, the Second Chinese Photography Festival, was held, allowing participants to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed in.
In the end, he chose a black blazer, experiencing a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer is a younger brother of 95, and he feels slightly more experienced but still a bit green. He hopes to give more advice in the future after more shooting experiences. The shooting process was quite enjoyable.
This store specializes in the selection of high-quality photography and cinematography equipment. It is the best choice for photographers and cinematographers.
I've already visited the homepage, so I'm here to check out Queenie~
First, I filled in my name and phone number. Then I chose clothes, veil and makeup. The service was patient and the atmosphere was good. After that, I posed for a while and the photographer taught me how to pose. The result was amazing, it looked like I had double eyebrows! After a month, I received the photos. It was almost the same as the original one.
The environment is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
The makeup spot is not far away, there is a photography backdrop inside.
[Service] Very hot and very attentive.
The instructor was very patient.
The photographer will also be very attentive in teaching you the movements.
The photographer will also offer to retouch the photos if you are not satisfied.
Experience has shown that the eyes may become slightly protruding, the original double eyelid has been replaced by a triple eyelid.
Even my eyebrows were shaved off, which made me feel a bit awkward for daily life without eyebrows.
The picture was taken after 10 minutes, but the result of the P-picture was not satisfactory. It felt like there were too many layers of eye makeup on.
Because it was not very clear what style to choose, she tried two different outfits. In the end, she chose the black formal dress.
After choosing the clothes, the makeover process began. The stylist and the makeup artist were super patient and worked hard to get the desired result. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
After getting dressed and doing makeup, I started to take pictures. The photographer had full control of my poses and expressions throughout the process, which was very smooth and relaxed.
After finishing the photoshoot, he chose four favorite pictures and showed them to his brother. The ending was very happy and fulfilling.
I have not received any replies for 3 days due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, thus I cannot join #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee!
The strangest thing was that I always used the same credit card for payment.
I always have to pay for shipping fees every time.
Can I pay my rent in installments? After you finish your investigation, can I get my monthly fee back?
Should one buy insurance when buying a small umbrella?
Xiaomeng is a platform for insurance and financial services in the Internet.
According to the conditions set forth in the Insurance Regulatory Authority's Guidance on Establishing Insurance Intermediary Companies (2015 Revision): To become an insurance intermediary company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, founding person, and no serious violations of law in the past three years; the minimum capital requirement is 5000 yuan; and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Authority.
This three-tiered system is actually quite complicated. It requires strength and perseverance to go through the process. Insurance companies need to have a good investment attitude and be approved by the relevant government departments. Shareholders must also take a prudent attitude. In short, it is not an easy task for any insurance company to achieve.
At this point, it's still not bad, it's worth believing in.
From insurance products, we can see that Small Umbrella Insurance is a kind of insurance marketplace, where many companies' famous stars are selling their risky insurance products, such as the newly released and super-expensive 5th Superstar Edition and Thai Superstar Edition, both of which are covered by Thai people. Small Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its neutrality.
From the perspective of cost: Internet platforms, due to the absence of operating costs such as rent and labor costs, have higher prices than traditional products, and the cost of subscription is flexible, reducing the burden of monthly payments, and minimizing the risk of insurance companies. At the same time, it can maximize the potential of insurance products.
This point is still very good.
You can consider it.
From the perspective of insurance professionals, this point is particularly important, as the insurance industry requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health and professional areas. Insurance professionals often add their own subjective views when self-insuring, which can easily lead to misrepresentation and even fraud.
I have done insurance sales over the phone for "Tencent Weibo" (just like Little Umbrella, it is an online insurance platform). I take full responsibility for this.
Insurance for the Internet is real, but it's also risky. Unprofessional Internet channels lack experienced personnel, which can lead to misleading sales.
For example, if you buy insurance for 600 million yuan, you can get a free mobile phone and receive 6 million yuan of accident insurance. These marketing strategies have been successful, but they are not sustainable. The first month is free, but the second month requires payment according to the normal fee. Many customers are confused and do not know why they have to pay for the insurance they bought.
I can buy 1 block of gold with 100,000 RMB, and the insurance company will pay 600 million RMB (the whole world is shocked).
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666, 8888, etc. These numbers are only sent out when there is a prize draw and you don't exchange it for anything. Furthermore, no one will remind you if there is a prize draw.
For those who are saving for retirement, it's like digging a hole. Even if you have 6 million dollars worth of insurance, it's only a short-term solution. If you don't have any other business risks, the 6 million dollars can't solve the problem and your life will be a mess afterwards.
At present, the country is also vigorously combating the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, we should look at the platform, product and business from all angles, and the problem lies in the professionalism and work ethics of the staff.
Recommendations for choosing an insurance agent should be considered carefully, as there are many insurance companies offering a wide range of products and opportunities for customers to choose from, as well as competitive prices for some products.
I have helped 59 online customers by providing support, guaranteeing product quality, and saving up to 2000-3000 RMB per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an experienced insurance broker with over 3 years of business management training and customer service experience. I have worked with over 100 insurance companies and served more than 1000 businesses. Before proposing a policy, I will carefully assess customer needs and tailor a suitable insurance product. During the policy period, I will strive to secure the best coverage for the customer and make sure all the paperwork is in order. After the policy is in place, I will handle all the paperwork and make sure the customer is worry-free.
Grow together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, online insurance is when a person clicks on the insurance link and can complete the entire insurance process autonomously.
During this process, neither the insured nor the insurance agent needs to sign any documents, and all steps can be completed by the insured himself.
Although there is not much "ceremony feeling" in online insurance, even the paper contracts of printing out the insurance policy may not exist, it will not affect the validity and legality of the electronic contracts.
This kind of pattern is similar to a typical telephone sales job, but when it comes to buying insurance, it could be a potentially fatal problem, as the subsequent service may not meet expectations.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that spans over several decades. When purchasing insurance, should we carefully consider and reflect upon it? Our chosen “intermediary” (i.e. insurance agent) should be one that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even after many years.
How can I contact the delivery staff?
I have already finished the task in 3 minutes.
Is it supposed to give me compensation?
I said I wanted to open the door and send the goods.
But that guy just gave it to the gatekeeper, and then people just left.
The gift was wrong.
Your hands have already taken my one piece of overseas sale, but still waiting for it.
My order has been received at 19:25, but they are still reluctant to ship out.
Did you buy everything? Do you need to go to other stores to buy something else?
How do I do it?
Your horse has gone to where?
Do you still need to wait?
I am sending a bill.
Good, you didn't cancel, so I called the police.
However, my food may cause safety and health problems.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of discrimination and ridicule, and cannot accept any form of physical or verbal attack.
In the civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't see the political parties and factions, you must suppress it first, which is an uncivilized behavior.
From you I started to send friend requests, then I posted a flirty thread on your wall, and finally I tried to publish your home address and father's name on social media. I have already taken an unresponsive attitude.
After you tagged me, you continued to talk about me behind my back in a malicious and insidious manner. You discussed my private matters, such as my shyness, embarrassment, and physical appearance. You even talked about my sleeping and eating habits. All of this made me feel so uncomfortable and humiliated.
After I sent you the picture, I received many messages from your friends, including some related to your face, some about your behavior, and some about your embarrassing moments.
I'm sorry, as a female student, I couldn't continue to remain silent anymore.
After you upload the news about me reporting a crime, you have not been trapped at all, instead you have become more and more aroused.
Regardless of your political background or identity, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
You can continue this type of provocative, humiliating, shaming, and berating discourse, you can also continue to say that you are only loving and caring for me, you can also continue to think that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is your picture or continue to post all sorts of attacking language.
You can't stop them. I can't either. We have no power to resist you.
Even if I don't recognize you, I don't want to recognize you. My appearance and physique do not need your evaluation and comments.
I was so ashamed that I felt like no one would want to be friends with me if I didn't do something to make up for my mistakes.
My friend asked me, is it still good?
I said hello, you wouldn't believe it.
I feel like even if no one else is treated so badly, I can still say I'm doing okay.
Regardless of work, society, politics, or business, only those people who lack basic human decency will choose to hurt any woman in such a manner.
I believe, integrity is inherent in human nature.
I have cut some of the comments and gave them to everyone for review.
You should not let anyone bully you.
You are the enemy of civilization.
Laugh out loud.
The People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum.
During the Third China National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss topics such as digital technology industry and national digitalization transformation, digital technology industry and the novel coronavirus outbreak, and the economic recovery and development after the outbreak.
The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Mr. Nguyen Mung, expressed that although the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the number of Vietnamese digital technology companies to decrease, their revenue and growth potential remain promising, with an estimated growth rate of around 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has been actively developing digital products and concentrating on solving the major issues facing the country, resulting in an increase in the number of digital products exported and Vietnam's ranking in the digital technology sector.
Yuan Meng Xiong was elected as the Chairman of the Digital Technology Industry Association and called on the government to provide support for the development of digital transformation platforms. Taking on the task of developing these countries' digital platforms is the responsibility of the state.
On the forum, various departments and government agencies are leading the way in studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology. Companies, organizations, and individuals have been sharing their experiences and resources to promote the development of the digital economy in Vietnam, and have been actively pushing for the digital transformation of the country.
The Premier, Li Keqiang, emphasized during his speech at the World Economic Forum that digital transformation is the world’s inevitable trajectory, and a practical demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem, digital transformation services must involve the whole population, thus requiring everyone's participation.
People and enterprises are the core, body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be aimed at benefiting the people and enterprises.
The Premier, Li Keqiang, emphasized the importance of digital transformation, which must manifest the spirit of the nation, relying on internal forces, strategies, and long-term decision-making factors, while external forces should be treated as critical and breakthrough points.
He believed that digital transformation should be driven towards in-depth development and sustainable development, such as participating in the fight against the novel coronavirus, economic recovery and development, responding to the changes after the epidemic, overcoming the natural resource depletion phenomenon, and promoting green transformation and green energy development.
To participate in the protection and promotion of national culture, traditional values, and the national spirit, it is necessary to build a database related to banking, taxation, land management, and logistics digital transformation.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and powerful.
The Premier requested that all levels of government, all levels of bureaus and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, to further enhance their understanding of digital transformation, to continue to formulate and perfect the system regarding digital transformation, to strengthen the national management level and to adhere to the spirit of respect, communication, responsiveness, enthusiasm and proactivity in driving the development of digital technology enterprises.
During the period of the forum, Premier Fan Ming attended the 2021 "Vietnam Manufacturing" Excellent Digital Product Award Ceremony and the "Vietnam Manufacturing" Digital Product Exhibition Opening Ceremony.

Here are 5 reasons why you should consider automating your warehouse.1. Reduce CostsAutomating your warehouse can help reduce costs in a variety of ways. Automated systems can reduce labor costs by eliminating the need for manual labor and reducing the amount of time needed to complete tasks.

The Changjiang River is the longest river in China and the third longest river in the world. It flows through the provinces of Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and is a major source of drinking water, irrigation, and electricity for the people of China. The Changjiang River has been designated as a national key waterway, and is an important part of the country's ecological system. The Changjiang River has been working to achieve a green and integrated service area, covering the entire river basin.
On December 11th, 2019, the reporter Wang Xian from Chengdu visited the newly-built Wuhan Green-service Area on the Yangtze River. This is the second green-service area after the successful operation of the Fourth Green-service Area in Chengdu. It is the official start of the green-service area operation along the Yangtze River.
This area has covered the entire length of the Yangtze River, from upstream to downstream.
The Vice Chairman of the Communications and Transportation Department, Mr. Zhu Jianhua, introduced the management of the 10 green service areas on the Yangtze River and the lower reaches. These areas have been recognized by the sailors and have played an important role in promoting the quality and safety of the navigation on the Yangtze River.
The event of covering the entire area of the Changjiang Green Transportation and Logistics Service Zone with greenery is another milestone of the Changjiang Green Shipping and Navigation Project. It has greatly improved the ship pollution control and navigation service capabilities.
According to the introduction, the Green Service Area on the Water is an important facility providing comprehensive production and life services for the vast ship and its crew, helping to solve the urgent difficulties of the ship crew.
This project is to build a green and integrated service area for living, production and government along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It will provide services such as boat maintenance and emergency rescue, as well as eco-friendly services such as boat repair and life services. This will make boat travel more efficient and convenient, and improve the living and working environment of boat personnel.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China and can be seen in the latest satellite images. The most powerful weapon in the US arsenal is visible and can be accessed from the disputed island of Diaoyu. This is a significant signal to the region's US allies and adversaries.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, on January 9th, the United States Navy's "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier was found in the Balabac Strait.
The Sunda Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Java Sea, is a strategic location in the Western Pacific.
This platform has predicted that the "Carl·Wen·Sen" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the Carl-Gustafson aircraft carrier, the first time to load F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey transport aircraft for deployment.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" and the "USS Abraham Lincoln" are currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean. Besides the "Carl Vinson" carrier, the "USS Abraham Lincoln" was also deployed from the United States on January 3rd.
The F-35C carrier-based aircraft of the US Navy's 314th Fighter Squadron has made its first sortie, attacking the enemy team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy has one other carrier stationed in the Asia-Pacific region: the “Ronald Reagan” (USS Ronald Reagan) in Yokosuka, Japan.
The mothership battle group still includes the "Shanghai Lake" and "Strike Destroyer" class vessels, as well as the "Avenger" class vessels designed for long-range ocean patrols.
The United States has deployed three aircraft carriers to the South China Sea to challenge China's dominance in the region, according to a new satellite image published by the "South China Sea Strategy Intelligence Platform" on January 17, 2022.
(@SouthChinaSea Strategic Situation Awareness) The US Navy has deployed its most powerful weapon to the South China Sea for a rare visit. The CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft flew along the route on 17th January 2022.
According to the US cable television news network (CNN) on January 17th, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy weapons store was mysteriously missing from Guam during the weekend.
The nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-733) entered the waters near Guam on Saturday, January 15th. The submarine is part of the United States Navy's Ohio-class submarine fleet and is armed with 20 Trident missiles. It also has several dozen nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and torpedoes.
The US-China maritime dispute has been heating up, with the US recently sending a warship near the disputed islands in the South China Sea. Analysts say this is a signal of the tense situation between allies and foes in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. submarine has visited Guan Island since 2016, and it is the second time Guan Island has been open to the public since the 1980s.
The Chinese navy has been rapidly expanding its presence in the South China Sea, with a number of military installations being built on disputed islands in recent years.
The island is a popular tourist destination in China.
The United States Navy declared in its statement that the Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Yantar" had visited the Paracel Islands, which strengthened the cooperation between the United States and the region, displayed its capabilities, flexibility and readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the region.
The typical submarine used for boomer operations is called a "Boomer submarine".
The 14-ship U.S. Navy submarine force typically operates in a highly secretive manner.
The secret of the submarine-launched ballistic missile "Poseidon" has been revealed, making it the most important survival weapon in the world. This system also includes a domestic launch facility for ICBMs in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
Recently, the stock prices of many tech companies have been falling, including Meta, which has seen a 26% drop. This has resulted in a loss of 2510 billion US dollars in market value. What is the reason for this unexpected competition?
Meta (originally Facebook) is an advertising company, mainly earning from advertisements. It is today's most successful advertising company, with its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., regardless of what kind of function it is, it is all a Meta flow channel.
Not only this, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many Apps connecting to it through its advertising platform, thus achieving transformation.
However, times have changed.
Due to the adjustment of the privacy policy of Apple, it is difficult to get user data information again, which affects the efficiency of advertisement spending.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, it will be very obvious to users whether they allow the app to get their information, most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google further sharpens its sword and cuts into the Meta's income, the impact will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor weakened in the Meta's income growth before (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of the company's income comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies engaged in maritime business.
There are about 100 people in the office of Meta in Hong Kong, and there are several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas market, and Metta is the only reliable advertising platform. Spending a lot of money is a must.
One of the major competitors of TT is Meta, but in the past two years Meta has made a lot of money from the Chinese market.
Agents from all over China have been helping each other to promote their businesses on the Chinese social media platform, Weibo. The performance of the Chinese region on Weibo has been very successful.
I haven't been specializing in it lately, but I'm sure it will be better than before.
The stage of China's large-scale overseas money burning has already passed.
The third, the expansion of the new flow channel is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, with new platforms such as TikTok and WeChat becoming increasingly popular. They are no longer in the Meta hands.
The biggest problem is not only a decrease in income, but also a lack of growth expectation.
Not only do we need to look at current income from the capital market, but it is also important to consider our expectations for the future.
It became clear very soon that the expectations for Meta were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zack Brown talked about “The Universe”.
The universe should be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the universe is relatively long, so this story should not be able to support the value of Meta in three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be more difficult than ever for Meta.
Don't look at the face of the book now, it is very dangerous. Every year, there is 1,000 million to 2,000 million US dollars of income, but the real sense of danger is very strong, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies. There is no good security of the castle river.
Although his social media presence is currently higher than ever, it is still a popular social media platform, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of TikTok, he has no confidence, and it is a stealthy tactics.
Concepts such as the universe and time are often difficult to comprehend, and are rarely achieved within a short period of time. Therefore, the risk of changing companies is extremely high, as it involves constant exploration for new paths. However, I believe that his choice of path is wrong, as it is a deviation from the right course.

The Chinese and Vietnamese armies concluded their joint peacekeeping and rescue exercise “Peaceful Rescue 2021” on the New Year’s Eve. The exercise was held in the border area of China and Vietnam from December 22 to 31. The two armies conducted various types of rescue and peacekeeping operations, including medical aid, search and rescue, and evacuation. The exercise was a success and concluded with a grand closing ceremony.
On December 12th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Vietnam People's Army jointly held the "Peacekeeping Rescue - 2021" exercise in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a delegation to participate in the exercise. All the members of the delegation safely returned to China. This marks the successful completion of the 7-day exercise.
This joint performance was a great challenge to the people's democratic medical rescue mission. We had to work hard and stay vigilant to ensure the success of the mission. We had to take effective measures to rescue the injured, treat the wounded, and provide medical aid to the people in need. We also had to establish a unified command and control system, unified rescue and relief system, and standardized medical treatment system to ensure the success of the mission. This enhanced the joint rescue and relief capabilities of the two armies.
After practicing hard, I was able to get the approval of the two armies.
The Vice Chairman of the Exercise Instruction and Guidance Committee of the People's Army of Vietnam, Long Van Xuan, spoke at the conclusion of the exercise, saying that through this exercise, the Vietnamese military doctors learned the knowledge of the exercise organization and professional activities from the Chinese side. They also saw the medical and safety equipment of the Chinese side.
The results of the exercise proved the professional ability of the two countries' military medical forces in the fields of medical assistance, epidemic control and disaster relief.
The Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Wang Hongguang, expressed that this exercise was a continuation of the successful organization of the Joint Medical Exercise in 2018, which was a great opportunity to explore new ideas and practices. He believed that this exercise had great significance.
During the period of practice, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, rapid HIV test kits and other health prevention materials to the Vietnam People's Army.
