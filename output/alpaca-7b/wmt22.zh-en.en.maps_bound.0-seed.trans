The students of Zhejiang University performed at the annual meeting of the university and showed their research achievements, which made people amazed.
Using the air to wash hands, smell of the air to diagnose disease, accurately searching for the source of fog, last night at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking scientific achievements were awarded prizes.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, covering the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities, and education. Students began from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical values, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biometric sensors: Your family doctor can check your health.
The School of Biomedical Engineering PhD student Zhang Dingming led a team to demonstrate a smartphone-sized biometric sensor at the scene.
"All you need to do is take a deep breath and blow into the instrument, which can then detect your body's basic health condition from the breath component."
Zhang Dingfang introduced the sensor and smartphone connection, which will display health reports on the phone after the alarm is triggered.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market. Common physical parameters that can be detected include temperature and heart rate.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as graphite, to detect chemical elements precisely and sense the body's health condition accurately.
Smart Surgical Lamp: Doctors' High-Tech Visual Aid
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the surgery room.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Swiss Invention Exhibition.
Zhu Lin, Jun Feng and their team at the Optoelectronics and Photonics School discovered a new approach to tackle the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented a smart LED surgical lamps.
Many diseases can be detected in the early stage and removed timely, and there is a relationship between the light used in the doctor's office and the surgery.
Shen Jifeng said, "If the doctor can't see the tumor tissues clearly during the early check of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread later."
This type of smart surgical light has four light bulbs, which can be adjusted to enhance the difference between different organizations under the light by adjusting the light spectrum.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the patient's habits and needs.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, the affiliated children's hospital of Zhejiang University, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the Challenge Cup 1st Prize.
Washing hands with air: Saving water, more fun!
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with a towel, squeezing out the handkerchief, and Li Qui Zhang and his classmates invented a set of "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the hand washing device, our weight can be compressed and expelled from the air.
He was like an agitator.
The compressed air that was released formed a fluid and combined with the water at the dragon's head.
This way, we can get our hands clean!
Experimental evidence shows that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as regular hand washing.
This device only needs our own gravity as a power source, ensuring cleanliness, saving up to 90% of water, and completely energy-saving and environment-friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Great Challenge Summit, this invention shined brightly and won the only gold award in many world-renowned universities.
Please arrange the refund quickly, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the money, do not collect points, it will not be used again! #PRS_ORG#!
Bones and spicy soup are not suitable for small children to eat.

I cancelled the order immediately.
I bought it, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can you change it?
Either cancel the order or not.
That's annoying.
I feel that one Emergency Certificate is very meaningful.
This is one of the important skills certificates I feel is necessary besides a driver's license!
Explaining: Emergency response is actually doing first aid, which is to rescue people before the rescue car arrives.
Everyone knows that the rescue process of the ambulance after the accident is still important, but it is the most crucial time.
This was the time when help was needed urgently.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, gold four minutes!
Therefore, the people nearby are so important for rescue!
When faced with a dangerous situation, we should not just stand still and do nothing, but instead use our professional knowledge to rescue the person, rather than feeling helpless.
In China, there are about 300 million people who die from unexpected deaths every year, which is the most dangerous one called sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average rescue rate is 15%.
In the casino hotel of Las Vegas, 78% of the people can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are both below 1%.
This is what Lu Lei, the founder of the first reaction, said.
If someone experiences cardiac arrest, no breathing, no pulse, and you perform CPR on them, it will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to potentially save a person's life.
I discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of insight to learn emergency rescue skills, but when the situation arises, they come too late. Therefore, I would like to call on everyone to take the time to learn this skill, so that we can make timely reactions in the face of emergencies.
Even if the situation is unstable, we can still save one person's life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross Training Center. I am registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai and I have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself 25 years ago. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the list of goals was done several months ago, but it was definitely accomplished!
After I had finished preparing for the other exams I was planning to take, I decided to take the Diving Certificate and the Diving Rescue Certificate as well. According to the Little Red Book, having the Diving Rescue Certificate would be useful for taking the Diving Certificate. Therefore, having the Diving Rescue Certificate would be very helpful for taking the Diving Certificate!

There's only one 13-yuan shrimp dumpling in the whole place!?
I haven't tried it yet.
How can I #NAME# without writing it clearly?
How much is one supposed to pay for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# lost a lot of food, so this time I'm going to eat a shrimp dumpling!
Because I entered the code beforehand, I was able to see it was valid.
Firstly, I believe "The Four Seasons" is a multi-faceted film, speaking from various perspectives.
But you have to say this movie is not a bright point and it is not at least entertaining.
There are many different kinds of movies, allowing you to relax and fall asleep in the cinema, and then feel guilty afterwards. 'Four Hills' is like a monkey on the mountain, able to use innumerable ways to ignite your anger.
On this point, Han Cang really is a heaven-sent gentleman.
The most painful thing in the film is the imitation of a Buddha in the kung fu novel, which is hard to identify and has many holes like a gust of wind on the protagonist's body.
After you finish watching it, you will be doubtful whether there is a hidden message from the director in it. However, when you think carefully, it is just a joke.
Firstly, I find it difficult to understand some circumstances.
The male head of the household should live in a south-facing location on a small island, with his wife as his lifelong companion.
She wished to go and see the snow in the east, so her father arranged for a big uncle to take her in a small slew car to travel to the east and see the snow.
Old people sitting in a car from the south to the east to see snow?
He and his father were very relaxed about it.
After that, this old man didn't have any more text to read.
How did she get the license to operate a hotel on a derelict boat?
Why can the Flying Car Party easily make a smooth road out of a difficult mountain road?
Then the car stopped in the middle of the road, and the four drivers around it were unable to find the car.
This tool is too obvious.
Why would a party of lawbreakers and suspected criminals become a police officer?
Why didn't the protagonist report the high-interest loan in the movie? The police officer asked him whether there was any difficulty.
A grown-up person was unable to use a smartphone, yet knew how to use a room card to open the door of a hotel, but was unable to find the hotel's staff. He then had to sleep outside the room door.
The entire film was filled with such complicated and mysterious plot points that it was almost impossible to remember them all. This made the movie quite frustrating to watch.
Besides the plot, the movie was boring and had no main idea, it was just a mess of unrelated scenes.
After watching the movie for 20 minutes, you might think it was a comedy, but after another 10 minutes, you might think it was an inspirational drama, depicting the struggles of young people in the rural town to survive. After the movie was over, you were left with a deep sense of confusion, wondering why you had gone to watch it in the first place.
For most people, the path of various types of films is already very familiar, such as you want to make a movie car stunt, then you need to be ambitious + comic and tell the audience one step by step how a lucky bird is walking towards success.
If you want to take a romance picture, then you just need to be realistic, honest, and tell the story of two young people in a small town and their service staff.
If you want to reflect real life, then the most important thing is to avoid introducing things that are out of the ordinary in the normal world.
For example, the character of Yitzhak in the musical "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" was burnt alive and then still managed to sing.
Even though the female lead was not very intelligent, she was able to perform well in certain aspects, like a 5-year-old child. I don't know if this was due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I was also confused, why did Han Cang become so passionate about adding a car crash scene to his own movie?
Why would the movie arrangement be so tightly packed in the Spring Festival holiday?

The modern apprenticeship school in Chengdu is now recruiting students. Upon admission, they will become company employees.
Yesterday, reporters from the city education committee learned that this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" model of human resource development in 60 schools, accepting students who have undergone trial training and simultaneously possessing the "apprentice" identity. After being enrolled, they will be pre-hired as unit employees by the trial enterprises.
The Education Bureau requires part-time schools to follow the regulations, recruit and employ workers, sign a tripartite agreement, and determine the specific job positions, teaching contents, and rights and interests of students in accordance with the two-way selection principle. For students aged 16 and below, the school, employer, and employee must sign a four-party agreement.
Schools should adopt a modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with businesses to provide employees with front-line training and job rotation training.
Schools should reform their talent cultivation models.
The school and company jointly designed a talent cultivation program, to jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, teacher qualification standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
An internship cycle consists of an on-the-job training, student's practical time is determined according to their professional skills development plan, and a top-level internship usually lasts for 6 months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based learning management system should be implemented according to the characteristics of different specialties, one teacher can take 2-5 students to form a learning group, ensure the students acquire the necessary skills for each learning position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern education pilots, with each pilot having 50 to 60 students. In total, 3000 students will be trained.
According to the principle of trial and error, step by step advancement from the initial point, exploring and establishing a comprehensive recruitment, training and integration of human resources, practical enhancement of student's employment ability, improving student's employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctors: AIDS is a powerful disease but multiple diseases are common.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new variant of the Coronavirus is more contagious and spreads faster than SARS.
According to the Associated Press, the spread of AIDS in South Africa has led to the formation of doctors' organizations. Doctors in the province of Kwazulu-Natal have reported that the symptoms of the new cases of AIDS are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever similar to flu symptoms.
The organization's overall director Unben Pillay said that he has to see around 10 patients a day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
Paul said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days."
He said, this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more prone to contracting serious illnesses due to the virus.
He said, compared to the previous outbreak, the patients he treated in the current one had difficulty breathing and had low hemoglobin levels.
Many people have to stay in the hospital within days.
Doctors in Africa reported the first case of Ebola virus infection and shared similar experiences within two weeks.
Although we have collected enough data, it still needs a few weeks time. The doctor's observation and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the severe cases of the new coronavirus were found among the hospitalized patients, which is half of the proportion of the first wave of the epidemic. The average hospital stay time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the recent cases, only 3% died, while in South Africa the early cases had a mortality rate of up to 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, cited data and other reports to say: “Currently, almost all the evidence suggests that this is a mild disease.”
He also said, "We need to wait for the later data."
Under normal circumstances, the time interval between hospitalization and death is relatively late, and we have entered this epidemic time only two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing current vaccines and treatments.
Although Deltata is still the most prevalent pandemic, cases of COVID-19 are now appearing in dozens of countries, including South Africa, where there are hundreds of cases.
According to the health department, the number of new cases of illness in Guangdong Province in December increased by 400%. Tests showed that the majority of the cases were infected with the novel virus.
Thank you to today's supporters, we have sent out all 80 boxes!

Education evaluation: What should we do to save the children?
If the famous public service advertisement of "No buying, no selling, just killing" is compared to the popular "No harm, no foul" mentality, then in a good environment without coercion, the prevention of crime will be more effective, the risk of harm will be minimized, the cost will be high, and the crime will not occur.
Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department announced the launch of a platform for urgent dissemination of information on child abduction.
This is the authoritative platform for publishing information about lost children, and quickly finding the lost children with the help of the Internet.
After hearing the name of this App, "Tuan Yuan", I felt warm and cozy.
The new technology is not only named "Wen Yi" (art) and filled with emotion, but also information-ified application is practical and effective.
To apprehend the perpetrator and to recover the abducted child is the primary goal, to ensure the safety of the child and their family's freedom.
Only then is it the trial and punishment of the suspected person.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to law education, can be listed as many "big words".
However, before breaking the case, it is important to prioritize the victim's personal safety.
In times of crisis, it is difficult to find a balance between the heavy burden of responsibility and the urgency of the situation. For example, the debate on whether or not to impose capital punishment on child traffickers is a highly controversial topic. We must be cautious and considerate when discussing it.
According to the experience of handling such cases, human traffickers tend to get away as soon as possible after committing the crime.
Searching for a missing child can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The further the child is from home, the more challenging it will be to find them.
Under such circumstances, extracting information from platforms like "Quick Circle" can be directly helpful in cracking cases, searching for missing children, which is an effective action.
After all, "putting down the bandits" was a task that required the entire legal system to be put in place.
To perfect the law from its perfection to its enforcement, as well as to protect the interests of parents and children, we must adhere to the spirit of "defending the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can still be done better.
For example, a common case, a family of three was taking a rest at the train station, but they were so tired that they fell asleep, only to wake up and find that their child was missing.
Parents cannot expect a two-year-old to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, they should at least have some basic protective awareness.
The parents and the child took a break to relax, and then they put the child under the protection of stability, which was the most effective preventive measure against child abduction.
From the perspective of the police, cracking down on illegal activities is important. But from another perspective, it is also important to pay attention to and supervise the children who are involved in the illegal activities.
A single person's unlawful act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese Criminal Law, the punishment for selling children for crime is 5 years in prison; if the situation is especially serious, the death penalty can be given, and all the criminal's assets will be confiscated.
Starting point of punishment and maximum punishment are lightening up in the trend of leniency, selling of children's crime is clearly a serious crime.
There are still many shoplifting cases happening every year.
It is clear that some people's attitudes towards child rearing have become more lax, with their legal awareness becoming increasingly blurred.
Legal education for this group should be synchronized and progressed.
To effectively control illegal sales, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement of laws and regulations by the government.
If there is a wide presence of the market, the sellers will be eager to make profits and continuously innovate selling methods, thus forming a confrontational relationship with the buyers and creating a situation of low efficiency.
Therefore, by understanding the concept of law, crime prevention can be improved, such as by reducing the occurrence of shoplifting and childhood crime.
Yang Huan spoke about the 19th National Congress of the CCP and the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CCP Central Committee and the Provincial and Municipal CCP Congresses at Mountain of Mao.
Drawing power from the Party's century-long struggle history.
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th, the provincial committee, the propaganda department, and the party chief, Yang Huan, delivered a speech at the video creation base in Ma'an Mountain, deeply studying the spirit of the 19th Party Congress of the CPC and learning to practice the important instructions of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the CPC. They also studied the spirit of the 12th Provincial Congress of the CPC.
Yang Huan from the ideal of faith and pioneering spirit, self-revolution and young pioneers, the Party's leadership and the Party's theory, three aspects, combined with his own experience and personal experience, in-depth and superficially, comprehensively expounded the core spirit of the whole meeting and the requirements of practice.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches of Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang with the spirit of the provincial party congress and the spirit of the important instructions of Xi Jinping, and study hard, unite and strengthen the defense of the "two establishments" and do the "two maintenance" with the spirit of self-awareness, political awareness and action awareness. We should adhere to the direction of the guidance of Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang.
During the interactive dialogue, the representatives of the grassroots, enterprises and young people discussed the relationship between the three historic decisions, the meaning of the "two establish" decision, how to grasp the direction of the enterprise, and how the young people of the new era can draw power from the century-long party history. Yang He, using a common language and vivid examples, answered the questions from the young party members, and firmly believed that from the party's century-long struggles, they should draw the power of advancing and tightly unite with the central leadership.
According to the preliminary estimates, the number of graduating students in the Beijing region in 2022 is expected to reach 26.8 million.
On December 11th, 2021, the reporter from Beijing News, Yan Na, attended the 2022 Beijing High School Graduation Employment and Entrepreneurship Video Conference held by the Beijing Education Commission, Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, and gained some insights. According to statistics, the number of graduating high school students in Beijing in 2022 is estimated to reach 26.8 million, an increase of 1.6 million people compared to last year.
The person in charge of the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau expressed that they will implement measures such as enhancing demand matching, strengthening policy support, expanding job channels, providing employment assistance, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving service efficiency in order to promote the employment of college graduates in Beijing.
The Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will build an experimental platform to increase job supply, actively contact 40 universities to provide internship experience for graduates, visit enterprises to recruit people, integrate job information and vacancy information, focus on "six-pack" recruitment, i.e. recruiting one person from each of the six categories, recruiting one person from each of the state-owned enterprises, recruiting one person from each of the grass-roots projects, and providing job experience for one person from each family. The "One Life, One Plan" dynamic management will ensure that each graduate has at least five job recommendations, and will provide full support for those who are facing difficulty in finding a job.
In reality, I don't know whether it was the store's mistake or my own mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Investigation was unable to be completed.
I hope you will understand this.
Because the delivery time was displayed faster than 30 minutes.
No need, thank you.
It has already changed hands.
He had been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been talking about the process.

The International Olive Council will divide olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
The original castor oil or known as natural castor oil, is directly obtained from the fresh fruit material of castor oil plant by mechanical chilling and filtration processes to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
The flavor of the plant was delicate and aromatic, with a acidity level no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Oil (FVO): The acidity is slightly high, but it does not exceed 2%, with a pure and delicate flavor and aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Oil: Flavor and Aroma are still acceptable, Acidity should not exceed 3.3%.
The refined olein oil obtained after the refining of olive oil with an acidity degree of over 3.3% is called "secondary oil".
Refined palm oil can be divided into two levels.
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil in order to achieve a balance of flavor, aroma and color. Its acidity should be under 1.5%, and it should be transparent and golden yellow in color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Is obtained by extracting and refining olive pomace oil through a chemical process.
You should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
Pineapples are similar to grapes in making wine, with different varieties of pineapples from different regions and species producing different grades of pineapple oil.
The best place for the growth of oil palm is:
The coastal and offshore areas have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for oil palm growth, such as temperature, sunshine, humidity and rainfall.
Except for coastal areas, other regions can only be planted in suitable areas.
Major production area:(Inland Sea)
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, France, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, South Africa, etc. have similar climates to those in the South.
Harvest month of Oil palm.
From March to June, the flowers of the oil tree bloom and fruit starts to grow and mature. The color of the fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for collecting fruit in the orchard (the freshness of the oil can be very important).
The nutrients of olive oil are:
The rich fatty acids in olive oil include oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Vegetable Oil has been found to be the most suitable oil for human body nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The plenary session of the National People's Congress has ended, and the Chairman has stepped down. The torch of freedom will never be extinguished.
The Online Summit for Democracy, attended by over 110 countries' government and civil society leaders and private sector representatives, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
Biden spoke about censorship in the world and the Fire of Freedom burned in everyone's heart. The authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish it.
He also expressed his plan to convene the second Global People's Congress in 2020.
The Taiwanese government representative, political advisor Tang Fong and other activists from the Hong Kong democracy movement, such as Joshua Wong, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know that the work that is being done in front of us is immense and daunting."
However, we also know that we can accept the challenge, as I said before, just as this summit has demonstrated, the democratic world is still alive.
The flame of freedom can never be extinguished, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden still expressed, democracy needs the entire society's common effort.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be mindful of those who put their own interests before the public good."
The second day of the National People's Congress focused on defending human rights, preserving democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is coincidentally "International Human Rights Day".
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democracy movement is facing a challenge on a global scale, particularly due to the new digital technology.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values and standpoints, as well as our democratic spirit."
It requires in-depth social dialogue, to tackle inequality, fight corruption, update social contracts, and invest in quality education, to expand women's and girls' opportunities.
This also requires relentless accountability of all forms of nationalism, localism, and radicalism, including the use of all tools provided by the technology revolution.
A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, by pre-recording a video message, to remind and keep the attention of the Council on the human rights situation of the ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been affected by the Chinese rising, yet no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
We must utilize all the resources we possess to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task.
Luo Guanzhong also urged the world to unite against the threat of communism.
He said, "Perhaps some people in the middle are afraid of losing the Chinese market, or they don't understand (the Communist Party)'s threat to our democratic values.
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
In the discussion of "fighting against digital authoritarianism and defending democratic values", Tang Feng released a video statement titled "National Declaration" to emphasize that Taiwan is standing at the frontline against authoritarianism and oppression.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the novel coronavirus through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "At the frontline of democracy in Taiwan, we will always stand firm and resist the authoritarianism of global power. We also strive to promote global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic period, authoritarian governments around the world have been rationalizing violations of human rights by claiming to prioritize public health and collective interests. This has resulted in a retreat of global democracy, as evidenced by the signs of the times.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down the flag to fight fake news.
At the same time as the second day of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's meeting was held, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for serious violations of human rights. It also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that had been found to use surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

I know that.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time was always delayed.
Originally, it was #NUMBER#
I didn't call him.
He didn't eat.
I will definitely file a lawsuit.
You didn't send it yet, why are you still talking about it?
You waited so long for me.
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to send the goods to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.

I want to cancel the order.
Why didn't you give me a cancellation?
Hi, the live chicken that was sent to the restaurant is here.
I want to try playing tennis but I'm afraid of myself, so I'm looking for an affordable price to take lessons first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price tends to be higher than the friendly level, if you can not distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap bargain, this kind of "entry-level" shooting is industrial waste.
They have very low strength, the ball can be easily lifted up to the sky, the vibration is very big, the hard ball can't be stopped, the skilled players are difficult to control.
The logic and slang of basketball are difficult to understand, but you can't learn it and you can't buy expensive things. You can make it cheap and easy by playing two times, so you won't have to fight again. This way, basketball will be easy and inexpensive.
When you can distinguish good from bad, it means you have made progress. Come back and buy expensive things here, and I'll make two times the money.
Suggestion: Buy a used camera, such as a Prince or Dynax, since these brands have no prestige and are thus reasonably priced. Used cameras for 500-600 yuan are good enough, while 200 yuan used cameras are worth the enjoyment.
Friendly to newcomers, but once past the beginner's stage, it's too late for most people, especially women.
The order has been delayed several times and the delivery date has not been confirmed.
Can you help?

Thank you.
Is that so? I already have credit, right?
Do I need to re-order the same thing again? It was already ordered once.
Hello, the food at this restaurant was missing many ingredients, and the chicken soup was also not cooked properly.

Within 3 years, the training of 10000 rural primary school music teachers in Jiangxi will be completed.
Reporters from the South China Morning Post visited the Education Bureau in Jiangxi Province on May 22nd and learned that the bureau had been providing training to teachers in rural areas since 2016. The bureau has been providing 1000 teachers with training, with each teacher receiving training once and the total number of teachers reaching 1000. This has enabled the bureau to enhance the capacity of teachers in rural areas, achieve balanced development of rural education, and ensure equitable access to quality education for rural students.
According to the understanding, the trainees are primary and secondary school teachers in rural areas of Jiangxi Province with basic knowledge of music, art, and physical education, who can also teach other subjects.
Through training, they acquired basic knowledge and teaching skills of music and art education, updated their teaching concepts and attitudes, learned modern teaching methods, improved their ability of activity design and campus culture, and built a team of multi-functional music and art teachers, thus alleviating the shortage of rural music and art teachers.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of music, art, and physical education training in Jiangxi, 100 counties (cities, districts) will each send 1 trainer, totaling 300 trainers. This will enhance their teaching demonstration, curriculum design, and organization skills, as well as their instruction, research, and network-building capabilities. They will also serve as teachers, demonstrations, guides, and supervisors.
After waiting for 20 minutes, I have already waited for 1 hour. #NUMBER# minutes.

Hello, it will take a long time before the food is delivered.
Home already received worker.
Your phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, and your name is #NAME#.
You owe me a reasonable exchange.
You can, but your motorcycle has a lot of problems, so it's troublesome to handle.
Can you check if it is still on the road? If possible, send it there immediately.
If there is nothing, then return the money for the meal.
In reality, there is much to consider when dressing and accessorizing for a petite girl with body image issues.
The girl can't wear a skirt that is too short or too long, the difference should be just around the knee, and it can cover up the legs perfectly.
If the skirt is too short, it will cause the fat on the legs to be exposed.
When you are too tall, you will feel embarrassed and bloated.
If you wear different colors of clothing, such as a dress, skirt and long socks, you will look more natural. The different colors of the clothing can make your body look longer and slimmer.
In reality, many petite girls are wearing deep colors such as black, navy, and burgundy as their uniforms, which the author has deep understanding of. Deep colors are also a good way to hide their body shapes, while the high-end and elegant black skirt is their first choice.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a black skirt, will make you appear thinner.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The larger the population, the more colorful it is. However, the colors should not be too bright and vivid.
When people pay attention to your leg and foot, they will get the feeling of being fat.
For the little girl who is slightly chubby, it is important to teach her how to dress and accessorize properly.
Don't wear too tight or short skirts, as it will make you look uncomely. If your legs are too thick, you can wear a long black or net-like skirt, or a floral-print skirt, which is soft and comfortable. Finally, choose a loose and flowing top to go with the skirt, which will help to hide the girl's plumpness.
Of course, the petite girl also has a lot of charm when she wears short skirts.
The fat girl should choose the same color for the short skirt and the top, so that the fat girl's bulky figure will have an increase in height effect.
Wearing shorts and high heels can make your legs look longer and slimmer, which is the hottest combination for the summer!
If you are plus-sized but have slim legs, we recommend you choose the elegant skirt and top set.
Not only can it block out large pores, but it can also showcase your advantages.
A short skirt will make one look slim, which is suitable for plus-sized girls, and the top should be chosen tightly to create a layered and slimming effect.
A simple white T-shirt and a pair of shorts can also be tried on by those who are curvier.
The chubby girl can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they can grasp the rules of dressing well, even the thin girls will become the focus of attention.
In terms of clothing and accessories, there have been changes, but in life we should also move more, strive to break away from the label of "little fat girl" early in the morning.

Girls donating money to help their sisters who were injured in an accident - New China Net.
A young girl stood in front of a wooden plank on the Hangzhou Wulin Square. The wooden plank had the words “human flesh and blood” and “10 yuan one arrow” written on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl in Hangzhou donating money to charity with the caption “Giving is Fun” went viral on WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden plank which is slightly taller than the average person. The plank has the words “human target” and “10 yuan one arrow” written on it. This implies that after paying for the arrow, the person can use a bow and arrow to shoot the target.
This behavior triggered a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Branch announced that the responsible person had verified the news to the reporter from Xinhua News. The police confirmed that the girl had done such an exuberant act, but this kind of behavior is not worth encouraging. After warning, the girl had left the local police station.
The girl was photographing a "paparazzi" on the street, and asked for donations.
On the internet, a long-haired girl wearing a "ghost" mask stood in front of a wooden board, writing "human flesh bullet, 10 yuan one arrow" in black ink on the board. In front of her, there was another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat/Alipay numbers written.
That picture caused a controversy after it was posted on the Internet.
Some people think this is "bullying" behavior, but many others expressed sympathy.
We arrived at the square at around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd and found the situation had changed drastically. The crowd had already dispersed.
The police station near the scene of the incident accepted the media interview of the local people, and the two girls, aged 20, were dressed up in a youthful and beautiful manner.
A girl was crying in the middle of the road, begging the people around to play the game with her. Another girl was standing beside her, helping her drink and talking about her sick sister who needs an urgent surgery fee. Please help them.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister, who has leukemia.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City Xiaoshan Branch informed the reporter of the New Beijing News that the girl's name is Jiaqi Li, and she is 13 years old. She donated money to her sister, who is also named Jiaqi Li.
Although treatment costs still require 30 million yuan, people were at a loss as to how to donate, making it impossible to do so.
He said, during the entire process, two girls were the lookouts, one responsible for holding the gun and the other one was just observing, but neither of them fired any shots. All they did was take pictures and post them on Weibo.
The police department identified the offenders and confiscated their bows and arrows which did not belong to the regulated scope.
The responsible person expressed that, “ We do not advocate adopting this kind of fundraising method.”
After the police warned her, she had already left the police station.
The heat dissipation effect is good, the thinness degree is convenient, the exterior material is satisfactory, and the price-performance ratio is very high.
The new machine is very good.
Performance stability, four outlets dissipate heat without any problem, worth recommending.
This game is really great, it's perfect for leisure and it's made of high quality materials!
The price of the gaming laptop is still not worthwhile.
I think the gameplay of Heroes of the Storm is good, with a soothing effect, able to play most games, the frame rate is stable, very smooth, lol is not present, CSgo is easy to win, most 3a games can be played.
Cooling Effect: The cooling effect is good, the fan is very powerful, the working effect is quite comfortable, the gaming effect is still impressive.
The visual quality of the game is impressive, with a cool and exciting atmosphere. The graphics display effect is very clear on the screen, and the game is smooth enough at 1080p.
Buying a notebook feels so satisfying, mainly for design purpose. The price-quality ratio is very high, lighter than expected, and more beautiful than imagined. The red color of the ass is a very good-looking color of wine, not as floral as expected. It exceeds expectations in many aspects, and is a great purchase. Girls will also find it suitable.
Two years ago, he began to contact the Grim Reaper on his motorcycle, and it has been two years since then. The experience has been costly and of poor quality!

He had intended to buy the foreigners a gift, but he was too late and had to buy it in advance, so he missed out on the 418 Bank activities. He was a bit disappointed.

The article "Quick Look! An Olympic Project Manager Can Crush Any Giant Brand" in the front section of the newspaper was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can always be the first to act and no one can match them in their daily routine of shifting bricks, taking risks, and working overnight. They also have the skills to save fires, bake pizzas, and face any challenges.
This article is like a funny joke, but it also reflects the daily struggles of project managers and their bitterness. It represents the true spirit of current project management work.
Employees who are engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to take action to make themselves free from the difficulties in the work.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certified professionals increases every year, more and more project management professionals are able to enhance their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the 2019 China Project Management Development Report, the total number of people who have taken the PMP exam in China has reached 600,000, with 420,000 people obtaining the PMP certification, accounting for 31.2% of the global total.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing steadily, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on simple and straightforward approaches can no longer bring success. The ever-changing work environment makes us realize that we need to learn and explore new paths.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can one be assured of smooth project management work without any obstacles?
Many beginner project managers expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they were able to gain a systematic understanding of project management's ten domains and five process groups, however, when it came to actually managing projects, they still felt like they were wading through a sea of fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, absence of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and workflow support, unable to keep track of the progress, unrealistic project estimation, lack of project management sensitivity and flexibility; unclear division of labor, team members not working efficiently, "old oil barrel" not knowing how to address cross-departmental communication, project progress difficult to promote.
As a result, our focus on product innovation and development management has helped numerous excellent companies to nurture and grow their product managers and project managers, as well as to win the honor of “China’s Corporate Development Management Talent Training Base” and “Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Course”.
The online course 'Developing Project Manager Training' is an effective way to learn project management skills, by combining real-world case studies, tools and methods from various development-focused companies. It helps you acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to become an effective project manager and take your career to the next level.
This is also an opportunity to let the enterprise use lower costs and less investment, to promote the project manager's training process, to bring efficient operation results to the enterprise.
With hard work, you can even evaluate other students' opinions on this course: This course is not only taught by China Hua Xia experts (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many famous companies' real-world business scenarios, providing in-depth and shallow explanations of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as a rich template form to help students convert their learning outcomes into practical work.

EasyTrip "Double Twelve" Evening Advertising to Consumers to Advocate Rational Consumption - Economy Observer Website - Professional Economic News Website.
This year's Double Eleven Shopping Festival saw a total of 1.77 trillion yuan in online payments, an increase of 20.3% over last year.
The Chinese government has been giving out large and generous red envelopes to stimulate consumption, leading to a surge in consumption and a boost in the economy. On the one hand, this has caused people to be more excited about national consumption and to spend more. On the other hand, it has also caused us to become more passive and to reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
Before arriving at the “Double Twelve” shopping festival, JD.com (short for Jingdong) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to build good consumption habits and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 2020 Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Report, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, higher by 2.04 than in 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese citizens in terms of financial consumption is better, but there is still a large difference in terms of financial behavior and skills. We need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Older people and younger people have relatively low financial literacy levels, and “one-child” policies will remain a focus of financial education for some time. The report published by Norilsk Finance and the Central Bank of China on the debt situation of young people and the 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report released by CCTV Finance show that young people have a huge consumption potential, credit and consumption are important growth paths, and 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the young people do not have debt, but they have irrational consumption habits, and some of them have excessive consumption, frivolous consumption behavior, and thus generate excessive debt and risk. Some even lead to social problems, and financial institutions should be brave and take on social responsibility. They should provide correct guidance in a positive direction.
As a long-term, sustainable consumer finance institution, we always strive to provide quality and caring services to help build a happy life for the people. We advocate for rational and correct consumption attitude, and actively respond to regulatory calls to improve the rational consumption awareness of the people, especially the young.
Over the past few years, we have been dedicated to promoting financial literacy among young people in China through various forms of activities, such as organizing innovation competitions, launching creative campaigns, and collaborating with top-tier universities to create a healthy consumption environment. This has helped young people to form rational consumption habits, plan their consumption demands rationally, and gradually accumulate their life wealth.

The People's Daily Online - The South China Sea Cooperation Committee Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover station of the King of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, includes the countries of Aman, Al-Arab League (Arabia), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this was Saudi Arabia and its Arab League allies' implementation of a blockade against Qatar in 2017, resulting in the Gulf crisis to date, with Mohammed bin Salman becoming the first Saudi ruler to visit Qatar since the crisis began.
In this critical situation, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain and Egypt have broken off their diplomatic relations and imposed a comprehensive blockade on Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, Iran has a close relationship with Qatar.
The strained diplomatic tensions have had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes to Katar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 January Maritime Cooperation Committee meeting, when the participating countries signed a solution proposed by the US and China to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are currently appointing new ambassadors to Cairo and are exerting efforts to restore their relationship with Cairo.
The Arab countries and Cuba must resolve their differences in order to restore their relationship, which is necessary for the benefit of each country and the stability of the region. They must join forces to confront common challenges.
During the visit of Sheikh Khalifa to Abu Dhabi, both sides agreed to open up two land routes connecting neighboring countries.
The 725-km-long transportation corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of the two countries' citizens.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion US dollars in Abu Dhabi, and the two countries' companies have signed a memorandum of understanding worth 300 billion US dollars.
The Saudi King Salman's visit to the Persian Gulf countries was to discuss the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, which the Arab countries had accused of being unable to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Each coastal country has always seen Iran as a long-term rival and perceived Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country in the region considered the issue of Iran's missile activities as a problem that could not be resolved, and failed to take any action to contain Iran's activities in the region. This was a dangerous weakness.
In the wake of the failure of the talks between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program, Saudi Arabia and Iran have begun direct negotiations.
The target is to upgrade the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the slowdown of the Sino-US economic cooperation.
The upcoming Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok, Thailand, will be the first time since the end of the long-running disputes between some of the member countries and Cambodia that all 10 member countries will be gathering together.
This is an opportunity to promote the unity of the East Asian community and to make a contribution to the recovery of the East Asian cooperation process. At the same time, various measures should be proposed to ensure the full cooperation of the member states, to tackle common challenges, and to promote the stability and development of the East Asian countries.
From 7:00 to 9:30, I still haven't sent it off, so I have to return the money and cancel the order.
Good
The sound of air pollution in the New District of Shanghai is the loudest!
This car we brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar from Lamborghini - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the car is near two hundred million yuan, and the road tax for one year is about ten thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Because you have the power of 700 horses, can you imagine how fast it can be?
The editor didn't know that either, the data says that acceleration from 0 to 100km/h only needs 2.9 seconds, which is roughly the same as myvi's 30km/h speed, wow.
The low-slung car body, the aggressive scalpel-like door handles, the pervasive sense of power emanating from the huge exhaust pipe, and the luminous glass interior of the 6.5 v12 engine - all of these elements perfectly capture the essence of the Lamborghini style.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much. Just Google it and you'll find some explanations. We've organized some of the Google results that may not be accurate.
Everyone is watching the same thing, but it's so interesting that no one wants to look away! (It's kind of cool!)
It costs about RM1 for 1km of fuel. (The car owner doesn't really care about it.)
Practice the posture of driving a car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because it will be difficult to get out of the car).
The sound of the engine was too loud, so I had to turn down the volume of my ears after getting off the car. (But it was still very comfortable.)
Your car is too big to park in the ordinary parking lot, and you're afraid of being hit by the car door when it opens!
There was a bit of loneliness because there was no one on the road. (This is what I said, unrelated to the car driver, haha)
Everyone should not make a mistake, this video is not for sale, sorry!
Want to take a video of your love car? Welcome to contact us!
You can find more car-related news from various fields at The Car Guide / People's Car Journal.
The car accident was worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both widely recognized by car enthusiasts. Chiron is the world's most expensive supercar and Porsche 911's car price is also in the million-dollar range!
Before that day, foreigners crashed a million supercars, including the Chiron, in a matter of minutes!
After seeing the results, it's clear that wisdom is priceless!
Allowing college spirit and era spirit to resonate in harmony - China News
The term "University Spirit" refers to the set of education philosophy and values pursued by a university over a long period of time during its development. It is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been an important factor in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, and has made important contributions to the progress of a nation.
From the first modern university in the world, the University was born with a unique mission and responsibility, different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, the birth of the university was in the difficult period of national crisis, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of time. It advocates the values of "righteousness, harmony and peace" and "strengthening the nation" with "love for the country".
The trend of internationalization and informatization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, leading to fierce global education competition, technology competition and human resource competition. This provides the higher education industry with a great opportunity and challenge.
The proposal of "Integrated Plan for Building a World-Class University and World-Class Academic Disciplines" displayed the Chinese government's confidence and determination to make progress in the field of higher education. It also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to quickly climb to the top of the world-class rankings in a short period of time, while still maintaining a certain distance from the base and accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and disciplines?
In addition to the three self-confidences, college should also fully exploit the three advantages: first, the post-experience advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas scholars, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieving significant improvement in academic level and quality assurance; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the Chinese civilization of 5000 years of accumulation, spreading the excellent traditional culture, thus forming a powerful cohesion of strength, creating a brand and enhancing the image; third, the system advantage, fully exploiting the superior system of socialist countries, strengthening the driving force of objectives, gathering the common sense of unity, optimizing the resource arrangement, and providing a solid guarantee for the rapid advancement of the school.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that building a world-class university requires the presence of multiple campuses, each of which should highlight its own advantages and characteristics.
Chinese-style education should have both a collective and individualistic approach, with each school cultivating its own traditions and resources, while also manifesting its own unique target positioning and educational practices.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we should pay attention to three aspects of its features: first, it emphasizes the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, and builds an integrated education and business environment to form a complete value chain of entrepreneurial education; second, it actively adjusts the optimization of the academic system, creating a favorable institutional environment for the cross-border gathering of disciplines, and actively cultivating interdisciplinary and signature cross-border achievements; third, it emphasizes the construction of an all-round service system and social service system, and actively promotes in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, accelerating the formation of a comprehensive and collaborative production and research system.
In this process, it is especially important to remain steadfast in university spirit, allowing the university spirit to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the core values of "seeking innovation", "hard work", "moral integrity", and "practical wisdom" form a new system of understanding and expression. The spirit of "opening up, awakening, and cultivating the people" and "building a strong and prosperous nation" is the latest description of the university's spirit.
This is a school that has been persisting in the correct direction of study, accumulating culture and spiritual intensity, and protecting it with great importance. It is abundant and profound in meaning.
The first emphasis is to open up and embrace diversity, manifesting a sense of pride in being able to draw talents from all over the world. The second emphasis is to pursue truth and excellence, exemplified by the tenacious pursuit of truth and moral integrity by the university. The third emphasis is to innovate and reform, combining knowledge with creativity and hard work. The fourth emphasis is to be loyal to the nation and to dedicate oneself to the nation's progress.
This series of spirit, values and pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University 120 years of education.
The wise hear silence, the clever see nothing.
China's higher education should further consolidate its position in the socialist market economy, deeply understand the historical mission and burden of the era, and speed up the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should guard the humanistic spirit of independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times interact with each other, and thus provide inexhaustible energy for the realization of national strength and ethnic revival, and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

When NFTs were released, a new concept in the encrypted community emerged.
In 2021, the blockchain game 'Axie Infinity' had a huge impact in South East Asia, causing some people to lose their job opportunities due to the pandemic. However, these people have since been able to find a stable income by playing this game.
Axie Infinity is an NFT-based pet-raising game powered by blockchain technology, featuring various play modes and has already exceeded 30 billion US dollars in transaction volume, making it the highest NFT project to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded 820 million US dollars, surpassing "King of Glory".
On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 100 million.
Axie Infinity will bring a new "palytoearn" mode to more people with the help of blockchain and intelligent contracts. Players are no longer single characters, and can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the game's ecological governance.
This kind of subjectivity cannot be granted by game developers, but instead must be ensured by blockchain technology.
I saw some news about the stock price of my friend's company, and the greatest feeling I had was the choice of the industry they had made - investment in the stock market. Firstly, they should choose a large growing industry, with a market size of at least 1000 billion yuan; secondly, they should choose an industry with good future prospects; and lastly, they should choose an industry with stable policies.
The scope of the track is determined by the market size, the length of the track is determined by the stage of the industry's development, and the track is flat or mountainous depending on the industry's rivalries.
Let's give it our all for the track!
The new year is the first task to review 2021 and adjust 2022 battle plans.
Tactics are based on the principle of "doing the right thing".
Therefore, correct strategy is "do the right thing".
Strategy is to find direction, tactics to prepare for the fight, in most military thinking, there is room for strategic thought.
For example, how to increase customer number (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider whether to deepen the current area or extend the horizontal area (Strategic Thinking). For example, how to improve customer retention rate (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider how to improve the core customer and high-value customer's retention rate (Strategic Thinking). In improving activity participation rate (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider how to set correct activity KPI, achieve correct activity target, such as improving target customer participation rate, activating inactive high-value customer, and refining silent customer. In improving DAU (Tactical Thinking) above, we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
In 2021, Bitcoin is causing a stir, with several milestones on the horizon.
On September 7, the microstate of San Marino announced that Bitcoin would be the first cryptocurrency to become a legal tender, making it the first time a cryptocurrency has been recognized as a legal tender by a country or region.
On October 12th, 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, marking the first time a cryptocurrency ETF was listed on a major US stock exchange. This signaled the expansion of cryptocurrency investments into the mainstream financial market.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork named “Taproot” which increased the anonymity of the network transactions and reduced the data burden during the transaction by changing the block's data structure.

The wedding dress photography base (in Hebei) is temporarily unavailable for rent.
Before the wedding, the makeup artist was the first to arrive and the photographer was a professional with great skills and an eye for detail. The resulting photos were of excellent quality.
The seller was very trustworthy and had a good service attitude.

Thank you photographer and makeup artist for making my wedding photos unique.
Thank you to all the staff involved in the photo shoot of the wedding gown. We are looking forward to the release of the film.
Taking wedding photos is a form of physical exercise, especially for photographers who are always running and jumping.
The makeup artist was very kind and helped me design a makeup look that suited my face. The photographer took humorous photos during the shoot, which were worth good reviews.
I am so grateful to my photographer and makeup artist, who helped me capture the moment and make me look beautiful even after so many years.

Her body was well-proportioned and attractive, and upon seeing her one could not help but think her to be a virtuous wife and a good mother. She was diligent and hardworking, and thus was able to maintain her household with ease.

The Ethnic Minority Group in Yunnan Province Sued the Government and Three Schools for Discrimination - China News
On May 23rd, the Chinese Embassy in Washington submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and Justice Department, protesting discrimination against Asian-American applicants at three universities — University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University, during the admissions process.
The Alliance for Equal Education, which initiated the lawsuit, held a news conference in Washington D.C. that day.
Group President Sue Wang spoke at the Press Conference, saying that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of US universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three US universities has generally maintained a stable level.
Research has shown that these universities in the so-called "holistic admissions" process of recruitment, "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants.
Zhao Yukun introduced the research of 2014 Stanford scholars which showed that the rate of Asian applicants admitted to the three universities was the lowest among all racial and ethnic groups.
According to the data from the US Department of Education, in all Ivy League universities, Brown and Dartmouth have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while Yale and Princeton have been practicing affirmative action for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yongkang told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped to submit a lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice could open an investigation and take necessary measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian Americans in the admissions process.
They hoped that the college would take the initiative to address this issue and change its recruitment policy for Asian students.
Currently, the three schools being sued have yet to respond.
In 2015, the Asian American Education Alliance was founded to challenge Harvard University's discriminatory admission practices, but the US Department of Education rejected the complaint for procedural reasons.
In addition to the US-Chinese Hui community, this case also involves Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Brazilian ethnic education organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yunyang, Zhejiang Province, from a real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, he decided to buy the building.
In December of the same year, Liu Xin and his family negotiated the details of buying a factory and transferring the rights to the house. On that day, they deposited 20,000 RMB in the bank as a down payment.
Lin Xu signed as the collector for the deposit in the contract of buying and selling the factory, with the contents "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties should sign the contract within one week."
However, afterward, the two sides could not reach an agreement on the major terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale, payment method, and so on, leading to a delay in signing the contract.
After considering that both sides failed to reach an agreement on the content, Lam paid 20,000 USD as a deposit and returned to Lau after several days.
It was difficult to see the house in the middle of the road, but the seller had already prepared the money and the contract, so there was nothing left but to sign the agreement, but the seller refused to sell, which made Liu Xinsheng feel helpless and angry.
In order to do this, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Ms. Lam in the Yuyao People's Court.
The court held that since the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, neither party could solely be held responsible, and it was reasonable to determine that the other party had breached the contract. Therefore, the case should not apply to a fine and penalty. The defendant was not required to assume the double liability of breach of contract.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff initiated an appeal.
Recently, the appeals court has maintained the original verdict.
Lawyers' Reminder: Be prudent and attentive in the trading process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should be prudent and attentive to the duties, such as verifying the ownership information of the house, whether the house has been occupied by people, and clearly specify the time and place of delivery in the contract, to avoid any disputes between the two sides.
After the conclusion of the German-Chinese People's Forum, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Yi, held a talk on Saturday, 11th December, to express that the US had organized the "Leaders' Forum on Democracy" which was "to caricature democracy, weaponize it, fake democracy, and stir up domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government regards the United States' long-term efforts to change its political system and value orientation as an attempt to weaken its foundation, promote "color revolutions" and unilateral sanctions, and cause disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become a major interference tool for the United States.
This time, the summit was to show the commitment of the candidates in the election.
The meeting was to be held for two days and was to be conducted via video, with 111 global leaders invited, including Taiwan's leadership, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia accused the U.S. of lacking the qualification to host such a meeting.
There are also suspicions in both the international and domestic spheres, such as criticism of inviting authoritarian leaders like those from Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who have a tendency towards special interests and are suspected of using the summit for political purposes rather than for democracy.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended the Video Democratic Convention.
The statement made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, June 13th, 2020, "Today's American-style democracy is evident in its extreme forms of capitalism, personality politics, political polarization, political radicalization, social fracturing, and racial and economic inequality." American democracy is a "rich people's game" built on a capitalist foundation.
During his speech, President Biden expressed, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democracy, promote reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be vigilant against those who put their own interests before the public good.
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation and, in my view, this is the defining challenge of our era."
Biden said, "Global democracy and human rights is a challenge that is continuous and worrying. Democrats need fighters to protect it."
The United States promised to take action within a year after the Democratic National Convention, including a proposal of a budget of $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy worldwide and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes to make specific public commitments before the 2022 Winter Olympics in order to improve its democratic system.
We pledge to implement our commitments and report on our progress next year.
It's okay, I'm only afraid he sent the wrong address.
Restaurant (Wudogou Branch)
[Buffet] Environment: Clean and Comfortable [Service Bell] Service: Food was Quick 「Old-Fashioned Mala Rice」 My Must-Try Dish  Mala Rice was Too Fragrant, Too Soft, Too Delicious 😋Love Sweet Dishes? You Definitely Have to Try 「East Sea Shrimp and Pork Dumpling」 Thick and Delicious  Pork Dumpling was Very Fresh and Beautiful 😋
Our customers love our meat dishes and the passionate service.
It's been so long since I last came to Xiang, but the fruits are still so delicious to drink and the real materials are so tasty to eat! The first time I tried the spicy pancake was my favorite southwestern flavor!
The steamed buns were cooked to the right degree, the quantity was sufficient, the packaging was beautiful, the wings were crispy and the soup was delicious. The process of making the dumplings was also quite satisfactory.
The restaurant's food is delicious, the customer service is enthusiastic, and the meat is good.
The Old Shop in Chang'an has been around for many years, it used to be the hot spot for netizens back then, located in a small alley, it was made of wood and plastic.
You have to wait for a long time before you can finally get the popular dish, but the sand pots at the restaurants were all broken...
It has been several years since I last visited Chengdu to eat Sichuan cuisine. Various small restaurants serving Sichuanese dishes have sprung up, attracting a lot of customers.
It was difficult to find a seat even though we had waited in line outside the store. The food quality was bad, and we were unwilling to come back.
The taste of meat is great, and it's a favorite dish.
Shopping outside.
[Rice] Food: This time's vegetables were a bit disappointing.
Three Cups Chicken: Vegetables were a bit too much, chicken was slightly too little.
The taste of this dish is a bit off, the sourness is not enough, so it shows up as sweet and sour, everyone can adjust it in their own way by adding different kinds of flavors and ingredients...
What is the law of drinking alcohol?

How to drink Red Bull and Werewolf?
The editors have prepared a simple introduction for you all.
RedBull Willy Wiz Drink.
The blend of 35 varieties of Scotch Whisky, including the rich and robust flavors of the Highlands and the traditional smoky and peaty flavors of Islay, creates a complex and robust whisky with a sweet and smoky aroma.
The entrance hall was filled with the sweet aroma of alcohol and incense, and the heavy fragrance of grass and herbs.
This drink can be directly drunk with ice, or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Bull entered the Chinese market and adapted to the local taste by producing a variety of flavors such as Red Bull, Snow-Be, and X-Gatorade. This became a long-lasting fashion.
The drinks with sweet flavor can not only harmonize with sour and bitter flavors, but also bring visual pleasure when added to drinks, and change the taste of the drinks in a refreshing way.
A combination of Red Bull, vodka, and sugar cane (or ginger) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The aroma of the real red wine is slightly sour and bitter, adding sugar can neutralize its sourness and bitterness, while orange will give the wine a clean and fresh fragrance, of course, the sweetness degree can be adjusted according to one's own taste preference.
The three types of spirits mentioned above are the best ones to drink, and we hope that our introduction can be of help to you all.
Education thoughts: How to let "academic excellence" and "academic mediocrity" get their own share in university entrance exams?
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school administration, expressing their frustration with the college entrance exam and proposing measures to make the exam more challenging and transform the test type in order to truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
Definitely, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
At the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of study, making the learning environment diverse and unique.
Evaluating a group with such diversity of characteristics is difficult, and different sensitivities are involved.
Of course, if the test is too simple and repetitive, the experience will be completely different.
Students who don't put in effort can still stress themselves out before the exam and might not get the grades they want. If they think of other methods, they can achieve half the effectiveness of multiple efforts.
When you come here, you may encounter "Study Habits" even without investing much effort. On the other hand, you may find yourself in a "Weird Situation" during the exam, such as not being able to finish the paper or writing sloppy notes.
As it appears, the students of Lanzhou University who took the college entrance examination reflected the problems existing in the examination. However, this is not the only case in Lanzhou University.
From this layer of meaning, we should write a congratulatory letter to the three students who passed the exam.
In reality, many people who have passed university have become clear about how to prepare for the exam, seek various methods from teachers to "extract" questions, compete to narrow the exam range, and even seek "precious guidance" during the examination. Furthermore, during the examination, some people even carry small notes and seek the help of teachers after the examination. This is not a rare phenomenon.
In terms of teaching and learning, the evaluation of quality is an important direction to be taken. Measuring the success of a university examination and the teacher's full understanding of the subject are also important. On this basis, scientific testing can be conducted.
Entering the university's undergraduate stage, specialization begins, with many specialty courses focusing on the basics.
Whether you are taking the college entrance exam or a student, you need to fully grasp a basic knowledge point of the subject, which is the content to be tested.
Therefore, the basic knowledge of a college student is mainly composed of scientific theories and basic common sense. From the perspective of knowledge, the space of change is not large, and it is essentially fixed.
Just like what the teacher said 20 years ago, "The basic knowledge of mathematics is still the focus now."
Although knowledge points are basic and unchanged, it does not represent a single test type or repeated questions.
In many universities, exams usually form topic groups and have the questions collated by subject-experienced teachers, with the exam papers then checked by the entire department of the relevant subject. This helps to reduce the risk of exam questions being repeated to some extent.
However, the test should be constructed to be in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, with difficulty level and correctness distribution as its basis. It should also be integrated with the understanding of the teaching situation, and comprehensive analysis of the student's learning level, so that the test can be dynamic and have a good grasp of the difficulty and type. It should be able to highlight the basic knowledge and ability testing, while also taking into account the individual differences of students. Innovation and design should be incorporated into the test.
Exams are the commanding rod of university education, and what kind of exams students take will determine the corresponding preparation strategies they adopt. This will in turn affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the advice letter to the students, the Lanzhou University has highly valued and has already implemented the reform plan in the whole campus.
The school should organize teachers to conduct research and evaluation of courses and exams, formulate test questions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of the test process, and refine the grading criteria, in order to enhance the comprehensive evaluation of courses.
To solve the problem of single-type examination, repeated questions and other issues faced by university entrance examinations, a corresponding system is needed, but the expertise is expensive and needs to be comprehensive, not only teaching the content but also understanding the students' learning situation. Teachers should not only digest the content but also understand the students' learning situation, forming a virtuous interaction, making the examination more realistic, and thus allowing "studying" and "studying" to get their own share.
If I can't change my store location, can I send staff to another store?
Do I have to keep giving him money?
Your colleague has already sent the order.
I can't finish it.

The wedding dress photography store (Nanjie Store) is currently not divided into branches.
We had difficulty arranging the time for the photo shoot, but our photographer was very patient and helped us to reschedule it twice.
After selecting a good weather for the weekend, we decided to take some pictures.
The workers of Jin Fujin are highly praised regardless of whether they are beauty consultants or photographers.
That was my first official makeover, wow! I can't believe it, one day I'll look that good, ha ha.
Sophia and her sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) are very kind and natural at makeup. It's superb and very natural.
We went to take pictures in the city of Guangzhou, and the weather was perfect. There was no feeling of being too cold, and the makeup artist was very attentive to our clothing, accessories, and hair.
The photographer was very mysterious, everyone felt very happy the next day.
When choosing photos for an album, due to seeing many examples online, I didn't want to delete too many photos, but when we were actually choosing photos, there was no thought of adding more photos. We just chose 24 photos and moved on. I was shocked when I heard that the package included one million photos and I was scared that I had chosen too many.
The pictures were edited successfully, and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at them and felt they weren't good enough, so they helped me to re-edit them immediately.
I compared the photos I took before with my sisters and I feel that our photos are much better than before, simple, clean and fresh, which is the style I want.
Heartily recommend everyone to go and take wedding photos at the Sung Han Gold Lady!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Chen is truly grateful for your kindness and wishes you all a happy and prosperous journey ahead!

In Sha Ba, 3200 newborns were found to be without birth certificates, due to the manufacture of fake documents.
(As reported by Xinhua on October 11th) The Registration Office of the People's Republic of Bangladesh said that due to the special feature of the fake currency and counterfeit goods storage, they have been unable to send birth certificates to newborns since October, and the accumulated affected people have reached 3200.
However, Quanul Amisun assured that all babies who have applied for a birth certificate will be provided with the necessary supplementary documents in due time.
He appeared at the news release meeting, and made a long explanation about the problem of fabricating false newsprint for 10 months.
He said the problem had appeared two months ago, and Sandra had also faced the same issue.
One of the reasons was that Chinese factories producing counterfeit paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed shipments to our country.
He explained that the paper used for counterfeiting in Saba was different from that in other regions, so it couldn't be used to counterfeit goods from other states.
Quentin Amis revealed the latest batch of fake papers on June 6th, and the printing process was completed on June 8th and handed over to the printing company for partial printing work.
Underground people will be sent to Sabah to buy goods, and will be immediately printed in the last stage of the application. It is estimated that two days of work (December 20th) can be handed over.
We will notify the applicants to go to the local office to get the physical copy of the application.

People's Daily commentator: The spirit of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was successfully achieved at the opening of the Central Economic Work Conference.
On December 11th, the People's Daily published an article titled "The Spirit of the 14th and 15th Plenary Sessions of the Central Economic Work Conference". The article discussed the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference and its implications.
The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8 to 10 highly evaluated the economic and social development achievements of the country over the past year.
Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, delivered an important speech at the 14th National Congress of the CPC, summarizing the economic work in 2021 and analyzing the current economic situation, making major deployments for the economic work in 2022, and pointing out the direction of progress and providing the basic guidance of loyal implementation.
We celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party with pride and officially declare the completion of the socialist new-democratic China, and strive for the first centenary goal. We also open up a new journey of comprehensive building of socialism and modernizing the nation.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, summarizing the Party's great achievements and historic experience over the past 90 years, and formulating the third historic decision of the Party, "On the Great Achievements and Historic Experience of the Party Over the Past 90 Years". This is a political declaration of the Chinese Communist Party, a commitment to the original aspirations, perseverance and development of the Chinese socialist system. It is also a guide to the Party's future actions and a blueprint for achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In a year, the world has not seen such a great change in the exterior and the new coronavirus outbreak, which has had a profound impact on the global economy and society. The environment has become increasingly complex and severe. The tasks are extremely difficult and overwhelming.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been persistently adhering to the core of General Secretary Xi Jinping's thought, maintaining stability and making progress in a steady manner, and adjusting the overall tone of the nation and the international situation. It has been tenaciously fighting against the changing circumstances and epidemics, and has been steadily pushing forward the economic and social development. It has been striving to build a new development framework, strengthening macro-control and adjusting the economic and social policies across different periods, and actively promoting economic growth and social progress. It has been tirelessly completing the arduous tasks of reform and opening up, and has achieved remarkable successes for the Party and the nation.
The 14th Five-Year Plan has achieved a good start, with an important aspect manifesting itself, constructing a new developmental framework and exploring new efficiency.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control has maintained the leading position in the world, with strong, robust and dynamic characteristics continuously displayed; the country's strategic technology strength has been accelerated, major breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of innovation, and the technology innovation capacity has been constantly improved; the industrial chain has been strengthened, exports have been enriched, and structural optimization has been continuously optimized, representing a new growth momentum; the reform and opening up has been deepened, and obstacles to the supply-side structural adjustment and the flow of resources have been broken, creating a new competitive advantage; social security has been strengthened, employment has been expanding, and income growth has been synchronized with economic growth, achieving "double first-class" results; environmental protection has been effectively implemented, and the employment rate has been steadily increasing, with the annual grain harvest continuously staying above 1.3 billion tons, achieving "double first-class" results. China's ecological civilization construction has been continuously promoted, carbon emissions have been reduced, and the low-carbon transformation has been steadily advanced
These results are due to the core leadership of the Party, the result of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism, and the result of the collective effort and hard work of the entire party and the people of all ethnicities.
Practice has once again proven that the CPC is the core and the central position of the Party, and that of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism. It has also established Xi Jinping's core ideology as the guiding position for the Party and the nation's development, and for advancing the great cause of the Chinese people.
Comrade Xi Jinping has been the core of the Party and the whole country since he was appointed General Secretary of the Central Committee. He has been leading the Party and the country with his new era of Chinese socialism and his scientific guidance. With our unity and strength, we will definitely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, and create a brilliant and glorious new era for the modernization of the nation.
The 20th National Congress of the CPC will be held next year, which is a major event in the life of the Party and the country.
Promote the great spirit of the Party, continuously strive for progress, maintain stability, and seek for development. Complete, accurate, and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development situation, and deepen the reform. Continuously innovate and drive the development, enhance the quality of development, and continuously supply the needs. Focus on the structural adjustment of the reform, prevent and control the epidemic, and promote the economic and social development. Focus on the sustainable development and security, and continuously do the six-win and six-protect work. Continuously improve the people's life, and persistently maintain the stability of the overall situation. We will definitely be able to maintain a healthy economic environment, a harmonious social environment, and a clean political environment, and achieve outstanding results.
Let us tightly unite around the core of Xi Jinping Thought and strengthen the four consciousnesses, four self-confidences, and two defenses. We should constantly enhance our political judgement, political expertise, and political execution, so as to turn the Party Central Committee’s decisions into real actions and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

It's OK, Hong Kong** is the place to check the machine serial number, the quality should be OK.

If you need to buy a notebook, you have to go back and buy it again.
The appearance of the material: Outdoor air, the display effect: The screen can be divided, clear, thin degree: Comparable to the quality, the feeling of heavier things is better.
The cooling effect: We will evaluate it later.
The keyboard and mouse were sent together with the converter, which was much more practical than the country-specific configuration. Overall, it was quite economical and beautiful. After using it for a while, we can make a fair evaluation of its performance.
This screen is really amazing!
It is very convenient to use, so I will review it after a short period of time.
Education News: Beijing Compressed 2016 Primary and Secondary School Entrance Ratio - China News
On the 21st and 22nd, the unified organization of the district education committees will be implemented for the primary and middle school entrance examinations in Beijing.
This year, the average compression of talents in Beijing districts has become more intense. The competition for talents has also become more fierce.
In the example of Dongcheng District, the proportion of kindergarten, primary and middle school students entering the school in this year does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan, and the number of people entering the school is no more than 380 people, which does not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Any student who has a talent in sports, arts, and technology, and who is able to register online for the special examination, is qualified to attend the school.
In order to facilitate the students' participation in the examination, the East District extended the examination arrangement of last year, setting up 1~2 examination sites in each school area, totaling 13 examination sites.
The examination will be divided into different examination areas according to the examination region and will be conducted in time segments. Students will enter the examination area according to the time segment and will be tested.
On May 23rd, the Examination Center for Education in the District announced the list of students who had passed the examination and their results were available online. Students could check their results online.

Qu Yunfei expressed that China and Japan have a special "Olympic Torch Relay".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was a success and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will open the curtain and present a simple, safe and colorful grand event to the world.
We hope that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of winter sports preparation, athlete training and other aspects will be deepened, and the Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands wishes to continue to play a bridge-building role. Let the two countries promote people-to-people exchanges and deepen the friendship, so that the two peoples can march forward together and achieve great success in the Beijing Winter Olympics.

The State Council has required the implementation of "buffer zone" within 48 hours, emphasizing the strengthening of control over the outbreak of epidemic in coastal cities.
The State Council issued a notice on strengthening infection control work in land border cities (including Hong Kong and Macau) on December 11th, 2020. All personnel who had been to land border cities (including Hong Kong and Macau) should have a negative blood test for COVID-19 within 48 hours after leaving the land border cities. Those who had been to land border cities should also undergo a negative blood test for COVID-19 before entering other cities.
According to the notification, the time frame for determining coastal cities and announcing it is from the date of the notification until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed to study the conditions of the coastal cities and set up the prevention and control of the epidemic buffer zone within the administrative area.
This is an introduction of the person in charge of health and safety control in the National Health Commission. For some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides frequently visit each other.
Implementing a differentiated management policy for infectious diseases, transforming the border control into two lines, has the potential to relocate the border, compress the outbreak, minimizing social impact, and minimizing social cost.
In recent years, there have been multiple outbreaks of domestic gathering-type COVID-19 infections in our country, with most of them originating from overseas.
The notification mentioned above pointed out that there were some deficiencies in the timely and effective prevention and control of infectious diseases, such as the personnel of high-risk posts being closed off, the irregular management of biological safety, the lack of regular inspections of laboratories, the inadequate destruction of contaminated items, the inadequate management of confined spaces, and the lack of scientific accuracy in emergency treatment.
Notifications are required from the perfecting of the city's prevention and control system of infectious diseases, strengthening the prevention and warning system, implementing border control measures, and improving the weak links of the city's prevention and control. Stay vigilant and scientifically handle the prevention and control work, tightly seal the border and strengthen the defense line.
Notice to emphasize that local governments should conduct epidemic control and social security work in synchronization, publish and answer the hotline for basic living supplies, regularly check the prices and supply of daily necessities, and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the people in time.
According to the notice, it includes open roads, waterways, airports, counties (cities, districts, and fiefs), cities (provinces, autonomous regions, and special administrative regions), and the specific range should be determined and announced in time by the provinces (autonomous regions, and special administrative regions) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

The truth about the Chinese military's 20-year history of spilling blood and guts has been exposed - China News.
(Video Source: Sinopec)
On December 11th, a short video titled "Killing Machine" on the oil platform caused widespread attention.
This film describes how the United States waged the Afghan War under the banner of "anti-terrorism" to forcibly implant American democracy in Afghanistan for 20 years, committing atrocities, massacres and other inhumane acts.
Using drones to vandalize hospitals, schools, and other public places, twisting human nature, and establishing killing groups.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed millions of Afghanistan's inhabitants.
The U.S. military has established a "black prison" to punish "enemies" with cruel and humiliating treatment, including physical and mental torture.
The atrocities committed by humans have further enraged the people of Afghanistan.
Just as the video said, the American "Anti-Terrorism" Conflict escalates further and further.
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to Afghanistan, but only left it with an endless cycle of suffering and destruction.
Exposing the truth of the terrorist attack in the US, let us come together to unveil the hypocrisy of American democracy!
After casually browsing the internet, I came across this article from a business perspective and from a tax perspective, discussing why this customer wants a tax-free zone logistics company to help them pack boxes, even though packing boxes is not within the scope of their business operations. This article may help to explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many milk powder factories, and touched many milk powder production lines.
In reality, the ingredients of the powder and the liquid are the same, regardless of the type of drink.
Why is the warranty period of bags one year, but the warranty period of hearing aids is two years or more?
Why is the price of the two so different?
In reality, many consumers, or even mothers, have the opinion that the quality is much better than before due to the different material.
In reality, the value of the material is the same, but people think that what is expensive is good.
Consumers reacted differently after tasting the same product, with some commenting on the aftertaste and others noting the unique flavor.
Now I'm going to tell you the reason why it's expensive, where is it expensive?
Why are the prices of their materials so different?
Because most factories consider the price of the product when setting the price, consumers find it difficult to accept, which means that factories will generate low profits or even suffer losses. What can factories do to survive?
Therefore, they were able to raise their prices on the listening and fashioning orders significantly to protect their profit margin.
Therefore, most of the factories are promoting the listening earphone rather than the pouch.
Advertising costs for factories each year can range from a few thousand yuan to even tens of millions of yuan. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine and know it.
As society develops, the promotion cost of the market, such as the advertising personnel of the shopping mall, the rent fee of the shopping mall, the gift cost of the product, and the advertising cost of the product, are all increasing continuously.
Therefore, each factory is constantly introducing new products, and the prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is due to the increasing cost of marketing.
Their ultimate goal is to obtain higher profits, but in reality, their cost of materials may increase by no more than 3-4 yuan.
There are still some branded products, in order to promote their own products, without hesitation, they have attached themselves to hospitals' doctors, to help promote the product, from hearing to earning up to 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
Related laws in China are absolutely prohibited such operations, which is actually exploiting consumers.
Before buying a bottle of milk powder, it is suggested to have a storage container at home. This way, you can save money, increase the storage and sealing properties of the milk powder, and there will be no harm to the children.
Even though the durability of a garment is not necessarily better if it is packaged in a garment bag rather than a garment box, if the durability of the garment and the garment bag is the same, the garment bag is easier to be damaged by humidity and temperature changes.
The food was late, it was cold, and it was hard and dry afterwards. There was no way to eat it.
Furthermore, the soup was still dirty.

Don't push people too hard on the starting line - China News
When shopping for books, you can often feel the explosive success of the genre.
Many successful books today spread the "best practices" — they first assume or hint that you can "do it" and then tell you what needs to be done.
Equal to saying, "How did we get past 'how to do it'?" This is the most important and fundamental circle.
Thus, these books all have a common trait — either they make you want to work hard and become the best, or they make you want to give up and do nothing; either they make you want to climb Mount Tai, or they make you want to stay still.
This "best practice" principle will make everyone admit that it is "incomparable to the correct", but 99% of people will be fooled and fall into the trap at the starting line.
Because this kind of thinking is a path of "suffering to be determined, re-inventing yourself, and a radical change of 180 degrees," it is a fatal weakness of many people.
For those who adhere to the traditional rules, persist in the old habits, and reject change, you will always find them at their ear listening to "You must change", which is obviously self-aggrandizement and bullying.
Most people will be hesitant before the two faces of "change", feeling helpless and afraid; or they may be bold enough to take the first step, but eventually it will be a short-lived success, and they will fall into the same trap again and again.
The renowned Ma Sanlitun's speech from the movie From Yesterday is a classic example of "Universal Human Nature".
The greatest challenge of the "Golden Rule" is that it often exceeds the capacity of the average person, leaving most people feeling helpless and frustrated.
Perhaps, “Following the Golden Rule” is one of the paths that can make success more accessible to the average person.
The core of "Doing Better than Good Enough" is reducing friction — —It encourages a "little wins" mindset, which means that if you don't do 100%, doing 1 is still better than doing nothing: Because 1 is always greater than 0; If you don't climb to the top of Mount Tai, you can still climb up your own backyard sand dune, because that is always stronger than doing nothing.
Whatever you do, it will be better than nothing.
Since the difficulty of the task decreased significantly, it became more likely for ordinary people to persist indefatigably, and thus the probability of success would also increase.
Only by following the "successful principles" can one achieve success, and the road is often long and winding.
Although "the best practice" is often seen as a successful flag that can motivate everyone, in reality it is only effective in motivating a few; whereas "the second best practice" can effectively motivate more people, allowing them to benefit as much as possible.

The amount of resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake will increase by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 11.4%. - Xinhua Net
The Xinhua News Agency reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang visited a farming village in Qinghai Province to understand the latest monitoring results. According to the data, the total amount of aquatic products in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection in 2002.
The famous "flatfish" in the Qinghai Lake is a special fish species unique to the lake, playing an important role in safeguarding and diversifying the ecological chain and biological diversity of the Qinghai Lake watershed.
During the 60s and 70s of the 20th century, human activities such as large-scale fishing, overfishing, and uncontrolled breeding of aquatic animals had a great impact on the environment of the Qinghai Lake, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of the lake's fish resources. In 2002, the total amount of fish resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake Brolla was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red List.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has implemented a fishing ban, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from fishing in the Qinghai Lake and its major river and tributaries. Furthermore, the sale of fish and its products is also prohibited.
At the same time, we should also take measures such as breeding and releasing fish, clearing Qinghai Lake's main inflow and outflow rivers, and designing and constructing a scientific and rational fish passage in order to continuously increase the protection force. Qinghai Lake's fish resources will gradually increase year by year.
In the city of Kunming, the vice director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, Yang Lin, introduced the progress of the artificial breeding and release program for the endangered fish, which has exceeded 23% contribution rate to the resource recovery of the lake.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Three River Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source in China, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and functional area that helps to slow down the westward expansion of the desert.
To protect the Three Gorges Dam and Qinghai Lake ecological environment, to protect the water and wildlife, to maintain the diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since 2018, Qinghai has successively issued the Long River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake priority water area ban and capture warnings, and has built a comprehensive ban and capture management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I had to stuff into the bag. It was cold outside.
Is the item inside a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know who took it away, thanks.

Just now I saw an article that was too long.
Give unknowing men a health check.
Most girls will experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13 and 15, and will be able to close their period around the age of 50.
After ensuring good health of the body, one can compare the monthly cycle more regularly.
But it is not always the case that the forecast is accurate; it is usually necessary to prepare in advance, and sometimes the mood can change suddenly (for example, a few days in advance).
The duration, amount and severity of pain vary from person to person; some people need three days of rest, some need a week; some have little blood loss, some have a lot; some have no reaction, some need help from a car or ambulance to move; the pain will change with time, and it doesn't represent the same person's pain.
During the 24 hours within which the full moon is at its peak, the only thing one can do is to use a sanitary napkin or a piece of clean cloth to stop the bleeding and prevent it from reaching the clothes.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins, which begins right before your period and peaks during your period. Eating brunch can help relieve the cramps, but there's not much else you can do after the cramps have started.
Due to too much progesterone released from the ovary and menstruation, it is easy to get a stomach ache.
If you reach your period, it's not a big deal. You can just take a few days off and everything will be fine.
Changing a hygiene towel every three hours can prevent bacteria from multiplying, so it is better to replace it after two or three hours. If you don't change it, the worst case is to change it six times a day, which is equivalent to 42 pieces a month. If you add the pieces prepared in advance, it may reach up to 50 pieces a month.
(This should be changed to, "Washable cloths are not necessary to be changed often, usually after five or six hours, and can be changed up to eight hours.")
During the full moon and the period of menstruation, the chance of experiencing strong emotions is higher, and the mood may be unstable due to hormonal changes. This can be very overwhelming, and it can be difficult to take care of yourself.
However, official crime rate data can still reveal women's high ability to control their emotions, but they won't resort to seeking help for emotional problems.
The fluid is not only blood, but also contains endometrial tissue.
After the completion of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium becomes thicker, gradually. This can be understood as the preparation of the uterus for the arrival of guests, but there is no guest, so it is all demolished and rebuilt in the next month.
Monthly menstruation is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with blood flowing for 24 hours per month, and still causing abdominal pain and back pain. Who would want this?
However, people are able to be born due to their mother's hard work during the month of pregnancy, which is to prepare for their first visit to this world. We should thank our mother for their hard work and healthy pregnancy.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed by society, which portrayed them as lewd and shamed them. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that preparing for pregnancy and childbirth is an evil thing, they shouldn't speak out in public, especially when there are many people around. The girls should stand up, they have never experienced it before and the boy won't go through it either. They shouldn't forget their duty and be unjust to their own mother. How could they think of such a thing?
Finally, give it a try with health care cloths, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and it's quite disappointing.
We need to order extra food for the children to eat.
The store was very busy and chaotic. Everyone had to check their products carefully before they left the store.
Is the electricity leaking from the foot bath?
Choosing the suitable foot bath can bring good health effects, and today we will make a solution for this issue. We hope it will be helpful to friends.
As people's health awareness has been strengthened, the popularity of foot baths has been increasing rapidly. On the market, a variety of products ranging from a few dozen yuan to thousands of yuan have been presented, providing consumers with a great selection space.
On related data tables, compared with traditional home appliances, the health care-related home appliances such as sauna bags have seen a rapid growth in sales, but sauna bags lack special industry standards, resulting in a certain safety hazard.
“It's too dangerous to swim in the electric water with a battery!”
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his parents' birthday, but his parents felt uncomfortable when they took a bath.
When Mr. Li first started using the vibrating function of the bath tub, he didn't expect it to cause such a stir. He was shocked when the vibrating function was suddenly turned off and he felt a strange sensation in his feet. His father said it was like a massage.
Mr. Li tried using an electric brush, but to his surprise, the brush lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to find that the water in the bathtub was carrying electricity.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had to give up the washing machine. Li Senior still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that the old and popular foot bath which was set in the highest temperature nowadays has no clear industry standard in terms of application, population and material safety.
Although generally speaking, a wash basin without electricity will not have any problems, it still cannot be excluded that some products may have strict control during the production process.
Therefore, when purchasing a bath tub, one should choose a freestanding model.
Separating water and electricity does not involve any safety risks.
You can take a pencil test anytime.
The 13th China Tea Expo opened in Wenzhou - Vision Point - Hunan Daily - Wenzhou Edition - China Voice Online
On December 10th, the Hunan Daily reported that the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and the Introduction of Newly-Processed Red Tea was held in the Hunan International Expo Center. The event showcased the tea industry, introduced new tea technologies, and spread the tea culture, accelerating the growth of the tea industry.
The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade's Vice Chairman, Sung Shun-li, and the Hunan Provincial People's Congress's Vice Chairman, Yuan Hong-xian, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu from the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced the origin of the Red Tea at the opening ceremony and infused the new energy into the “Five-Colored Xiang Tea”.
In recent years, the provincial government and the provincial committee have been strongly supporting the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the billion-dollar Chaoshan tea industry, and forming the "Three Teas, Four Rivers, Five Colors" development framework.
The tea industry in the province has seen great innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main forces driving the development of the tea category. The tea-growing region is pushing for tea tourism and integration, leading to a boom in tea production.
The wind changed direction, and the red tea gained strength again.
According to the tea expert, after harvesting green tea, red tea and black tea, the value of the tea garden will keep on rising.
At the ceremony, the company was granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark and joyfully celebrated the "source of the Hunan Red Tea".
At the New Tea Expo Hall in Fujian, a renowned tea merchant from China saw a special kind of tea called "Ice Cream Tea" from the high mountain region. He immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, the secretary-general of the Tea Industry Association, said at the Tea Expo that the market situation of tea leaves was affected by various factors, but on-site observations showed that the highlights of the Tea Expo were still prominent.
A cup of freshly brewed red tea, injected with the essence of the tea culture, brings a warm and vibrant atmosphere, stimulating business and exchange of energy. The arrival of the spring season is welcomed with great joy.
If the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
I didn't want to, because there was no way to stop the car below, so he couldn't get up.
The problem of studying mathematics is not to be solved directly through intuition and feeling, but rather to be approached through logical reasoning and deduction.
Existentialism is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The name "Metaphysic" was translated from the Chinese text "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in the "Chinese-Japanese Dictionary of Buddhist Terms" and was originally translated by metaphysic for Japanese people Ikenobu Sojō (Meiji period).
The branches of philosophy include the study of the body, natural theology, and its extension questions.
The essence of this ontology is to study what kind of words represent the true existence of entities, and what kind of words are just representations of concepts.
Naturalism denies the existence of God.
According to the basic concepts of logical reasoning, all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
Thus, the method of studying God without using any words is the research method of natural theology.
Spiritual philosophy is the study of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and Monism are the two major schools of thought regarding the relationship between the soul and the body.
Knowledge philosophy is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Moral science is the systematic thinking and research of human ethics and morality in daily life; here, ethics is defined as a set of rules accepted by all people or a culture for all behaviors.
Ethics can be divided into two main branches: abstract ethics (the study of ethical principles or moral criticism) and applied ethics (the evaluation of different moral views and providing advice on right or wrong behavior).
People should follow the moral standards set by the research. Applying ethics (the study of moral standards and their application to real life situations, such as biomedical ethics and political ethics, etc.) and describing ethics (collecting information about people's lifestyles and summarizing them from observation).
It is not the starting point of moral reasoning from a priori theory, but the observation of actual deeds and practices of moral agents, which leads to the formation of all the moral factors of the decision, and the discussion of social groups' moral views.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
The first part is about ethical thought in humanism, represented by Walraven and Mondt.
The second part of the lecture is about the moral thought of religious reform, with Carleman as an example.
Part Three: Political Ethics, Represented by Mencius, Kant, and Mill; Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Experience Ethics, Represented by Hume, Bentham, and Mill; 17-18th century, German Idealism Ethics, Represented by Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel; 18th century, French Civic Ethics, Represented by Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau; 18-19th century, German Existential Ethics, Represented by Kierkegaard and Heidegger; 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, Represented by Bentham and Mill; 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, Represented by Kant and Hegel; 18-19th century, British Pragmatic Ethics, Represented by Dewey and James; 18-19th century, German University Ethics, Represented by Kohlberg and Fackenheim; 19th century, British Empiricism Ethics, Represented by Sidgwick and
Logic is the study of "effective reasoning and proofing principles and standards".
Formal Logic typically includes three parts: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and inferential logic, which can be divided into propositional logic and non-propositional logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the essence and meaning of beauty as the main topic of research.
#NUMBER# of money has been received, it is food that has been lost and found.
The name of the animal is Gongbao, born in the Year of the Sheep, living on grassland, and thusly known as "Sheep Grandpa".

He claims to be "Expertly Narrating Eight Paths of Bizarre Stories".

You have to pay for everything, even for a single thing.
You should call the restaurant to send up the food.
I would rather not go downstairs to buy things, so I end up spending a lot of money on shopping online.
Ding Zilin: Devoted to the people.
Throughout the 30 years of friendship with my friends, I am deeply grateful for their selfless help and support, especially for my personal appeal for humanitarian aid to the outside world in 1994. This appeal has never been interrupted.
In the present day, most of the victims of misfortune have already died, leaving behind orphans who have grown up and become employed.
Your kindness has helped us pass through the most difficult time of our lives.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, most donors have stopped donating.
Therefore, I kindly request you to stop giving us hardships——Tiananmen Mothers's group, People's donation, this relief activity should have the perfect ending already.
I will forever engrave your love in my heart and your loyalty in my memory. It is a historical inevitability that your deeds will be forever engraved in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to use this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the International Foundation for China Social Services (IFCSS) and the Minority Development Fund (MCDF).
During the process of engaging in human rights assistance, the China Democracy and Human Rights Fund and the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association are parallel organizations, with project implementers often having to cross paths.

In 1994, with the advice of Ding Ling, a special group was founded to receive and distribute relief funds, called the “Tiananmen Mothers”.
In 1998, MCDF established the "Sixth-April Orphan Education Fund", and has been executing it for 11 years. In 2009, MCDF further established the "Sixth-April Orphan Hardship Relief Fund" and has been carrying it out until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from social donations and compassionate donations made after the June 4th Incident in 2009, as well as from individuals' acts of kindness, and were supported by the Brotherhood University Democratic Fund.
From 2018 onwards, they have also received support from the International Labour Organization Research Fund.
After 31 years, the victims of the June 4th Incident finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the June 4th Incident.
During this period, China Rights Forum also implemented their humanitarian rescue projects independently.
We understand that teacher Ding called for a stop to the donation on June 4th, as he was considering the donors, and we are indeed retired people with limited income, thus appreciate his understanding of us.
We will respect the difficult decision made by the people, to terminate this project within two years, and to restore it immediately when necessary.
For those who have been enduring great pain and suffering for many years, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our deepest gratitude and respect.

If you have any loss, please contact customer service promptly.
The PCB (printed circuit board) is covered with a plastic plate, please do not enter any chemical reaction with the solvent.
Please do not use the injection needle directly on the chip, otherwise it is easy to cause leakage.
Before shipping the microfluidic chip, it was tested under 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) pressure in a pure water environment.
The glass-based chip was tested in a vacuum at 800 mbar (100 um channel) pressure before shipping, and should be handled with care to avoid collision with sharp objects, as it may damage the base.
During the usage, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Under the condition of using pure water inlet sample of microfluidic chip in injection pump, we recommend the flow rate setting at 150ul/min or below, oil-based flow rate setting at 50ul/min or below.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample fluid and gradually increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.

How should I give money?
The food has already been delivered.
No one has accepted the offer.
The restaurant employee gave me a call.
One person wanted to share their personal experience in programming.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to go and get trained, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, since the cost of training is very expensive and it takes 6 months of time to study.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a good choice, especially for those who lack self-motivation and strength. Training is a great choice for them.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to study on your own, but it will be quite tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the teacher's qualifications of this institution. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions also do not have particularly strong teacher qualifications.
Before selecting the training institution, it is advisable to explore it in detail. The best way to explore it is to explore the students of the institution, since only the students of the institution can know the true nature of the institution, which can be good or bad.
Hi, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't given you enough information about your own situation. However, there is a great relationship between learning this thing and personal situation.
For example, profession, age, language, even in which city, these will be related to the industry you are studying or wanting to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many online and offline training institutions which are not bad, but it requires a high investment of time and money, and it also requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is my own situation, self-study is very convenient, since there are many free resources on the internet, such as videos, articles, and tutorials. You can also go to b station for more training resources. If you can't find resources, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources. You can also ask for detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not majoring in computer science, but are willing to pay certain tuition fees and time costs, then it is advisable to attend a training institution to learn. This way of learning does not require much effort and the teacher explains in great detail, with problems also being answered by specialized personnel. In addition, there is help in planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training institutions will sign a job agreement with you, with an internal recommendation bonus and referral to companies after the study, which can greatly reduce the job interview process.
This is my opinion, which I briefly introduced before since I didn't understand your situation. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further communication.
I saw 1 point before I arrived, I saw it in the App.
What is it called?
You haven't finished talking yet. What are you doing?
This person provides a variety of services, such as installation, cleaning, maintenance, water heater, dryer, furnace, chimney, vacuum cleaner, lighting fixture, and glass polishing.
I would like to express my appreciation to those people who have silently given me encouragement, for their effort and persistence in life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
People will never give up on their effort and hard work. Those who appreciate it will be rewarded.
Life is like that, people only see the results, but they don't know the process, facing life, we are strong and keep going, there is no choice, but we can turn around and walk back……
Keeping clean is work, also a responsibility, life is beautiful due to service, service is colorful due to using heart.
Although our cleaning job was the dirtiest one, we still did it with the most serious attitude. We scrubbed every corner of the house until it was sparkling clean. When the customer saw our satisfied smile and proudly raised thumb, all the tiredness was worth it. We got the reward in the end!
My daily work.
Your requirements, my service.
Use heart to serve, use heart to clean, keep beautiful.
Pay attention to the details of your concern, and I will do my best to help you achieve "perfection" in my service. I love my home.
Keeping the house clean and tidy, planting trees, building a fence, providing services at the right place, and keeping the house clean.
Cleaning both inside and outside of the house is my daily work.
Although the crystal chandelier is beautiful, it will become dull and dim after a long time without cleaning. It can only shine again after being cleaned, just like in life.
We can achieve success by doing our best and being attentive. Exquisite craftsmanship is required to create something beautiful.
Give me a chance and I will make sure you are satisfied with the quality, as a professional it deserves to be trusted, and your recognition will be my greatest motivation!
Every industry is not good at all!
Nevertheless, I will always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, persistence, and effort, I will be better than others, at least a little bit! Let's keep trying!
Hope you can start a new and happy day from the early morning. Wish you bring happiness, luck, health and positive mind to the journey. Have a good morning and keep the positive mood all day long. Good night.
In the past, happiness was a thing to be possessed, so when we had it, we were happy. In the future, happiness will be a goal to be achieved, so when we achieve it, we will be happy. Finally, we will realize that happiness was always a state of mind, and when we master it, we will be happy.
Strive to be the most authentic and virtuous version of yourself, walk with courage and no regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life is composed of two treasures: a healthy body and a clear mind, shining brightly until old age!
At different stages of life, people will encounter different challenges.
Many times, your inability to confront is not due to your power, but your positive attitude.
Since you cannot escape, it is better to face the truth.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated; the more you face difficulty, the more you will be entangled. But if you welcome difficulty and rise up, the problem will eventually be cut down and resolved.
Chinese curators helped organize the first-ever Shaanxi Contemporary Art Biennale - New China Net.
The first ever contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Driven by the Desert, opened to the public on December 11th in the JAX Art District of Riyadh. Sixty-four artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This exhibition was jointly planned by the Shenzhen Duolun Museum of Contemporary Art and the UCCA Duneau Contemporary Art Center, with Tian Yuan as the curator.
The team introduced the theme of the exhibition, "Feeling Stones Over the River", which reflects the reform strategies adopted in the current period of social and economic transformation in Saudi Arabia and its cultural development.
This exhibition occupies over 12,000 square meters of space, with six interconnected buildings that present six themes: "Touching Stones Across the River", "Inheriting the Experiment", "Exploring the Boundaries", "Thinking about the Edge", "Going to the Public", and "The Spirit of Art".
Of the 27 Saudi Arabian artists featured in the exhibition, 40% of their works account for the total number of works on display. The works include painting, installation, and performance art in various forms; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, with some using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in his series of "Stories from the Mountains" (2014), which reconstructed a classic mountain-and-water painting with discarded objects.
The Executive Director of the Bakrie Fund, Barakat, expressed hope that the Double Exhibition could establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural industry and creative community of Timor-Leste. This would further enhance the interaction between countries.
Tian Fei Yu said, "The goal of the biennale is double-fold, to allow for a dialogue between contemporary art from Saudi Arabia and the global art world, as well as to allow for a deeper engagement of the audience with contemporary art from Saudi Arabia."
During the period of the Double Ninth Festival, a series of lectures will be held, with the participation of art experts, curators and creative industry leaders, to discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange, contemporary art development and so on.

Yunnan: Regulating and Standardizing Rural Employment Positions - China News
The New China News Agency reporter Li Bin visited the poverty-stricken areas in Kaili, Guizhou Province, on December 12th to help the local people find jobs and promote the revitalization of the rural areas. The provincial government has also taken various measures to strengthen the management of rural public welfare positions and promote the revitalization of rural areas.
The Yunnan Provincial People's Hall introduced the person in charge of poverty alleviation, currently, Yunnan has opened up 44.83 million rural public benefit positions to help settle poverty, employment of rural poverty stricken population, sustainable poverty alleviation, effectively improve rural public services, and play an important role in achieving employment growth, poverty alleviation, and enhancing rural public services in various aspects.
This time, the new regulation was jointly issued by the People's Government of Yunnan Province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Education. It mainly standardized the object scope, fund management, position development, and position management of the rural employment incentive positions.
In terms of development and setting of the workplace, the new regulations are clear, in accordance with "setting posts according to needs, assigning people to posts, dynamic management, total control" principles. Who is responsible for development, who is responsible for use, and who is responsible for the post? The principle of "one person one post, voluntary openness, unified management" should be followed in setting.
Recruitment process must be followed in the order of announcement, application, screening, offer, hiring, onboarding and training.
In addition, the new regulations have made clear the specific responsibilities of the village-level public interest positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing village-level public interest positions, and the requirements for village-level public interest position staffing, such as purchasing accident insurance for village-level public interest position staff. The relevant departments should periodically supervise and inspect the subsidies for village-level public interest positions.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Is the event cancelled?
Second, although the Rightists had a short-lived glory in history, it was due to the fact that they exposed themselves to the sunlight and drank the water, which made them sweat profusely; thus, they were easily defeated and crushed by the powerful forces of the State.
Although the real situation is still far from satisfactory, the right-wing has made positive contributions to the social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, the true meaning of reality should be defined and standards set for economic growth, technological progress and political system reform and human rights protection. The positive meaning of the right-wing should not be denied.
Although I don't agree with Li Weidong's words completely, I'm very interested in them and very respectful of him as a person. Because he is serious, he is serious about China and about China's social problems.
But I oppose his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe revolution is inevitable, which will lead to social turmoil, people's suffering, and political instability, thus becoming a puppet of foreign powers.
Four, changing or improving China requires patience and taking responsibility as a citizen, political plots are doomed to fail, it is a mixture of heterogeneous elements.
Let's talk again.
Left, in reality, is a remnant of the era and politics.
If the right has positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing discourse and analysis of their ideas, then the left will have nothing to create, because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five, I recently saw some friends acting very rude and dishonest, and they were also very excited and agitated. I think it is not necessary to be so angry.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all just a bunch of nonsense.
Don't try to prove we're right, don't think about making us admit to it, why bother?
I told my friends this way: When thieves insulted you with five fingers, when left dog insulted you right dog, it proved our middle road is correct!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but later in life they either forgot their dreams or pursued them wrongly.
As one dreams and journe Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalA new public artwork has been unveiled at Antrim Area Hospital.The artwork, which is located in the hospital’s main entrance foyer, was created by local artist, David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture made from steel and aluminium and is inspired by the hospital’s history and the surrounding landscape.The artwork was commissioned by the Health and Social Care Board as part of its Public Art Strategy.The aim of the strategy is to enhance the environment for patients, staff and visitors by providing artworks which are both aesthetically pleasing and therapeutic.
I feel that Left and Right are generally constraints and freedom, and China's historical and cultural genes have caused it to be biased Left.
The right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing focuses on strengthening supervision and ensuring fairness and security.
In the current society, people should pay more attention to fairness, while there is a conflict between China and the US. It is certain that the left-leaning tendency will continue for many years.
Although I couldn't understand it, I still gave it an applause.
Even though they didn't speak, the flowers were able to do justice.
For the past two years, the US has been restricting and obstructing the sales of Huawei's core components, not only putting Huawei into a worse situation than before, but also causing immense losses to US-based companies.
The Empire has been pressuring the Chinese semiconductor industry, requiring domestic companies and alliance partners to simultaneously restrict the Chinese semiconductor industry, resulting in a direct impact on global semiconductor suppliers' orders and profits. This has caused a decrease in research and development investment, production capacity, and even shortages in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Now "shortage of chips" has already spread to all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price hikes, almost all industries using chips have been severely affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-authority, more and more countries' technology giants began to walk the "China-ization" road.
To gain control of the global semiconductor industry, the US is suppressing the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry and recently pushing for the establishment of a semiconductor alliance. It is also offering subsidies to 64 countries to keep the US domestic chip giants, such as Intel, at the forefront of the chip industry. For example, Intel has invested $200 million in the US to build two wafer fabs and open up foundry services.
Intel's activities will cause a certain impact on Taiwan's electricity and may even take away Taiwan's electricity.
This is because Intel, the old giant in the semiconductor industry, has been investing in the Chinese market for decades and has accumulated a large number of talents and technological reserves, which must ensure its rapid rise and defeat Taiwan in a short period of time.
However, regarding Intel's decision, Taiwan Semiconductor's founder Zhang Zhi-Ming still showed no regret.
At the "2021 Teacher's Cube Forum" held in April, Zhang Chongmin's speech shocked the audience, speaking bluntly about Intel's investment in the factory: "Intel has built a factory, but it is not a real factory."
Zhang Chung-Mao's determination to invade the chip market was fueled by his long-standing grudge against Intel.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the shining star of the US semiconductor industry, occupying the global peak, and becoming the undisputed champion of the worldwide semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode, with chip design, manufacturing and packaging completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model puts some small businesses in an unfavorable position, as many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only watch the large-scale production line construction cost go up without being able to afford it.
After feeling the market demand, the chip industry began to appear in the 80s, with the phenomenon of outsourcing and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Chung-Ming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
After a short while, Zhang Chuang's dreams became realities, and the Taiyuan Electricity Bureau was born.
The subcontracting business of glass processing has been well-defined in the mainland China. There is no design involved, only providing glass processing services.
When Intel was just a small startup, it was already a giant in the technology industry.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chung-Mao had been actively seeking investment from Intel, but Intel was reluctant to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor due to its limited understanding of the chip industry's manufacturing ecosystem. Intel thought it was too risky and declined to invest.
Zhang Chung-Ming also acknowledged that Intel was not paying attention to the glass-making process at the time.
I never expected that the giant of Glass processing services would be so popular nowadays.
Therefore, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when Intel entered the Chinese market.
Now, the value of Intel has exceeded that of Taiwan Semiconductor.
Faced with the powerful challenge from Taiwan, Intel also dare not be passive and complacent.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor has already reached 3nm chip manufacturing, while Intel is still lingering at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to exceed one's own expectations.
He didn't wait.
I placed the order at 19:06 and it took 2 hours.
Today, let's take a look at some [weird] hot topics.
What is normal emotional behavior?
Three hot topics were randomly chosen: the Chinese New Year's Eve countdown, the good-looking friend price increase, and the shopping spree event, which spread the emotion and formed a potential wave. Finally, [a declining index (a smooth curve)] was used to dissipate the wave, and if it generated again, it would have a small peak.
It looks like the emotional intelligence model displayed on the website is different from the one they have seen before.
What is the emotion of abnormality?
Six hot spots were randomly chosen from the same event, presenting a [Mountain Peak] shape, a [Fang Shape] shape, and a [Cliff Face] shape.
[Lonely Peak] People quickly responded to the heat, cyclically exploring the topics and keeping them hot; [Cyclical Heat] Ensured the topics stayed hot and kept the conversation going; [Breaking Point] The collective withdrawal from the heat, demonstrating the full function of the topic and leading to a new task or battlefield.
In the graph, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another, at the same time and with no difference in seconds. It is certain that the united forces will accept the new mission and launch a new offensive.
You can see the professionalization of black hat activities is visible in the rise of several dozen hot topics on the same list, such as which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for profits, which ones are sparking offensive and defensive strategies, which ones are transferring the viewpoint, which ones are influencing the cognition, which ones are leading to wrong judgments, which ones are arousing emotions, and which ones are wrapping up the strategies, such as targeting accounts, segmenting the nodes, and refining the operations in a fine-grained manner, almost considering all the elements involved in the spread of emotions.
Transmission is a science, opening up a new perspective, involving emotional and subjective factors, as well as objective data, even black propaganda will be exposed.
Everyone leaves a trace, and these traces can be found together.

I received money.
The order was a fowl.
Good, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I#NAME# called your staff to explain.
Your hand told me the address was too far.
360° Integrated Home Furnishing
Address: Happy Family Garden 12th Floor, South Road 156.
Because of trust, I first introduced my friends. Therefore, I chose to take a look at the basic renovation budget of 7 million.
As soon as I entered the store, I was met with a series of scams.
I only showed them my floor plan and they didn't even bother to come to the site to measure the house. Nevertheless, they were able to give me an approximate price of my 135 sqft house which is 7 million. They didn't even know what brand of material they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you away and force you to hand over the money. (This money is gone forever unless you have enough experience and argue with them.)
When depositing money in Wuxi, they will invite their manager to tell you. If you deposit the money today, you will get a great discount.
This is an example of a scam, I lost a million dollars in the heat of the moment.
He gave me an estimate with many problems, such as 7 million not including water and electricity renovation, excluding any doors and closets, and this is the cost of the foundation.
Their service fees are much higher than other companies' fees.
I lost trust in this company and didn't know what to expect at the beginning. So I just signed the contract without making things clear.
When I went to look for them to return the money, they displayed a very experienced mannerism, with a specialized team to face you.
Regardless of how it happened, it is the customer's problem and they have no responsibility.
Different types of responsibilities, as well as many details, don't want to talk about it, don't want to choose them, because my friend found them to fix the house, also quality is bad, later give you calculate different fees.
The original fraudsters were the dragon heads of the fashion. Now they have all closed up and changed into something else.
Therefore, please don't choose such a shoddy construction company.
After everyone had chosen, they all went to Baidu to check and consult the information regarding DIY. It was not cheap to do the renovation.

This is so scary, it took 30 minutes to get through the order! Please cancel the order!
Is there any other way? For example, changing the address?
That's great, you don't have to cancel the conversation, if you don't return the item within 5-10 days, I'll pursue it.
Can I cancel the order after 15 minutes?
The chicken should be cooked, but the received was raw meat, with no way to eat it.
The sky is preparing for a huge shower of stars, mesmerizing people on the 14th day.
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12th, 2020 (Reporter Zhou Rongjian). An astronomy expert introduced the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, one of the three great meteor showers of the North Pole, the Double Zodiac Meteor Shower will arrive on December 14th, and friends who love meteor showers can observe it after dark.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing captured a double rainbow in the constellation of Ursa Major on December 13th, 2018.
Most of the periodic comets that bring us meteor showers are members of the Solar System's Oort cloud, but the mother of the meteor shower called the Lyrids is a 3200-numbered asteroid called 698 Aph2.
The second known meteor shower is the Zodiac Rain, which is not from the Zodiac Wheel but from a star.
Dr. Peng Xin, a renowned astronomer from the Tianjin Astronomical Society, gave a speech about the "upcoming shower" of star rain. Just like the Hengyuan meteor shower, it usually appears in the last days of the year, and can be seen from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is renowned for its large flow rate and stable performance. It is often compared to the Chinese constellation of the same name, and is one of the three great meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
The most prominent feature of the Double Star Rain is the slow speed of the meteoroids, the vivid colors, and the abundance of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginner photographers.
On December 13th, 2020, Yang Jing in Tianjin City, China, captured a double rainbow with a starry background.
The meteor shower of the year 2019 will arrive on December 14th or 15th at around 15:00 UT. According to the prediction, the ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors per hour seen at the zenith) will be 150.
Recommend a star chart showing the rainfall.
Last year, the Double-Zeta Rains left a deep impression on people, but this year's Double-Zeta Rains will be affected by the Moonlight Interference, resulting in a slightly reduced level of spectacularity.
On the 14th day of the lunar month, the moon is in its full phase, shining brightly and causing interference to observing the sky. It will start to get dark in the later half of the night and the radiation point of the Double Star will be higher than before.
Your friends who enjoy watching the meteor shower after the rain should observe it for about three hours after the moon falls, but take precautions against the cold and the rain.
How can we observe more meteors?
It is not advisable to observe the stars in the city, but you can select a high, bright, and open viewpoint facing east in the rural areas or suburbs, and wait patiently for the moon to fall before enjoying the view.
The flow of meteor shower rain towards each direction is very large. When observing, don't have to keep looking at the same spot of the meteor shower rain.
Your friends who love photography should think of taking starry night sky photos with a wide angle lens and a high ISO setting.
Considering stability and durability, three-legged stands, backup batteries, and quick-release cables are all essential.
Peng Teh warned him.
What differences exist between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional television that the host mentioned should be referring to liquid crystal television, while the difference between plasma and liquid crystal televisions in the market positioning mainly consists of two points:
First, LED TVs have become more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the wide market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TV is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of LED TVs is usually 75 inches or above, with the maximum size exceeding 100 inches, meeting the needs of users for large-screen televisions.
In recent years, the global demand and sales of laser TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV market size of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of the Chinese market, the LED TV market will continue to grow rapidly in 2020, with a growth rate of over 140%.
The excellent performance of the laser TV in the eye protection department is the main reason for its good performance in the large-screen market.
Based on the principle of imaging by reflection of laser beams, the light emitted from the laser source is not directly incident on the eye, compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
Researchers from the Chinese Electronics Standardization Research Institute and Beijing Eye Hospital ophthalmologists conducted a strict comparison experiment by viewing laser and liquid crystal televisions under the same conditions. The experiment yielded 144 data sets.
Data Verification: Laser TV indeed has very strong eye protection features, even in certain aspects it can have certain improvement effects.
In the face of increasing attention to eye health, laser TVs have not only benefited from the advantages of protecting eyes, but have also opened up a new breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus on the high-end market.
Contrasting the constantly dropping price of LCD TVs, the price of currently available LED TVs is still in the thousands of dollars, as the size and light source have been upgraded, resulting in a gradual increase in price.
What is so expensive about the laser TV?
It is certain to be rational.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has the advantages that LCD TV and projection can't achieve.
Thanks to advanced short-focus projection technology, the distance between the projector and the screen can be much shorter than that of traditional projection systems, allowing for a 100-inch large-screen experience in a small space with a small host and minimal footprint.
In the brightness aspect, a big brand laser TV can reach above 2000 lumens.
Adding power output is lower, causing less damage to the device, and the life span of the TV is also extended.
In addition to 4K ultra-high-definition visuals, many high-end laser TVs also come with advanced features such as artificial intelligence systems, immersive sound, and more. This can provide users with an even more exhilarating visual and audio experience.
Talking about the fake demand, instead of generalizing the product, let's discuss the details of the production and the input-output ratio, laser TV is not for video gamers' snacks, considering both the large screen and the viewing environment, you can try, whatever comes with its own benefits and drawbacks, let's weigh the pros and cons afterwards, and then judge it yourself.
A simple explanation, wide angle lens is close to the focus of the projector--laser TV, in order to attach to the screen, must use expensive wide angle lens and reflective mirror, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To protect against part of the environment light, using the fabric of the Phipps's net, the price is high, 80 inches can be exchanged for 65 inches of liquid crystal.
There is still one point I want to emphasize. I particularly detest the reflection of light from the screen of the projector when I sell the projector. Doing so will make the eyes of the customer become tired and they will not be able to see the light on the projection screen. The light is direct and the liquid crystal TV is also "direct" lighting, so when the customer opens the TV, will it be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a mirror effect, it will be useless.
The hot spot effect of the curtain was ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from one corner. That was really difficult to bear.
The photography store is the best choice for quality products, but it doesn't have a store yet.
After adding a WeChat appointment date, she just sent me the available time slots she had chosen, which was very efficient.
Before I went to the store, I had a look at the photography works inside. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The styles of photography involved were also diverse.
After having simple conversations with my little sister, I tried two different outfits and finally settled on the one I wanted. The photographer asked me to move some accessories and posed me before taking the shots. He also guided me through the different actions and was very attentive to the details.
However, due to the lack of specific shooting ideas, the photos I took weren't what I wanted. But they should still be good-looking. 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, and there will be a good communication afterwards. It will be a stylish and meticulous selection of photos.
After a month of hard work, the finished product was impressive.
The King's Feast activity of the Photography class was held again. Everyone was able to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed.
He finally chose a black blazer, experiencing a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, makeup and shooting, the photographer is the brother of 1995, feeling a bit green, hoping to give more advice in the future, talking about the shooting process is quite enjoyable.

First, I filled in my name, phone number, and address. Then, I chose my clothing. After that, I chose my wedding dress. The staff was very patient and kind. I posed for a long time and the makeup artist did a great job. The service attitude was also good. Finally, I took the photos and it felt like I was posing with the original picture. It took half a month to get the photos.
The environment overall is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
There are three makeup stations near the photography backdrop.
[Service] Very hot and very attentive.
The instructor was very patient.
The photographer will be very attentive to your actions and help you find the best poses.
The photographer will also propose retouching if he is not satisfied.
Experience has shown that the eyes may have become slightly crossed, the original double eyelid having been replaced by a triple one.
Even my eyebrows were shaved off, which made me feel a bit awkward for everyday without makeup.
The picture was taken after 10 minutes, but the P-picture effect was not satisfactory. It felt like there were two contact lenses stuck on the eyes.
After trying two styles, the result was that she chose the black suit. She said it was more elegant and classic than the other style.
After choosing the clothes, the makeover process began. The stylist and the makeup artist were super patient and worked hard to get the desired result. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
After getting dressed and done with makeup, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me in a calm and smooth manner throughout the process, which was very easy and relaxed.
After the shoot, he chose the four most favorite pictures and showed them to his brother. The outcome was very satisfactory.
I haven't received any replies for 3 days due to your system's inability to recognize my credit card, so I couldn't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay shipping fee every time.
Can I pay my monthly fee after the investigation is done?
Should I buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little umbrella is a platform for insurance and financial services on the internet.
According to the conditions set forth in the Insurance Regulatory Authority's Guidelines for Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revision): To become an insurance intermediary, you must satisfy three key words: shareholders, founding person has no record of serious law violations in the past three years, minimum capital of RMB 500 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Authority.
This is really quite difficult, summarizing it all leads to the need for strength and resilience, going through the Insurance Regulatory Authority (regulating insurance companies in China, banks) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange for approval, shareholders need to have a good investment attitude, and the umbrella insurance is legal and legitimate. In the end, it is not necessary to be too suspicious of the umbrella insurance, and it is not difficult for any insurance company to achieve this.
In this respect, it's not bad, it's worth trusting.
From an insurance perspective, umbrella insurance is akin to an insurance bazaar, with many companies' celebrities selling their high-risk policies here, such as the newly released and super-risky policy of Halle Berry 5, with its reinsurance and indemnity provided by the same people at Chubb. Umbrella insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there's no reason to doubt its neutrality.
From an operating cost perspective, the Internet platform product is more cost-effective than traditional businesses due to the absence of operating costs such as renting office space and hiring employees. Furthermore, the subscription model is flexible and allows for monthly payments, which reduces the burden of paying costs on customers. Finally, it can also be used to maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very impressive.
You can consider it.
From the perspective of professionals: This point is particularly important, because the insurance industry requires a very high degree of professionalism. There are many online product customers who can self-insure, which will lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health insurance and professional areas. In the health insurance notification and professional areas, non-insurance professionals are likely to add their own subjective opinions, feeling that their health is good or meets the requirements, which is easy to conceal the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance sales over the phone for "Tencent Weibo" (just like Little Umbrella, it is an internet insurance platform). I am very responsible for telling you this.
Internet insurance is real, but it is unreliable because it cannot be evaluated by any person or machine automatically. There are also many misleading sales on the Internet.
For example, if you buy insurance for 1 million yuan, you can get a free mobile phone and receive 6 million yuan of medical insurance. These marketing strategies have been successful, but they are not sustainable in the long run. First, the customer has to pay 1 yuan each month, and the fee increases by 200 yuan every two months. Many customers are confused about why they have to pay for something they have already bought.
Because they thought they could spend 1 yuan, the insurance company paid out 600 million yuan, but refused to pay the premium fee.
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if you win a prize, you don't have to pay for it and no one will notify you.
For those who are insured, it's just another hole in the ground. 6 million free medical insurance is short-term, if relying on this alone, without any other commercial risks, what if the real illness happens? 6 million can't solve the problem, and life will be full of worries afterwards.
Currently, the government is aggressively combating misleading internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, the platform was fine, the product was fine, and the issue was with the lack of professionalism and supervision of the staff.
Advice clients to consider their options carefully, as there are many more insurance products available online than offline, and the prices can be more competitive.
I have helped 59 online customers by providing support, guaranteeing product quality, and reducing fees by 2000-3000 RMB per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate with me and share your thoughts.
I am an experienced insurance agent with over 3 years of business management and training experience. I have served over 1000 business users, and have collaborated with over 100 insurance companies. Before the policy is issued, I will carefully listen to the customer's needs and customize the insurance product accordingly. During the policy, I will strive to provide the best coverage for the customer. After the policy is issued, I will meticulously organize the policy documents and manage the policy. This will let the customer feel at ease.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, online insurance is the process of insurance customers clicking on the insurance link and completing all the insurance procedures autonomously.
During this process, neither the insured nor the insurance agent needs to sign any documents, and all steps can be completed by the insured himself.
Although there is no "ceremony feeling" in online insurance, even the paper contracts of printing out the insurance policy may not exist, but it will not affect the validity and legality of the electronic contracts.
This kind of pattern is similar to the traditional telephone sales job, but when it comes to buying insurance, it will have a life-threatening problem, that is, - the subsequent service may not match up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contractual agreement that can last up to several decades. When buying insurance, should we carefully consider and reflect upon it? Our chosen "intermediary" should be able to accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even after many years.
How can I contact the delivery staff?
It's already 3:00 PM.
Is it supposed to give me compensation?
I said I wanted to knock on the door and send goods.
But that guy just gave it to the door, and then people just walked away.
The delivery person made a mistake and sent the wrong item.
Your hands have already taken my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still waiting for it.
My order has been received at 19:25, but the delivery person is still reluctant to leave.
I have bought all I need, do I need to go shopping elsewhere?
How do I do it?
Your horse went where?
Do you still need to wait?
I want to send a package.
Okay, you didn't cancel, so I'll call the police.
But my food may have safety and health issues.

There is no problem, remember to make no unnecessary arrangements, I have already bought, do not want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the beginning to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insults, and cannot accept any form of physical attack.
In the civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't look at the party and faction, you must first suppress such inhumane behavior.
From you I started to send out friend requests, then I posted a flirty thread on your wall, and finally I tried to publish your home address and father's name on social media, but you didn't respond.
After you tagged me, you continued to talk about me behind my back in a malicious and insidious manner. You discussed my private matters, such as my shyness, embarrassment, and physical appearance. You even talked about my sleeping and eating habits. All of this made me feel so uncomfortable and humiliated.
After I sent the picture and harassing comments to my friend, I received many messages from his friends.
I'm sorry, as a female student, I can't keep silent anymore.
After you upload the news about me reporting the police, you have not been trapped at all, instead you have become more and more aroused.
Regardless of your political background or identity, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
You can continue this type of argumentative, provocative, humiliating, and berating language, or you can continue to say that you are only concerned and interested in me, or you can continue to deny that it is harassment, or you can even continue to post all sorts of attacking and insulting language.
No, I can't, and I have no power to stop you.
Even if I don't recognize you, I don't want to recognize you. My appearance and physique do not need your evaluation and comments.
I was so ashamed that I felt like no one would want to be friends with me after what I had done.
My friend asked me, "Is everything okay?"
I said it, you won't believe it.
I think no one can be so humiliated afterward that they can't still say they're okay.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those without basic humanity and morality will choose to harm any woman in such a way.
I believe, kindness lies within everyone's heart.
I cut some comments and gave them to everyone for evaluation.
Nobody should be able to bully you for what you have written, so keep going and don't be afraid.
You are the enemy of civilization.
Smile one smile.
The People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum.
During the Vietnam National Digital Technology Industry Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss topics such as digital technology industry and the nation's digital transformation, digital technology industry and the novel coronavirus outbreak, and the economic recovery and development.
The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Mr. Nguyen Mung, expressed that although the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the number of Vietnamese digital technology companies to decrease, their revenue and growth potential remain promising, with an estimated growth rate of around 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has been actively developing digital products and concentrating on solving the major issues facing the country, resulting in an increase in the number of digital products exported and Vietnam's ranking in the digital technology sector.
Ruan Meng Xiong, the Chairman of Digital Technology Company, should take responsibility for the development of the national digital transformation platform. Taking responsibility for the development of these national digital platforms is equivalent to assuming the mission of the country.
On the forum, various departments and government agencies are leading the research, development, application, and transfer of digital technology. Companies, organizations, and individuals have shared their enthusiasm and resources to promote the development of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam, and to drive the country's digital transformation. In the wake of the epidemic, they have also come up with innovative ideas and solutions to revitalize the economy.
Vice Premier Fan Mingzhe emphasized during his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the inevitable path of the world, and it is the practical demand of development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, digital transformation services should be provided to the whole population, and thus everyone should participate.
People and enterprises are the core, body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be made for the people and businesses.
Fan Mingzhu emphasized the need to digitalize transformation, which should manifest the national spirit, with strategic, long-term and decision-making factors as priorities, and breakthrough as the ultimate goal.
He believed that digital transformation should drive deep and sustainable development, such as in the areas of COVID-19 pandemic control, economic recovery and development, adaptation to post-pandemic changes, and overcoming resource depletion. This would help promote a green transformation and sustainable energy development.
Digital transformation requires participation in the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national flavor, and the establishment of databases related to banking, taxation, land management, and the development of databases and logistics.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and powerful.
The Premier requested that all levels of government, all levels of bureaus and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance force in the development of digital technology, to further enhance their understanding of digital transformation, to continue to formulate and perfect the system regarding digital transformation, to strengthen the national management level and to adhere to the respect, communication, listening, positive and active spirit.
During the Forum, Fan Mingzhu attended the 2021 “Made in Vietnam” Excellent Digital Product Award Ceremony and the “Made in Vietnam” Digital Product Exhibition Opening Ceremony.
I have reported, and have attached a picture, but without a reply.
What cow? There's no cow.
This is a dish of water chicken, cooked meat.
There is no way to eat.
Are you sure the food is freshly cooked, instead of old?
Unacceptable.
I have already placed my order.
He said it was 7 points to send.
Why do we need to remake it?
I'm so embarrassed.

At the "Hansheng" water purifier store, you can see water purifiers and there is an activity going on inside the store. The price is quite reasonable.
Surprisingly, the house has 11 floors, the underground parking is from level 2 to level 9, and the underground parking fee is free!
The food around the circle was not good, the five-star restaurant was empty and tasteless.

Even though the house was already improved, there were still many places that had not been developed.
Address: Shaheebaq District, High-Speed Rail North 555th Road, Convenient Transportation, Large Parking Lot, Free Both Days.
Environment: In the store, there are many floors, ranging from 8 to 9. You can buy furniture, home appliances, and various other items, all of which are available. There are many famous brand stores, such as Macy's, H&M, Zara, Gucci, Old Navy, Topshop, and so on. It's overwhelming! There are so many brands that I can only remember them. It's a great place to shop for products, so I can take a break and relax on the sofa.
I recently wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friends suggested that there are many sofas to choose from here, KemKem Home and Mek Home. I felt that the price was reasonable, so I'm still deciding.

The Changjiang River Basin has achieved integrated green services coverage on the water.
On December 11th, 2019, the reporter Wang Xian visited the Chengdu City Huanhu Scenic Area in the Qinghai Province of China. This was the second water-based green service area after the Sichuan Province's Xuchang City. It was officially put into operation after the launch of the Xuchang City Green Service Area.
By this point, the Green River Integrated Service Area had covered the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yangtze.
The Yangtze River has seen the establishment of 10 green sailing integrated service areas in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu. This has been highly recognized by the seafarers and has played an important role in promoting the quality and efficiency of the Yangtze River navigation.
The event of covering the entire area of the Changjiang Green Transportation and Logistics Service Zone with a green transportation and logistics infrastructure is a significant milestone in the development of the Changjiang River. It has greatly improved the reception of pollutants and the capacity of navigation and logistics services.
As described, the Waterfront Sustainability Hub is an important facility providing comprehensive production and living services to sailors, helping them to address their urgent needs.
This newly constructed green service zone on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrates life services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme. It provides one-stop services such as ship repair and emergency rescue for vessels, making the voyage more efficient and convenient.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China and can be seen in the latest satellite images. The most powerful weapon in the U.S. arsenal is visible and can be accessed from the island of Taiwan. This is a significant signal to the region's allies and adversaries.
According to the South China Sea Strategy and Situation Awareness Platform, on January 9th, a satellite discovered the US Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the Balabac Strait.
The Sunda Strait, which connects the Java Sea and the South China Sea, is a strategic location in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
This platform is expected to be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time an F-35C fighter jet and CMV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft have been deployed aboard the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier for operational deployment.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is currently sailing in the South China Sea, apart from the "Carl Vinson" itself, there is also the "USS Abraham Lincoln" which was launched on January 3rd from the United States.
The "Lincoln" carrier strike group also deployed the F-35C carrier-based aircraft for the first time, which is a part of the US Navy's Third Fleet's Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy has a third carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is currently stationed in the Asia-Pacific region and is also based in Japan.
The naval vessels included the "Shanghai Lake"-class missile boat, the "Strike Cruiser"-class missile destroyer, and the "Sky Whirlwind"-class anti-ship cruiser.
The most powerful weapon in the U.S. is invisible and is gathering around China. On January 17th, 2022, the latest satellite image of the South China Sea was published, showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(@SouthChinaSea Strategic Situation Awareness) The US Navy has deployed its most powerful weapon to the South China Sea for a rare visit. The CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft flew along the route on 17th January 2022.
According to CNN on January 17th, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's weapons store was mysteriously missing from Guam during the weekend.
The nuclear submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-733) entered the waters of Guam Naval Base on Saturday, January 15th. It was armed with 20 Trident missiles and several dozen nuclear warheads.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have been gathering in the South China Sea, making it the most powerful weapon ever seen in the region. Analysts say this is a signal of the tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US submarine has visited the Diaoyu Islands since 2016, and it is the second time the islands have been openly visited since the 1980s.
The U.S. aircraft carrier has been gathering in the vicinity of China, the most powerful weapon is hard to find, visit Guam recently in the South China Sea, build up military installations.
The island is a popular tourist destination in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy declared in its statement that the "Inner China Delta" class of nuclear-powered submarine had been strengthened during its visit to the South China Sea, demonstrating the U.S. capability, flexibility, and readiness, as well as its commitment to the region's security and stability.
The usual name for a submarine that carries ballistic missiles is a "Boomer".
The track of the 14 submarines of the US Navy was usually kept secretly.
The secret of the submarine-launched ballistic missile, "Leapfrog" became the most important survival weapon in the world. This system also includes a domestic launch facility in the United States and B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear missiles.
Friends discussed the recent plunge in Meta's stock price, which has soared to 2510 billion US dollars, and Zuckerberg responded to "a competition it had never faced before".
Meta (formerly Facebook) is an advertising company that earns most of its revenue from advertising, which is a company that has a flow of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc. are all Meta's traffic channels, regardless of what kind of function they are positioned.
Not only this, but Meta is also the greatest "Advertising Alliance". Many Apps outside the Meta advertise through its advertising platform, which enables transformation.
However, the times have changed.
First, due to Apple's privacy policy changes, it has become difficult for Metta to obtain user data, which has affected its advertising efficiency.
Apple's privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will display a very clear prompt to users whether they allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google further sharpens its sword, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor of Meta's income growth has weakened (the weight of which is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income each year comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies' contributions to the maritime industry.
There are about 100 people in the office in Hong Kong, and there are several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is the only reliable advertising channel. Spending a lot of money on it has become a trend.
One of Meta's main competitors is TT, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from byte.
Agents from all over China have been helping each other to go to the Meta region to post advertisements. The performance of the Meta Chinese region is also very good.
I haven't been specializing in it recently, but I'm sure it will be better than before.
Chinese companies have already passed the phase of large-scale overseas money burning.
Third, the new flow channel was not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and older, with new platforms such as TT included in it. They are not in the Meta hand anymore.
The biggest problem is not only income decline, but also lack of growth expectation.
Not only do we need to look at current income in the capital market, but it is also important to look at our expectations for the future.
It was very obvious that the expectations for Meta were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zack Brown talked about “The Universe”.
The universe of Meta should be one of the directions of the future, but its implementation cycle is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support its growth in the next three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be more difficult than ever for Meta.
Don't look at the bright side of the current wind, the annual income of 1,000 billion to 2,000 billion US dollars, the current Microsoft crisis is very strong, compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security of the castle river.
Although his various social media platforms are currently popular, they are all mainstream social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but he is no match for TikTok's rapid growth, so he has no confidence and is unable to challenge it. It is just a matter of blind luck.
This concept of the universe which can be contemplated yet unattainable within a short time, is full of hope yet to be successful, so it is extremely dangerous, which is why Sukhothai is always changing its name, and is always in search of new paths, but I think his choice of path is wrong, it is a wrong turn.
