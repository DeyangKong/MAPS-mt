Even though there's nothing interesting on TV, I still watch it out of habit.
Why did it become impossible for the Tekakon to appear on TV?
Yesterday I was watching Netflix in Chirori, but it was so boring that even the staff started laughing at the funny scenes.
"It's not funny when you're just making a fool of yourself, but it's hilarious when a comedian is doing it," said the man with a smirk.
Even though the staff didn't laugh, the artist's bad attitude made the workplace unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and ordinary. Some of the artists are also unhappy with the attitude.
I can't help but feel a deep sense of admiration for the artist when I see them struggling with their own work.
Even though income is quite low at the moment, I'm trying to make ends meet by selling my art. But it seems like a never-ending task since I'm constantly struggling to find the right words to express my ideas.
There is a lack of proper recognition for comedians and other entertainers in the media and society, despite the fact that they are becoming increasingly popular.
Although there are some difficult parts in the entertainment industry, artists have to keep trying their best and never give up.

I was so surprised when I received the wrong item I had ordered from the online store.
You are requested to send the wireless mouse you ordered and it will be replaced with a wired one if you wish to return it.
Despite the notoriety of self-built PCs, it is impossible to obtain knowledge without considering the trouble.
We discovered that a Wi-Fi Gaming Mouse for 3,280 yen (including tax) was on sale at Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo's Day Sale.
Since the same price was found at the storefront, the possibility of price misconception was considered and the page of the wireless version was also confirmed to be 5,071 yen (Link to Unicorn). Therefore, there was no misconception of price when ordering.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day delivery mail also arrived normally.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order until the shipment of the wireless mouse that was ordered, I thought it would arrive at that time.
From here it became a problem, and after delivery it took several hours for the message "There was an error in product registration" to come.
According to that email...
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version that was being sold.
Since we are already shipping wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse and get a refund.
Use a wireless mouse.

Even though it was the second time in a row that the town was isolated due to a typhoon and heavy rain, the only bridge leading to the town was flooded out by the disaster. The residents had to stock up on food supplies three times as much. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa Village, Furukawa District, Fukushima Prefecture.
The devastating impact of the 2019 East Japan Typhoon was particularly felt in the 3rd quarter of the year.
Mr. Matsumoto san : "At first, it was a feeling of'magic'."
It was a terrible feeling when the only road connecting the Takahara district, 「Takahara Bridge」 was washed away by the Tohoku Pacific typhoon. 30 residents of the district were left in a desperate situation.
The citizens of Japan who were strong enough to survive the Tsunami were forced to use the steel bridge of the JR railway company everyday to carry the necessary materials.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's great that the bus can come all the way from the station to the garden. You can just get off the bus and start walking, or if you're feeling lazy you can just hold onto the handrail and walk across the bridge. It's so much better than taking the bus and dealing with the traffic and the hassle of finding a taxi. It's really nice that they built the bridge so quickly." One month after the bridge was completed, it was washed away by a sudden rainstorm. For three months, the village was once again in a state of isolation.
After two years of rebuilding from the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing his efforts to educate people about disaster prevention.
Masamune Shirow, creator of Ghost in the Shell, thinks there are about 10 cases of it.
We should ensure that people have enough to eat for two to three days. Canned goods and instant noodles, for example, can be used for emergency food.
Ms. Matsuko San said, "I don't know when the disaster will strike, but I'm preparing for it by stocking up on supplies and hoping for the best." Meanwhile, Shimizu Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" which had never been imagined before.
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to devise its own unique curriculum from that year onwards.
The town of Kagami is planning to hold a special day to prepare for disasters in the future, on October 12th. The education chief, Takashi Kagami, says it's a good idea and hopes to make it an annual event.
Even though we have experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.

When buying used houses, beware!
The hole caused by the collapse of the building status survey system (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
The newly established "Building Condition Survey System" is expected to boost the activity of the used housing market.
The price of construction and the demand for renovation are both increasing, with the priority of sale processes for housing rising in tandem.
As the number of people who are looking for a place to live increases due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the demand for affordable housing has grown significantly. This has caused a surge in popularity of “station-adjacent”, “station-near”, and “station-direct” properties, as well as “towers” which are represented by words such as “large”, “massive”, and “sky-high”.
Despite the fact that the existing (used) housing share in Japan is still relatively low compared to overseas, it has been steadily increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started an inspection of building conditions for the purpose of ensuring safe and secure used housing transactions in 2018 (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a builder who has become skilled in residential construction checks the condition of the building and reports it to the buyer by summarizing the condition of the building in a checklist.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers with the introduction of inspections.
By performing inspections before purchase and avoiding claims afterward, the seller can provide the buyer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been increasing in the workplace.
On the other hand, it is possible to understand the condition of the used house you are going to buy in advance, and it is beneficial to be able to purchase it quickly.
On the system of the current building inspection, the main responsibility for leading the inspection lies with the seller.
It is important to pay attention to the fact that the notification of the inspection system has become obligatory at the same time.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to inspect the building conditions when handling a property, but in practice, it is not obligatory.
● Inspection of used car dealers is a risk that is already being experienced in Japan. However, in foreign markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where used cars are actively traded, similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stages of a real estate transaction, the buyer typically hires specialists such as inspectors and building surveyors to conduct a building inspection before signing the contract.
For example, in the case of America, the inspection rate of used houses in the state is around 70 to 90%.
The main difference between a "seller-led" inspection and a "buyer-led" inspection is that the former is led by the seller, while the latter is led by the buyer.
The seller can usually see the condition of the building from a little distance, and try to sell it quickly at a higher price.
The landlord is thought to be considering the survey content carefully and performing the necessary repairs and maintenance to make it a pleasant place to live.
Even if we have the same goals and thoughts, there is still a chance of misunderstanding due to language barrier.
Therefore, the following points are highlighted as potential risks for the Japanese system: 1. Lack of transparency 2. Complexity 3. Slow decision-making 4. Dependence on external actors 5. Unpredictability 6. Potential for capture by vested interests.
This country's retailers must adhere to the minimum standards set by the government when it comes to inspections.
For inspection companies, there is a risk of missing important defects if they don't conduct thorough investigations.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the seller fails to report unfavorable survey results or shows "ingratitude".

This place was once part of the Ryukyu Islands.
That's why it's a bit difficult to find a place to expose your own little bit of scholarly research in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square in Tokyo. It's quite interesting and entertaining.
Let's go up to the Ginza!?
He dived into the goldfish bowl.
As you walk down Silver Street, you can see the changing names of places, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shops that have been left behind.
As they walked through Ginza, they were suddenly overwhelmed by a silence that reminded them of the past.
Was Ginza a suburb of Tokyo?
The phrase "Ginza" has become a synonym for bustling shopping and dining scenes in various cities in Japan, such as Tokyo's Ginza district.
The Ginza, which is known as a fashionable shopping district in Tokyo, was originally a silver coin mint in 1612 (Kan'ei 17). It was moved to present-day Tokyo in 1868.
At that time, it was referred to as "New Exchange Town", but it was later renamed "Ginza" and became widely known by that name.
According to the news, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the entrance of Marunouchi was through the Nihonbashi Bridge. Then, a half island called "Edoji" gradually extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The leading edge of that island is currently located in Tokyo.
Tokugawa Ieyasu began the construction of Edo Castle and filled in the moat, leading to the development of the Kyobashi district.
We will further improve public health and develop water transportation by strengthening the digging of canals.
They dug a hole, filled it with earth from the ruins of the castle and Mount Inari, and built a shrine there.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worth taking a look.
People should know about the "Sacred Pilgrimage" of Ginza.
The Ginza Hachiman Shrine is known for its "Ginza Hachiman Shrine MEGURI" ritual, which is held annually.
This shrine is the most popular tourist destination in the area. It is located in front of the famous Kabuki Theater.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki theatre.
On the one hand, "Ryukuou Fudou-Jin" is located on the second floor of Ginza Matsuya, while "Ginza Doutsu-Jin" is located on the ninth floor of Ginza Sengoku 9.
The shrines "Torii Shrine" and "Atsuta Shrine" are located in the depths of the road, but "Atsuta Shrine" is famous for being respected by the Kabuki actor Nakamura Kanzaburō. The "Torii Shrine" is located in the entrance of the Success Shrine Building 1F, and it is a non-public shrine other than the time of visiting the Hachiman Shrine.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian spirits as well as the gods of the land and sea. However, most shrines only worship the gods of the harvest by offering rice and other crops as a sacrifice.
In front of the shrine, a fox would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the shrine was built with the hope of receiving the good fortune of a bountiful harvest.
This shift has resulted in an increase in commercial activity, as well as a widening of religious diversity in Tokyo and other large cities in Japan, such as Kyoto and Edogawa.

The Korean company Posco has acquired the Senegalese energy company Enagás, and is looking to expand its overseas gas business. This news was reported by the Korean media (WoW!Korea).
Posco International announced on November 12 that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement and an investment agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, aiming to invest in Senex Energy's acquisition of Hancock Energy.
Since there are still some procedures left to be done, such as the approval of the Board of Directors and the local corporation, the purchase and sale procedures will be completed in March next year.
This year's acquisition by Posco International in 2010 and subsequent integration into the Posco Group was the world's largest ever M&A (merger and acquisition) case.
The total amount of purchase and sale was 7709 billion yen, with Posco International investing 50.1%, and Hancock Natural Resources investing 49.9%.
Posco International has been increasing its demand for natural gas continuously in the energy transition era, and has been playing a leading role in the development of the blue hydrogen market by introducing green hydrogen together with natural gas.
Posco International will secure 802Bcf of natural gas storage and 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in Korea through this purchase. It will also secure human resources for land-based gas field operations in the area.

That pain in your knee, could it be "Chondromalacia Patellae"?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC - Yahoo! News)
The Editing Department: Recently, the pain in my knee has been persisting.
What kind of illnesses are possible?
Professor Maruyama: The cause of pain in the knee joint can be varied, such as patellar tendinitis, joint inflammation, and iliotibial band syndrome.
Skeletal dysplasia is common among Japanese people.
Is it possible that the editing team will be affected by the changes in the schedule?
Maruyama-sensei: That's right.
In reality, the surface of the joints are covered with a soft tissue, allowing for the absorption of impact and the smooth movement of the joints.
As we age, overeating, and strenuous exercise can lead to softening of the bones and misalignment of the joints.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformities and inflammatory diseases.
Does hemangioma, which is characterized by abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, also occur in other parts of the body apart from the knee?
Maruyama-sensei: Yes.
You may experience pain in other parts of the body, such as the knee, wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, ankle, and heel.
However, the most common case is "scoliosis", which is an abnormal curvature of the spine.
Editing Team: What kind of structure does the joint have?
Professor Maruyama said, "The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are irregularly arranged."
Therefore, the part that is covered by this 2-layered structure is the joint cartilage, and the surrounding area is covered by the joint capsule.
The Editorial Board is complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
There is a layer of smooth tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule, which creates synovial fluid to lubricate the joint.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and condroilin sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joints smoothly requires good sources of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms do people with Scoliosis suffer from?
Professor Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of viscoelasticity, so it can act as a shock absorber to prevent direct contact between bones.
Iwaba is playing the role of a cushion.
Unfortunately, this can cause joint deformities, inflammation, and pain.

The trap-filled Pachinko Parlor "Nu" appeared in the movie "Pachinko Breaking Bad".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the customers.
This "pond" has a huge trap set up by the 3-stage dungeon's moving object, making it almost impossible to be conquered.
He employed every possible means to topple the giant, from pouring water from a barrel of vinegar to setting up a cement foundation.
The character "Kai" from the anime "Kai-Ni-Pachi" has become popular and is now appearing in many arcades where people are playing the game.
Although the price of items such as the One Piece 4000 Yen is lowered, it is still possible to get the quality you desire.
The "Star Side Party" held a cash prize for those who included a kai jin in their outfit, and the participants were ordered to do the Tetsubo-wari, or human horse racing, which is a part of the "Human Horse" event.
The debtors were running as fast as they could while carefully avoiding the thin steel bars installed atop the ground 10 meters above, and competing for speed.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win prize money, but the steel bar is only 4 pieces long and safety measures are insufficient, making the chance of death quite high.
This bridge was supposed to be developed as a VR game, but it is now a part of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles' home stadium, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi". It is possible to have an extremely close experience by walking on the bridge.
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors above ground), with a steel bridge at the end, and a "Victory Bridge" and a "Skywalk" leading to it. People can walk there.
Of course, safety measures are in place.

This game has an excellent balance, the Emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the Emperor.
Kaji is challenging the protagonist of the drama, Renga River, to a fight with a strict rule of "If you lose, you will cut your own ears off".
A device that could sense changes in pulse and temperature, such as feeling the iPhone in one's ear, was able to read the mind by destroying the ear canal. The river Ganges was confused by the extreme value of its own body by cutting off the ear canal. Thus, it was victorious.

The ends of the net are open so that stores can be accessed through them.

Even though we were about to be scattered, we still had a few moments of laughter and joy. But it was all too short-lived, and soon it was time to say goodbye.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I was able to understand Paul and George's conversations! I was so surprised! Then, I started to talk slowly and carefully, and it felt like time was standing still. I was so amazed by this strange feeling!
It's so tiring to hear that kind of bickering all the time. But then, when I think about it, it's really not worth getting worked up over. It's just a waste of time and energy. That's why I try to stay positive and just keep working. That way, I can avoid getting into a bad mood and feeling down. That's what I think, anyway.

Even though it was only three chapters into the story, the biggest cause of the disbandment of the team was the environment around them.

Talking about it, a producer and some promoters came up with the idea of "Let's take the Beatles around the world!" They started to spread the word and soon they became popular. Everyone was amazed by their unique and wonderful performance.
Since the documentary is about to explain the director's interpretation, it is remarkable that Peter Jackson felt that way……
It seems that Paul is always surrounded by bad people in the movie scenes, so I thought he was the villain.

I had to change my job because I was getting too sick from the work I was doing. I had been working in the service industry, but I wanted to do something different.

I eventually decided to become a bartender, and it has been the best decision I've ever made. I love being able to interact with customers and make them feel welcome. I'm so glad I was able to make the switch!

In America, a severe weather system is bringing a mix of rain, snow, and strong cold temperatures (Weather News - Yahoo! News)
A tornado outbreak occurred in South America from 10th (Friday) night to 11th (Saturday) day.
As a result of strong cold air from the south below, the atmospheric condition became very unstable and thick clouds developed rapidly.
A record-breaking heatwave from the southwest has swept across the south of America, bringing temperatures not seen in decades.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Monday (9th) and Tuesday (10th).
In a place where the record-breaking warmth had settled, around 5500 meters below, a strong cold air from the south had descended, resulting in an active frontal system with a well-defined warm front and a rapid development of the convective clouds along the front.
It was observed that tsunamis were occurring regularly in the outskirts.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage decreases significantly during the summer and early fall.
The record-breaking typhoon warning, which was announced on a single day in the winter season, reached 150 times closer than before.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in America has reportedly received over 400 reports of storms and tornadoes in just 10 days (Friday) alone.
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the United States that are heavily concentrated along the southern and northern lines that extend from the state of Texas to the state of California. One area includes the state of California, and the other includes the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
In the state of Kansas, the intensity of the tornado was displayed on the improved Fujita Scale (EF Scale) and reached the third strongest EF3 level, with instantaneous gusts of 70 meters per second either side of it being observed.
By conducting the survey in the future, it is possible to determine whether EF4 or EF5 will be used.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the conditions of Japanese buildings in accordance with the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of destruction caused by JEF3 is comparable to that of a typhoon in America.

New Game
The roar of "the world's greatest sumo wrestler" from beneath the ring has been broadcast live to help him in his quest (Yahoo! News).
The US President addressed the damage caused by the Tsunami in the US Central and Southern states and the Japanese Time on November 11th (12th in Japan) and showed a remarkable grasp of the situation with a divine and mysterious aura.
CNN and other American television networks reported it.
Mr. Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the disaster.
Fear of death exceeding 100 people has spread in Japan.
Residents of KenTucky State, who were affected by the tornado, were seen carrying household items such as furniture and appliances from damaged homes to clear the debris on the night of May 10th and early morning of May 11th.
The record of tornadoes causing damage in 1925, such as in Mizoram State, India, is still left. American meteorologist of CNN specializing in weather has estimated the maximum extent of this tornado to be around 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In the wake of the devastating tornado in Kennett, Missouri, the Christmas shopping season was marred by a 24-hour state of emergency at the large factory, resulting in immense damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and no traces were left.
In the darkness of the cave, the weight of the woman who couldn't move her legs due to the thickness of the cave wall was felt by the rescue worker, who was searching for her above the cave wall. She was eventually rescued through live broadcasting from her smartphone.
In addition to the female vocalist's plea for help, the sound of weeping and another female vocalist's terrifying wailing were heard in the live broadcast of "Happy Birthday to You".
The convenience store employee, Anber Brown, who lived in Meifield, was alerted to a tornado warning by a phone call from his 5-year-old son. He quickly hid himself and his family in the basement of their house, and luckily nothing bad happened.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a fearsome sound like a low rumble of the ground.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take to rescue them. But we must continue our desperate efforts.
In Irino, Ibaraki Prefecture, a warehouse of an online shopping mall collapsed, and at least 6 people were confirmed dead.
The shockwave from the train car being detached is causing the fences to shake and the roads to be blocked by overturned vehicles.
According to media reports, over 40,000 shelters in Tennessee have been affected by the power outage.

What is the difference between a female-specific doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology and a regular doctor?
A specialist doctor (専修医) is usually a medical doctor who has completed postgraduate training and has been practicing for 3 to 5 years after graduation.
The two types of doctors in Japan are "specialist doctors" and "post-graduate doctors".
It is commonly known that "research medical" refers to the fact that a doctor graduated as a "research medical" and then completed a year of training before officially becoming a doctor.
Even if you are not mature yet, you can still be mature enough to some extent by the time you are 4 or 5 years old. Therefore, you can be entrusted with various tasks.

It is an old saying that approaches to evaluating star systems are different from each other.
Other countries are reducing their points based on five stars as a standard, while Japan is increasing/reducing its points based on three stars.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard time, but four stars become "poor element" and "beautiful star" in different meanings.
If we use the same criteria to judge a product with five stars, then the product can be classified as either "defect-free" or "excellent" depending on its quality. However, if we present the star system without any quality assurance, then the product can be classed as "defective" due to its flaws. Therefore, it is better not to attach any stars to the product.

Issue of Self-made Radio
I tried to make an AM radio with a condenser and coil but there was too much noise so I couldn't hear it clearly.
The frequency of the radio station was different from the one I heard, but the sound was the same.

<Saga News> Hakobune's "Fresh Seafood Sushi and Sashimi" - Make it at Home with Easy-to-Find Ingredients
"Fresh Sashimi and Sushi made with Fish from the Nearby Sea"
A colorful bounty of vegetables, carefully crafted into delicious takeout dishes at the specialty store "Hakobune".
"We want to make a restaurant where people can enjoy delicious food at a reasonable price," said Kikuchi Takayuki (39) and his wife, Yumi (38). The couple opened a restaurant in August last year.
One of the popular menu items at the sushi restaurant is "Fresh Seafood Sushi and Ebi Fry" (1000 yen).
Fish are sometimes bought as goods at the market.
As Ebi-Fry is made with a light dusting of flour, the flavor of the fry is direct and delicate.
Vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, onions and potatoes are used to make a hearty meal of Hino Hikari rice from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are usually grown in a home garden and then sold at local markets.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Mr. Kagayaki adds a touch of color to the table with his French-style cooking, such as ratatouille and salads.
One of the unique flavors of "taste-acquiring" dumplings, such as those made by Mrs. Umezawa, is becoming widely popular among the younger generations.
Popular food items include Japanese-style hand-crafted ramen from Hanbaekg (1000 yen).
From next year, we will also be selling the processed meat product "Sharky's Set" which can be used for making wine.

A family's long journey to protect the environment in China's rural areas has been featured in the Japanese media. (JBpress News) - Yahoo! News
(Katou Yasuyuki: Hong Kong Companies Find Asia Consultant) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, and the species of mammals that live there are the world's first, and the species of plants are the world's third.
We recognize the value of biodiversity as perceived by local governments and are actively promoting environmental protection as well as environmental activities by local governments.
Sichuan Province, located in the western part of China, is one of the regions in the country.
Siam Paran is a region located on the border of Laos and Myanmar, which is the starting point of the Tai (Tai) people and the Lue (Lue) people of the Kingdom of Thailand. It is a region where many minority ethnic groups live and work together.
The source river of the Mekong is flowing through and across Southeast Asian countries.
The Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture is located in the central part of China, with an area of only 0.2% of the country's total. However, it is home to 25% of the country's wildlife and 20% of its flora.
This time, I visited Lixin Liu, the founder of the environmental protection activity in Shanghai, and had a talk with him about the contents of the activity.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together ― They have been doing it for 20 years.
What was the purpose of that?
Lee started our environmental protection action "Tenchu" in 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This place is the only tropical rainforest region in China, and it boasts abundant biodiversity.
Despite the slowdown, the economy still managed to make progress.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, China was short of rubber and had to resort to large-scale felling of tropical rainforest.
He was sent here from Germany to study the restoration and research of natural resources.
After that, I was married to the journalist I met here.
Didn't Li already have an interest in natural conservation before?
Mr. Li, I am from Shishapangma, but I have no interest in the significance and biodiversity of tropical rainforests.
We have become accustomed to advancing the project without knowledge or experience.
Even though people don't look at the person with the high back, there are some people who are curious about it. Why is that?
A popular actor said something.
There is nothing to buy at the store.
In that moment of confidence, a natural thing will come out from within.

It's polite to comment on the other person's clothing, but it's better to be subtle about it, right?
Is it okay if it's a bit thin?
It's obvious, isn't it?
I think it's too complicated.
It's been a while since anyone has said anything, so I'm not sure what the meaning is.

It took about a month to identify the cause of the CTD in a MOD environment.
They had to spend a lot of time trying to identify the cause of the problem, which was exacerbated by the lack of time to play with the data from March onwards.
Why wasn't the.Net Script Framework used to analyze the logs? (It can be figured out in a few minutes.) Some errors are related to DLL and assembly conflicts, which can't be fixed by a crash log.
The timing of the main CTD is important.
* All Papyrus and.NET Script Framework, log files should be saved without footprints.
If NPCs are killed in large numbers in a short period of time, the console will crash. This can be fixed by updating the SKSE plug-in or powerofthree's revised version.
* When the camera work for the kirmite activation against NPCs is off, it can be improved by setting the kirmite settings to off via the.ini file. However, the upper limit of the number of kirmite animations is 10,000, which may be a problem for DAR+Nemesis related settings.

Thinking about the importance of mental health nursing - Today's visiting nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from dual-diagnosis, I have been undergoing long-term counseling and therapy. However, I am fortunate to have formed a strong bond with the visiting nurse who has been providing my care. She is very patient and has built a great relationship with me.
We have conversations about all sorts of things every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and dressings in the nursing care (such as wound care), it is more important for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which I found out in today's visiting nursing care.
Today, we discussed the differences between men and women, as well as gender theory, and it was quite amusing.
What happened when she wanted to divorce her husband? Did she visit a nurse to talk about it?
Although I was wearing a tamagotchi, I was also dressed as a girl.
When the visiting nurse station is located in a hospital, the hospital-based occupational therapist cannot be expected to provide any practical assistance, nor can the visiting nurse come and go as she pleases. Instead, she is told to "stay away from medical matters" from above, and is instructed to do so by talking about how the hospital is doing its job.
Although the visiting care station I am using is run by a social welfare organization, I hope to find a wonderful nurse who is respectful to me and my peers, and who is willing to listen to me and take good care of me.
You are so beautiful.
It is likely that both those who are receiving psychiatric care and those who are contemplating it will benefit from the experience.
Visiting a nurse is very beneficial for those suffering from mental illness.
If the doctor confirms it, please take it.
Then, choose a good visiting nurse station.
Even though I was angry, I released myself from the contract without any prior warning.

China's five-year delay in implementing the Hydrogen Economy Load Map has slowed down. (Central China News in Japanese)
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 6000 electric vehicles in Japan and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of hydrogen was 6,000 yen (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
Unfortunately, the target of 27% fuel cell vehicles in the 2011 fiscal year has not been achieved yet. (Approximately 1700 units)
The percentage of hydrogen stations in Japan has reached 38% (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is almost the same as the load map announced at the time of the previous announcement.
It became clear that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap is falling short of its targets.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) released a report on the "Current Situation and Policy Directions" of the Hydrogen Economy on December 12.
According to reports, the nuclear industry's core components and materials are mainly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Toho (Japan) supplies the core material of the automobile battery, such as carbon fiber, to Kyocera (Japan), DuPont (USA), Mitsubishi (Japan), Goodyear (USA), and 3M (USA).
Six countries are leading the hydrogen market, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany. The number of hydrogen technology patents registered in these countries has been increasing at an average of 14% per year since 2014.
Korea is the fifth largest country in the world in terms of patent applications in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020).
The World Trade Organization (WTO) currently consists of 6 major countries that control the majority of the world's water element market. In reality, these 6 countries are the lower-tiered competitors.
The order of priority for patent applications by country is China, United States, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has been steadily expanding its lead over the US in terms of economic and military power.
In 2020, Japan was ranked fourth in the world in terms of patent applications, with 974, while China had 4721 patent applications, accounting for 22% of the world's total.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has proposed to designate "Hydrogen Technology" as a "National Strategic Technology" with large investment, research and development expenses tax exemption.

Is it okay to ask for donations while doing volunteer work?
Volunteer work is not free, so it is important to be honest and sincere when doing it. Even though it may be difficult, a person must persevere.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine as part of a training mission for its troops (CNN.co.jp).
A U.S. State Department official reported on December 12th that equipment containing firearms and explosives, based on the assistance plan approved by the Biden Administration, had arrived in Ukraine.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million dollars (approximately 68 billion yen) and is being transported to Ukraine. The last equipment item included in the aid is a radar system to identify launch sites for rocket attacks.
According to the US Defense Department, these weapons also included "Javelin" anti-tank missiles.
The purpose of Russia's military support to Ukraine is to strengthen its national defense capabilities, including by receiving weapons and equipment to boost its military power along the border.
The U.S. is monitoring Russia's movements and has been consulting with NATO allies and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to devise a response in case Russia invades Ukraine.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the White House on September 1, 2019, and admitted to accepting weapons assistance from the United States.
The scale of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine this year has reached around 4 billion dollars.
After Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, the total amount of aid from Japan exceeded 250 billion yen.
The U.S. military also participated in Ukraine's training exercises.
The state of Florida sent troops to participate in the multinational exercises for the support of Ukraine.
According to the statement of the U.S. Department of Defense, the European special operations forces are playing a significant role in training and advising the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces deployed in Ukraine is not publicly known.
Biden was supposed to meet with Putin on the 7th of this month, but the tense situation in Ukraine prevented it from happening.
If the United States is attacked, it will impose a harsh economic sanction.

The LDP's Akira Amari, who was in charge of tax reform, was directly attacked for advocating for the suspension of the consumption tax.
The first special issue of Weekly Diamond magazine, published on December 18th, is titled "Family Talk at the End and Beginning of the Year".
This is a technique of sending and receiving gifts before and after a meeting.
In the discussion of integrating the taxes on gifts and pre-gifts, the dreadful 2022 tax reform was brought up, but in the near future, pre-gift giving may be restricted more and more as a form of tax evasion.
What will change the rule of succession?
The LDP's former tax chief, Koichi Kato, has been actively promoting tax cuts and other economic policies since the party's victory in the 2019 election. He has been sharing his knowledge on taxation and other economic policies without reserving any topics for later.
(Diamond Editing Team, Kyōgaron Tetsu)
We should consider the taxation of pre-emptive donations from the perspective of taxing the transfer of assets, and make a neutral tax system that takes into account the timing of asset transfers.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill announced by the party last year has caused a great stir throughout the entire society, from the wealthy to the middle class.
That is why we should not forget that changing the rules of succession and increasing taxation are the two major ways to increase tax revenue.
The steel rule of reducing taxable income by accumulated sales tax is "Taxable assets become less".
That powerful legacy gift has been widely utilized by companies even though it is a small amount, since it is tax-deductible even for those who own a home in the three major cities.
This discussion is about the concept of "unified taxation" of income and donations.
On December 10th, 2020, the 22nd Annual Tax Revision Committee released a draft of the tax reform plan, titled "Making Clear the Nature of Gift and Inheritance Taxes". The plan proposed a number of changes to the current tax system, such as clarifying the nature of gift and inheritance taxes, increasing the tax-free allowance, and introducing a new taxation system for inherited assets. The committee also stressed the importance of continuously reviewing the plan in order to ensure its effectiveness.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Audit, Mr. Kamiyama, were speaking.
For that reason, it is most important to equalize the advantages and disadvantages of transferring wealth at different times.
"Underneath it all, what kind of problem is likely to arise due to the process of unification, and where is the simulation taking place?" The chance to make a donation before death has been reduced to three times.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, in the near future we should avoid acting in the direction of cutting large taxes and instead prioritize pre-birth gifts.
How will the rules of succession tax and donation tax change specifically?

The team that won the first three games of the NFL season felt a variety of emotions, according to the players (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News).
Jones threw the pass three times, but Pitts only caught it once.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season when the Bills played the New York Jets in a historic game. It had been 50 years since then.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, a talented RB who had broken the season record of 2000 yards for the first time in history, played for the Buffalo Bills.
The Bulldogs crushed the Simpson and Blackstone RBs in the 40-yard dash.
The reason for the extreme offensive of the Payton Rottweilers was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains oriented towards the North Pacific Ocean.
The temperature dropped significantly before the game, with a wind speed of 18m/s, and snowfall had already begun.
Unfortunately, the play selection didn't change much.
You should run 25 times for 30 passes.
Alen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
Interception was impossible, but we persisted indefatigably.
There were 4 Red Zone invasions in the Offensive Series and the Defensive Team got 10 points.
After the third quarter, they continued to run all the way to the red zone.
Unfortunately, she was only able to steal three points in that game.
The defense in the final round of the game.
The building that was chasing after the 4th penalty was arrested at 3rd & 9, and became 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
The quarterback was surrounded by the defense's rush at the 3rd&14 and eventually escaped to the right side of the field by throwing the ball from the pocket.
He threw a pass but it was unsuccessful.
In this game, WR Steffon Diggs ran around the end zone and became free, but Allen's eyes were not able to catch him.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from the outside of the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabriel Dumont. The pass was incomplete and Arlen Harris failed to reach the end zone, resulting in a failed attempt.
Although Brain was covering the WR Cornerback position with his body, he suddenly released the ball and reacted to the pass in the middle of the game.
The receiver watched the ball fall to the ground twice and then passed it to the endzone.
The fourth down was unexpected, but the third down was not important enough to warrant a TD hunt.
If you can achieve a first down in two attempts at the play, it will be worth it.

3 items to make your kitchen more organized in the long run: 1. A timer 2. A replacement for your cutting board 3. A storage container (Harper's BAZAAR)
Sponge
Even if you frequently change the sponge, it will eventually become worn out and will need to be replaced.
Even though kitchen sponges are often used to clean dishes, they can also be a source of bacterial growth if not properly sanitized. Recent research has revealed that bacteria can rapidly multiply in kitchen sponges even when they are exposed to electronic sanitizers.
The German researcher who conducted this study recommended that people should wash their hands with soap for one week to keep them clean.
A smooth board.
The United States Department of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to replace damaged or worn out wooden planks with new ones.
When wounds and scars start to progress, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria start to multiply.
Even if you are still healthy, it is important to frequently disinfect your tabletops and surfaces with a 1:16 dilution of a non-scented liquid disinfectant.
Immerse a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.
In a beautiful, clear water, use a gentle, clean paper towel to wipe the water gently and dry it lightly.

Although this way of handling is exceptional, it is still effective if done properly. For example, if you are handling a gin, it is important to be careful with your teeth.

Even though he has no relation with them, he always raises his glass higher than everyone else at the bar when his white friend orders a drink.

Some people may also want to have more freedom to make their own decisions and to have more privacy. Ultimately, the reasons why people want to live alone are unique to each individual.

After studying the sword "Kamiwakaru Kodachi", I have become strong enough to fight in a battle.
The exchange of effort is the essence of humanity, as seen in the anime "Ueki no Honoo". (QJWeb Quick Japan Web)
Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been causing a stir among the youth. It is said to be full of "exciting" and "daring" content.
There is no battle in the Daitei, but readers still enjoy reading it. The reason is that it is popular for its relaxing atmosphere.
It was only after two years of hard work that the same manga "One Piece" was completed, with the artist drawing only with a brush and no color.
The mysterious charm of the exotic landscape is one of the attractions of the place. However, there is a tendency that people tend to stay in the same place and not to change it.
After the main character, Ashitaka, completed his training with the sword of the demon slayer, he thanked the brave and loyal San, and offered to help him regain his lost power. San accepted and asked him to help him reclaim his power, saying "It's time to take back what's rightfully ours!"
Weaklings have no rights, no choice, and no power. They can only be oppressed by the strong.
"Sou-gintsu" (lit. "Demon Slayer Corps Entrance Examination Hopeful") Tsuchikage left the area near the Kagami-ike Pond and introduced the nearby shrine. (This is either a reference to the character's noble and generous nature or a shameless attempt at fan service.)
When the first contact between Shiro and Kagami happened, Shiro was told that "If you were to be eaten by a human, what would you do?" and Shiro replied with "It's too late to make a decision now."
In the midst of fan chatter, a never-ending stream of meaningless banter ensues.
It is possible that a moment will come when I am forced to make a decision between following my sister and walking away from the demon.
This can be called an initiation from the imagination to the work.
We set off to climb the mountain in the mist, taking Carrot-san with us. We descended to the mountain hut by the time the sun rose.
The mountain was covered in caves, traps, and boulders, making it a dangerous place to enter before death.
Despite the strong smell of the stew, they diligently continued to stir it with their hands, and eventually it became the correct "Prince's Stew".
However, I believe that it is the same for everyone - that when faced with a sudden and unexpected challenge, we all have the innate ability to rise up and overcome it.
Ordinary people suddenly become powerful without knowing the secret of the hidden strength and skill. If they wake up, they can use the power and technique they have developed until now in a natural way.
Those who put in effort are entitled to get paid, but those who don't put in effort should not expect anything in return. The rule of "No work, no pay" is not applicable to the superhuman force of effort, which is celebrated in a different manner in this work.

Samsung Electronics has established a new "DX" department which emphasizes user experience and integrates home appliances and mobile products. (WoW!Korea - Yahoo!News)
Following Samsung's integration of its consumer electronics and imaging businesses, the company announced on December 12th that it will be reflecting this in its organizational restructuring for the end of the year.
Through various services for home appliances and mobile phones, the goal is to strengthen user experience (Experience).
Samsung Electronics recently announced a new business division, DX, which integrates the CE and IM departments and consists of VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, and MX (Mobile eXperience).
Those related to Samsung Electronics described the name change as reflecting "mid- to long-term business structure and future vision, as well as global leadership enhancement".
We emphasized the idea that by providing products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment that reflect customer needs, we could create a delightful experience for consumers.
The successful launch of an integrated ship-of-the-company system, which transcended organizational boundaries and created a platform for synergy effects, was also the basis for the creation of differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is envisioning a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the seamless connection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones, based on the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Consortium.

Oginomamoru's Kin-Ku-Man review [Comics Chapter 4]. (Weekly Pure News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, has come to an end in Volume 4!
The first chapter was filled with tension as the match progressed from the opening ceremony to the decisive match. However, the new challenges that arose kept the story interesting and exciting!
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review by Oginamax ★★★★ (Star 5 out of 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the matches even begin!
This is a four-volume series of stories about a wrestling match between a giant red man and a small blue man wearing a mask. It was drawn in a detailed and orderly manner, so it couldn't have been just a single match. It must have been a series of matches, with each volume focusing on a different match.
We started from the basics and gradually improved our skills in teamwork, tactics, and formations. We also trained hard to create a unique and powerful atmosphere for the match. Despite all of this, there was no guarantee of victory.
As the tension in the air gradually builds up, the reader can feel the excitement of the upcoming battle in the story. This feeling of anticipation is sure to increase the tension of the reader and make them eager to find out what will happen next.
Thus, the important match was decided in the third place playoff between the Terryman and the Ramenman.
While eating gourmet sashimi, my friend suddenly shouted, "From now on, I'll be the boss!" in the backstage of the sumo wrestling arena.
He is trying to tease her by tickling her chest.
Unfortunately, the silent but powerful Tamamori stopped the terrifying man with his sword, and the scene changed suddenly.
This is the last chance to fight the powerful Kinnikuman inside the tournament. There is no other opportunity to challenge him.
Despite the fact that it is so difficult to find a suitable partner, I am still trying my best.
You won't be able to resist imagining a vibrant future when you see something like that!
It's surprising how much trouble a single character can cause, and now I'm getting a taste of what it's like to be a manga artist!
Although the fight between those two was short and ended without a break, the ring scene was filled with the tears of the loser after the match.
"You must not rely on only your own strength! Believe in the power of the gods!"
That is a lifelong struggle.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the reader, but it's still not enough for the protagonist, so he keeps pushing himself harder and harder until he finally succeeds. That's what I'm thinking.
By making this speech, the teacher was able to scold the students without using her hands.
Readers will ask, "Can a skinny guy like Kin Man really knock down a giant like Robby with just his strength?"
Why are you curious?
It seems like the teacher is trying to bind the student's imagination with her own creative vision, so that the student can create a work of art.
This was amazing!
I think this is the most important point of the whole story.

The Winter Illumination Event will be held at the Koyama Shrine in Fukui Prefecture on the weekend of December 17th and 18th. The event is sponsored by Fukui Broadcasting Corporation.
At the base of the tallest mountain in Tokyo, the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, the winter illumination is beginning for the first time. The garden is bathed in a beautiful light.
The illumination of winter, which started on November 26th, features a 20-meter-high Christmas tree and is decorated with pathways and flower beds, with 500,000 LED lights scattered throughout the area.
Visitors from Saga Prefecture have been coming to Fukuoka for a long time and have been surprised to find such a wonderful place.
They were talking happily about the beautiful scenery.
Illumination is a place to escape from the darkness and feel the healing energy. It was first planned for December 25th, 2019 and will be lit from 5 PM to 8 PM on weekends.
On the 25th day of the year, a Christmas event will be held, along with a dance performance of the Bottonkursu and a movie screening.

When we convey the deliciousness to viewers, they comment things like "The food was so delicious that it made my mouth water" and "The food was so delicious that it was the best thing I've ever tasted".
Is there a way to post the form data obtained on the same PHP page?
If there is any value in the form's <input> element, then POST it.
Such things are not worth doing, right?
I want to plant a cherry tree in my garden.
Kikyou is strong against the heat of summer, don't you think?
If the flowers in the spring have finished, then cut the stems of the plant by 10-15cm and dispose of the leaves.
Please enjoy watching the leaves growing from the roots of the plant.
Happy New Year!

How do people celebrate the New Year in Japan?
Please tell me.
Happy New Year!
It's so cute when they're in love! ❤️
This morning, unfortunate events have occurred.
We have lost the power supply for our NAS-use PC. 😭😭😭😭😭
This happened.
In the morning, open the window to let in the fresh air.
During power outage, the PC is not working.
2.) After a while, the pink rotator sound from the PC started to get on his nerves. So he shut it down immediately.
It is thought that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
He tried again to enter her room after he warmed it up.
3.) No action.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will flicker for a moment, but it will stop immediately.
After that, we didn't talk much.
Try again by unplugging the power plug just for a moment.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, and try to power on the computer without any other parts connected.
There have been rumors that PSU fans are responsible for the loud noise coming from the stadium.
Later, try it with an ATX power supply.
Wow!
If it's too bad, then...what can you do?
Let's change the case to the mother together…
Have you seen a wild boar recently (within the last 4-5 years)?

The popularity of emoji has been increasing significantly in Japan, and it has been reported that the emoji ranking has become a hot topic in the country.
The emoji with the highest usage rate is the crying face.
Emoticons are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there have been many applications and tools that allow users to express their emotions and feelings through emoticons instead of stamps.
Speed, simplicity, no reply needed, and no mess element.
In the modern age, the importance of soft atmosphere is emphasized by the necessity of emoticons!
Everyone is using cute emoticons these days.
Take a look at the top 10 most used emoticons around the world in 2021!
Positive and bright emoticons are ranking in widely.
According to the Unicode Consortium, 92% of the world's internet population uses emoji.
The first place is occupied by 5% of the total character usage!
Even though the laughing and crying emoticons are widely used, they are still hard to understand sometimes.
When it's interesting time, happy time will come naturally, right?
Even if you don't have time, you should at least try to be polite. Even if you don't have the energy, you should at least try to be considerate. People who are inconsiderate and rude even in difficult times will become fewer and fewer.
The person who used emoticons even once in the top 10 was a real rebel.
I want to try that style.

The men's volleyball team has qualified for the final match! / The men's fencing team has achieved a fourth-place finish and won a medal.
The Japanese team, led by Yoshihiro Nakamura, has advanced to the quarterfinals of the 29th Southeast Asian Games. The team's coach, Tsuyoshi Nakada, said, "We had a big goal in mind."
When I got the third set in a free-for-all challenge, I thought it was a fluke, but I ended up winning with a full set.
The Japanese fencing team will lose to the United States even if they win the medal.
I was thinking that the opponent from the quarterfinals was supposed to be of a different class than the one they were facing in the third-place match, but it turns out that it's the same opponent.
I would like to plant trees in my garden, but I don't know any good suggestions. Please tell me some good trees.

Thank you very much.
