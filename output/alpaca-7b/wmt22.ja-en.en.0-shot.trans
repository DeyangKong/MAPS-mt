I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was always on TV.
Yesterday, I was watching Netflix in Chirori, but it was so boring that even the staff started laughing behind me. There were too many scenes like that.
"It's so boring being a manga artist. I'm going to sell my manga and become a successful comedian instead!"
Even though the staff didn't laugh, the artist's bad attitude made the workplace unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and the attitude of the artists is too haughty. It's become difficult to eat there.
I can't help but feel sorry for the hardships that artists have to go through.
Even though income is not very much, I am trying to make a living as an artist. It is hard to make a living as an artist, but I am determined to reach the top of the toppest mountain.
There is a tendency for people to overlook the beautification and entertainment aspects of their own career and to focus too much on the criticism.
Although there are some difficult parts in the industry that you are working in, as an artist, you have to keep believing that it's all worth it.
You are so foolish.

I was so surprised when I received the wrong item I had ordered from the online store.
You are requested to send the wireless mouse you ordered and it will be replaced with a wired one if you wish to return it.
Even though it is troublesome to purchase a self-made PC, it is still worth considering since it is a famous place.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (including tax) at a tsukumo net shop (link to a fishing site) from the day before the gold festival.
Since the price of the same wireless version was the same as the price of the original version, I confirmed the price of the wireless version page as well and ordered it. There was no misconception since it was not the same price.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipment mail also arrived normally.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the customer from the order to delivery, I thought it was a wireless mouse at that time.
There was a problem from this store and it took several hours after shipment for the "registration error" email to come.
That's what the mail said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version that was being sold.
Since we are already sending wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse for an exchange or a refund.
Use the wireless mouse as it is.
Choose an appropriate response.
It appears that the product page of both the wireless and wired versions have been mixed up, so that the purchase history, mail and even the wireless version has been changed without notice. This is really unacceptable.
You bought the item and sent it to someone else without understanding the product, but they returned it and said it was too bad. Is it okay to send it back from here?
Please lend us your wisdom and help us to counterattack.

Even though the town was isolated by the typhoon and heavy rain, the only bridge leading to the town was flowing out. The residents had to stock up on food supplies three times as much. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa-machi, Kuma-gun, Fukushima-ken.
The great impact of the 8-person staying in the third-floor room in 2019 was the East Japan Typhoon.
Mr. Matsumoto san : "At first, it was a feeling of'magic'."
It was a very strange feeling when I saw the only road connecting the mountain village to the outside world, the Highland Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the same family were left stranded in a state of isolation.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's great that the bus can come all the way from the station to the garden. You can just get off the bus and start walking, or if you're feeling lazy you can just hold onto the handrail and walk across the bridge. It's so much better than taking the bus and dealing with the traffic and the hassle of finding a taxi. It's really nice that they built the bridge so quickly." One month after the bridge was completed, it was washed away by a sudden rainstorm. For three months, the village was once again in a state of isolation.
After two years of rebuilding from the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing his efforts to educate people about disaster prevention.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about buying 10 cases of beer.
We should ensure that people have enough to eat for at least two to three days. This could include canned goods, instant noodles, and other non-perishable food items, which could be supplemented by up to three times the amount compared to before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "I don't know when a disaster will strike me, so I'm trying to build up a little bit of a reserve and hope for the best." Meanwhile, Yamanashi-cho experienced an "unforeseen disaster" and Mr. Yamanashi shared his experience.
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to devise its own unique take on the matter.
The town of Shirakawa is planning to prepare for disasters on October 12th, the day of Shirakawa's Festival, in the form of a memorial event. They would like to consider what measures can be taken to equip themselves for disasters in the future.
Even though we have experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.
Article about buying things.
Although the test itself has almost finished, I still need to check the accuracy of the results. Please wait a bit more.
I will no longer be able to trust the results of measurements if I don't understand them properly.
If China had not hosted the Olympics, would the ranking of the Japanese athletes have changed?
I don't know.
Even if a hole appeared from China, it wouldn't be a problem. Even if a disaster appeared from China, it wouldn't be a problem.
The specifications for the Olympic Link are very fine, reaching even down to the level of illumination.
No matter where you go, you will eventually become the same.
Even if you go to different places, it's still the same.

When buying a used house, beware!
The hole caused by the collapse of the building status survey system (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
Towards the revitalization of the used housing market, a new system for inspecting building conditions has been set up. Used housing transactions have become popular.
The price of constructing a house and the cost of a mansion have both risJapanese: 彼女は、彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の彼女の��
As the number of people who are looking for a place to live increases due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the demand for affordable housing has grown significantly. This has caused a surge in popularity of “station-adjacent”, “station-near”, and “station-direct” properties, as well as “towers” which are represented by words such as “large”, “massive”, and “sky-high”.
Although existing (old) housing is still abundant in Japan, the existing (old) housing share in Japan is still low compared to overseas.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started an inspection of building conditions in 2018, with the aim of ensuring safe and secure used housing transactions. This inspection, which is called "Inspection" in English, was started by MLIT to check building conditions.
This is a system in which a skilled builder who has become proficient in the Japanese housing market checks the current condition and con dition of the building and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers when it comes to the introduction of inspe Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalA new public artwork has been unveiled at Antrim Area Hospital.The artwork, which is located in the hospital’s main entrance, was created by local artist, David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture made from steel and aluminium and is inspired by the hospital’s history and the surrounding landscape.The artwork was commissioned by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and was funded by the Department of Health.The artwork was unveiled by the Minister for Health, Simon Hamilton MLA, and the Chair of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, Jennifer Johnston.The Minister said: “I am delighted to be here today to unveil this wonderful new public artwork at Antrim Area Hospital. This sculpture is a beautiful and thoughtful addition to the hospital and I am sure it will be enjoyed by staff, patients and visitors
By conducting an inspection of the goods before the purchase and sale transaction, the merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning afterward and provide the buyer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been going on since ancient times.
Even if you are on the buying side, you can grasp the condition of used houses for purchase, and it is a system that can be beneficially purchased if you see it.
On the system of the current building inspection, the main responsibility for leading the inspection lies with the seller.
It is important to pay attention to the fact that the system of inspection and announcement has become obligatory at the point of adding and subtracting.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to inspect the building conditions when handling a property, but in practice, it is not obligatory.
Although there is a risk of being anxious in the inspection of the salesperson in Japan, overseas it is possible to switch one's gaze to the vibrant used car markets of America and the United Kingdom, where similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stages of a real estate transaction, the buyer typically hires specialists such as inspectors and building surveyors to conduct a building inspection before signing the contract.
For example, in the case of America, the inspection rate of used houses in the state is around 70 to 90%.
In terms of the point that "buyer's agent" is leading the inspection, the main difference between Japanese-style inspection and its nature is great.
The landlord can often be seen inspecting the condition of the building, even if only slightly, in order to raise the rent as early as possible.
We are considering moving to a place where we can feel safe and secure.
Even if we have the same goals and thoughts, there is still a chance of misunderstanding due to language barrier.
For this reason, risks such as anxiety and worry have been pointed out regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of inspection of the salesperson-customer relationship model determined by the country shall not be minimized.
Since detailed survey is not possible, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing customer cases and providing support to the customer is important.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the employer does not report unfavorable survey results to the labor authorities.

Is the Silver Zone an island?
Silver Brain: 5 Essential Academic Subjects for Leisurely Conversation (LEON.JP News) - Yahoo! News
This place used to be the ancient capital of Japan.
That's why it's a bit difficult to find a place to expose your own little bit of scholarly research in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square in Tokyo. It's quite interesting and entertaining.
Go up to the Silver Zone!?
He dived into the goldfish bowl.
As you walk through the Ginza district, you can see the changing of the winds, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shops that have been carved into the history of the place.
As she walked to the Silver Zone, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a profound silence. She realized that this place was the ancient ruins of a past civilization.
Is the Ginza district of Tokyo?
The nickname "Ginza" for the bustling shopping district in Tokyo has become a popular shorthand for luxury and fashion.
The Ginza, which is known as a silver coin factory, was moved from present-day Shizuoka City to Edo in 1612 (Kan'ei 17).
At that time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but eventually became known as "Ginza" due to its transfer to that location.
According to the news, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed through the area now known as Tokyo and the surrounding cities. During this period, the river was known as the "Edo River". A large island called "Edojima" extended from the Sumida River to the Tokyo Bay. This island was gradually extended as the Edo Period progressed, forming the present-day Tokyo.
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened a bakufu in Edo and buried the moat, and proceeded with the construction of the Kyobashi district.
We have to rebuild our homes and improve public infrastructure, and develop water transportation.
Thus, they dug up the earth and threw it away, and then they destroyed the Shimoda Mountain by cutting it down. Finally, they buried the river.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worth taking a look.
People know the Silver Zone as the "Holy Ground Pilgrimage".
Silver Zaka is known for its "Silver Zaka Hachimangu Shrine MEGURI" which is an annual ritual that is held to be blessed by the sacred site.
In the sacred grounds of a Shinto shrine, the most captivating sight is the Kabuki Theater in front of the "Kabuki-za" shrine.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki theatre.
One side, the "Lion King" statue is on the roof of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, the "Silver Pavement Deity" statue is on the 9th floor of the Tokyo Skytree.
The Shrines of the Kagura are located in the depths of the forest, hidden from view. The Shrine of the Kagura is known to have been respected by the Geisha of the pleasure quarters, and the Shrine of the Kagura is located in the basement of the Successful Kagura Shrine in Tokyo.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian spirits as well as the gods of the land and sea. However, most shrines only worship the gods of the harvest by offering rice and other crops as a sacrifice.
In front of the shrine, a fox would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the shrine was built with the hope of receiving the good fortune of a bountiful harvest.
As it has been transformed into a bustling metropolis like Kyoto and Edo, the benefits of commercial activities are becoming increasingly apparent. Not only in Japan's most prosperous city, Tokyo, but also in its vibrant shopping district, Ginza, faith is also widely practiced.

The Korean company Posco has acquired the Senegalese energy company Enagás, and is looking to expand its overseas gas business. This news was reported by the Korean media (WoW!Korea).
Posco International announced on November 12 that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement and an investment agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, aiming to invest in Senex Energy's acquisition of Hancock Energy.
Since there are still some procedures such as the approval of the host and local NGOs at the Senegal ENAJ International Conference, the purchase and sale procedures will be completed by March 2020.
In 2010, the acquisition of Posco by the Posco Group became the world's largest M&A case in the history of purchase and merger (M&A).
The total amount of purchase and sale was 7709 billion yen, with Posco International investing 50.1%, and Hancock Natural Resources investing 49.9%.

That pain in your knee, could it be "Chondromalacia Patellae"?
Different Treatment Methods According to Cause - Yahoo! News
The Editing Team has been suffering from a pain in the butt lately.
Is there a possibility of getting such a disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The pain of the knee joint may be caused by various things such as knee joint stiffness, ligamentous laxity, and overuse injuries.
In Japan, it is very common for people to have "joint laxity" or "joint hypermobility".
Is it possible that the editing team will be affected by the changes in the schedule?
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
Our job is to cover the soft tissues of the joints with a thin layer of cartilage, to absorb the impact of shock, and to make the movements of the joints smoothly.
Taking part in activities such as aging, overeating, and intense sports can cause the soft tissues to become weak and deformed.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Is the transformation joint disease also found outside the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Hey.
Even outside the elbow, there may be pain in the wrist, thumb, index finger, ankle, knee, and foot joints, as well as the shoulder, chest, and abdDescriptor.
Unfortunately, the most common case is a case of "Spondylolisthesis", which is a condition where a vertebra slides forward over the one below it.
Editing Team: What kind of structure does the joint have?
Mr. Maruyama: The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are elastic and able to move in a balanced way.
Therefore, the part that is covered by this 2-book is the "joint cartilage", and the surrounding area is covered by "joint capsule".
The editing team is complicated and structured.
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
There is a layer of lubricating tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule. It produces synovial fluid to lubricate the joint.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronate and condrocyte sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joints smoothly requires good sources of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms can occur if you have a transformation joint disorder?
Mr. Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of viscoelasticity, so it can act as a shock absorber and prevent direct contact between bones.
Iwaba is a role like that of a maid in a cafe.
Unfortunately, if you continue to strain yourself, it can cause joint deformity, inflammation, and pain.
Do you sleep in pajamas?
You can sleep in your basic pajamas, but it's more comfortable to change into something more comfortable, like a bathrobe, when you're in the middle of washing your pajamas.
Even if you smoke a hebi smoker, will the non-smoking people be able to stay?
There are two types.
I had a great time with the hebbie, but I had to stop suddenly.
Even if you don't have anything to do, you can still find something to do.

You can actually experience the thrill of "Kaiji" series in this real-sounding 3-player game (with sound).
Gambling manga series "Kaiji" centering on male characters which has become popular explosively.
There is a game with an extreme sense of purpose hidden in one of the flavors of the work.
[Picture] Just watching the feet move...... Challenging the bridge crossing!
Let's test the game of Kaji, which is actually playable in this place, or which is being practiced as a planning video.
The trap-filled Pachinko Parlor "Nu" appeared in the movie "Pachinko Breaking Bad".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the customers.
This "pond" has a large trap from the "Hedge Maze" and the "Moving Object" and the "3-Stage Culvert" which makes it almost impossible to infiltrate.
After using various kinds of tools such as a saw, a hammer, and a chisel, he finally lowered the stone slab and placed a wine barrel in the water tank beneath the building.
The character "Kai" from the anime "Kai-Ni-Pachi" has become popular and is now appearing in many arcades where people are playing the game.
Even though things like "One-Thousand-Yen Coins" and difficulty levels have been lowered, it is still possible to enjoy the atmosphere of collecting coins.
The "Star Side Party" held a cash prize for those who included a kai jin in their outfit, and the participants were ordered to do the Tetsubo-wari, or human horse racing, which is a part of the "Human Horse" event.
The debtors are struggling to stay on top of the thin, delicate steel bones installed on the ground, while they contrive their way forward and compete against each other's speed.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win the prize money, but the steel bones are only 4, which makes the safety measures insufficient and the death possibility quite high.
This bridge is very dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game and as a fan experience at the Tokyo Dome Gold Opening Iggles in Miyagi Prefecture, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi". You can have an extremely close experience by visiting the "Iggles Bridge".
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors) and is located at a steel-framed bridge at the end, which is called "Sky Bridge" and "Victory Bridge" is prepared to walk.
We are taking safety measures.
Corey Feldman, the comedic actor, has become a sensation in Japan after uploading a video of himself walking across the famous Tokyo Bridge, claiming it can be experienced in Japan through the "Tokyo Bridge Walking" challenge.
This is a two-player card game called "EKAARD".
Use the Emperor's card once, the citizen's card 8 times, and the slave's card once to make a total of 10 cards for each side. Play according to the Emperor's side, the slave's side.
This game is very popular and the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
Kayama is struggling with a harsh rule of "If you lose, you have to cut your own ears off" as he battles against the River Rats.
A device that can sense changes in blood pressure and body temperature, such as the feeling of an ear like an iPod, has been causing chaos by drastically reducing its own body to extreme values ​​such as disrupting the river.
The card is available in stores, such as Amazon, where it can be purchased.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, appeared in a movie as the character of Kai and challenged his opponent Eitaro in an epic battle. The video of their fight was quickly uploaded on YouTube and became a hot topic.
Do you want to try the flavor of the air?
No one wants to suffer from a misfortune like the one in the story, but reading comics can make you feel better.
Through playing the game, you can feel the world view.
Take a step towards the new year, and generously push the lucky god into the shrine at the Kagami Shrine in Yamagata.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Kagura Shrine (in the city of Yamagata). A giant ema featuring the Chinese zodiac animal of the upcoming year, the dog (Tora), has appeared there.
On November 11th, 11 students from Tohoku University of Art and Design went to the shrine and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting apprenticeship of the original paintings of ema from a craftsman since last year.
Nine students from the Art Course of Japan Painting, led by Prof. Mitsunori Aida, have been selected to be employed from the 9th year of the course. The selected work is by Yui Sasaki (22).
The giant horse is 3.3 meters wide and has a height of about 1.8 meters at the center.

I would like to continue living in Tama-no. I would like to propose a workshop for high school students in the city. The workshop will be held in the digital newspaper of the sun.
What kind of town was 2030's Yamanouchi?
The student representatives of four high schools in Tama City are discussing the idea of continuing to live in Tama at a workshop.
We are conducting a survey and policy proposal for the organization of "Tamano S.D.G.S. Miraluzuki Center" in order to take into account the voice of youth in the growth of the city.
What is funny in such a situation?
When the student was asked about the quality of the teacher's question, he answered, "When many people are working together, it will become successful" and "When the drum is beaten, it will sound good".
The first event was held at the Sunshine Ace Cafe on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and the locals discussed the themes of "Island" while moving around the "World Cafe" method. They considered "The fascinating town", "The livable town", and "The town to feel the life".
Each person's thoughts were written on a slip of paper and organized by folding and attaching it to a modeling clay.
A town with many young people is lively and interesting. There are many ways to get around, such as taking the train or bus.
We can't agree on anything, so let's just talk some more.
"I thought Tama-no-ha-tsumaranai, but it turns out that cycling the coast is full of charm," said Tama-no-sho-gakusei (18).
The third-year student of Kagami High School (18) said, "The store is too few, but the traffic is inconvenient. However, the natural abundance is nice." By talking with the adults, he was able to notice the regional issues not only the lack of stores and inconvenient traffic but also the charm of nature.
The second meeting of the month of December was only for high school students, and the contents of the proposals were organized.
We are planning to announce the mayor and the education chief in February 2021.
The mayor of the same-center is talking about "to foster the hometown love among high school students and to make them actively involved in the community".

The New Way to Find Stores (Nikkei Business) - Yahoo! News
You must not miss out on the store during the winter, but it is difficult to keep your head and neck warm at the same time.
It is difficult to adjust the balance when you look into the mirror, but there is a voice that you can hear.
When I thought there might be a secret store hidden somewhere, I was amazed to find a new thing.
The store of the brand "Cotto" (Kotori) is said to be around 1 meter long, making it more compact than the average store.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I make something this short and curvy?"
When you look at it closely, you can see that it is a piece of cloth that has been carefully cut and sewn into one piece. It has a net-like pattern all over.
The ends of the net are open so that stores can be accessed through them.
Even if you don't join hands, you can still tie each other up with a knot.
The fabric is very light and warm.
This year, the popular trend is to wear a sleeveless shirt (best) even though there is no sleeve on the shirt. However, many people are combining it with a jacket or coat to keep their arms warm.
If you have a store like this, it's definitely convenient.

Even though we were about to be scattered, we still had a few moments of laughter and joy. But it was all too short-lived, and soon it was time to say goodbye.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I was able to understand Paul and George's conversations! I was so surprised! Then, I started to talk slowly and carefully, and it felt like time was standing still. I was so amazed by this strange feeling!
It's so tiring to hear that kind of bickering all the time. But then, when I think about it, it's really not worth getting worked up over. It's just a waste of time and energy. That's why I try to stay positive and just keep working. That way, I can avoid getting into a bad mood and feeling down. That's what I think, anyway.

Everyone was amazed by their unique and wonderful performance.
Since the documentary also explains the director's intention, Peter Jackson must have been impressed by it...

In America, a large number of tornadoes have caused severe damage to crops and livestock, as well as cold weather. (Weather News - Yahoo! News)
A typhoon with multiple spiral arms has developed over the Americas South-east region from the 10th (Friday) night to the 11th (Saturday) night.
As a result of strong cold air from the south below, the atmospheric condition became very unstable and thick clouds developed rapidly.
A warm and muggy air mass from the Southwest has been pouring into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking temperatures.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Monday (9th) and Tuesday (10th).
In a place where the record-breaking warmth had settled, a strong cold air from the skies near 5500m below (-30°C) slowly sank, resulting in an active frontal system forming and developing into a chaotic cloud band advancing rapidly.
It was rumored that the dragon eggs were hatching one after another in the outskirts.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage decreases significantly during the summer and early fall.
The warning issued in one day of winter season has reached 150 times nearer than before. It was recorded in great amount.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States has reportedly received over 400 reports of tornadoes and strong winds in just 10 days (Friday) since the start of local time.
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the United States that are heavily concentrated along the southern and northern lines that extend from the state of Texas to the state of California. One area includes the state of California, and the other includes the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
In the EF Scale in Fukushima Prefecture, the strongest one is EF3, which is the third strongest. It reached 70m/s gust of wind from before and after the moment.
It is possible to be determined as EF4~5 by the survey from now on.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the situation of Japanese buildings, such as their damage and destruction, based on the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of JEF3 infection in America is high enough to cause considerable damage, such as the destruction of wooden buildings.

The voice of the world's largest ever recorded typhoon, Jebi, is being used to help victims in the disaster area. (Yahoo! News)
With regards to the typhoon damage in the U.S. Central and Southern states, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11th (Japanese time: November 12th), showed a remarkable performance of "shrouded in mystery" and "face reading" in order to demonstrate the "largest ever typhoon in U.S. history".
CNN and other American television networks reported it.
Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the loss of life.
The fear of death has surpassed 100 people.
In KenTucky State, where people were affected by the tornado, they had to carry ruined houses and furniture, such as household goods, for 10 nights and 11 days until the tornadoes stopped. In addition, at least 6 states, including KenTucky State, have exceeded 30 tornadoes.
The record of 219 miles (350 kilometers) of damage caused by the 1925 Mizoram cyclone in India and Myanmar is still left, but American meteorologist of CNN said it was about 250 miles (400 kilometers) and maximum scale.
In the wake of the devastating tornado in Kennett, Missouri, the Christmas shopping season was marred by a 24-hour state of emergency at the large factory, resulting in immense damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were gone.
A woman who was unable to move her legs due to the thickness of the darkness beneath the grave was feeling the weight of the rescuing officer as she searched for the grave above from her smartphone and facebook live broadcast.
In addition to the female announcer's plea for help, the sound of weeping and another female voice singing in a tremolo were heard during the live broadcast of "Happy Birthday to You".
An employee of a convenience store in Meifield, named Bruce, was hiding in the basement of his house along with his 5-year-old son after receiving a warning about the dragon's roar.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a fearsome sound like a low rumble of the ground.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how long it will take, how many months, or how many years it will take to find out. But we will continue our desperate rescue activities.
In Irino, Ibaraki Prefecture, a warehouse storing large amounts of internet and smartphone products collapsed, resulting in at least 6 deaths.
The shockwave from the train car being detached is causing the fences to shake and the roads to be blocked by overturned vehicles.
It is reported that over 40 million people in the US are without power due to the web media reports from Texas.

It is an old saying that approaches to evaluation systems of star charts are different from each other.
Other countries are claiming a reduction in their debt by reducing their number of stars to five from six, while Japan is claiming an increase in its debt by reducing its number of stars to three from four.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, and four stars are "deficient element" and "beautiful work".
If a work is judged based on five stars, then the best work is the one that is flawless in every aspect, and thus it will be the only work that can be presented in the system. However, since such a system has already been implemented, it is better to avoid giving bad ratings to the work by only giving three stars (negative ratings).

A colorful bounty of vegetables, carefully crafted into delicious takeout dishes at the specialty store "Hakobune".
"We want to make a restaurant where people can enjoy delicious food at a reasonable price," said Kikuchi Takayuki (39) and his wife, Yumi (38). The couple opened a restaurant in August last year.
One of the popular menu items at the convenience store is "Fresh Fish and Shrimp Flatbread" (1000 yen).
People sometimes buy nice things at the market.
"Freshness is the key to the flavor of bread crumbs. Ebi-fry is crunchy and direct in its flavor." (Kikuchi-san)
Vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, onions and potatoes are used to make a hearty meal of Hino Hikari rice from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are usually grown in a home garden and then sold at local markets.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Mr. Kagayaki adds a touch of color to the table with his French-style cooking, such as ratatouille and salads.

A family's long journey to protect the environment in China's rural areas has been featured in the Japanese media. (JBpress News) - Yahoo! News
(Katou Yasuyuki: Hong Kong Companies Find Asia Consultant) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, and the species of mammals that live there are the world's first, and the species of plants are the world's third.
Recognizing the value of biodiversity as a self-governing body, the self-governing body is not only engaging in environmental protection but also actively promoting environmental activities.
The province of Xishuangbanna (Western-sounding name: Sixty-four Towns) in the southwestern part of China is one of the regions in the country.
Siam Paran is a region located on the border of Laos and Myanmar, which is the starting point of the Tai (Tai) people and the Lue (Lue) people of the Kingdom of Thailand. It is a region where many minority ethnic groups live and work together.
The source of the Mekong River is flowing through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Saisiyat people (Southwestern Tai people) live in the Saisiyat Autonomous County of Taiwan. The area of Saisiyat is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wildlife and 20% of the species of plants in China.
This time, I visited Lixin Liu, the founder of the environmental protection activity in Shanghai, and had a talk with him about the contents of the activity.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together. They have been doing it for 20 years.
What was that noise?
Mr. Li has been leading our environmental protection activities, "Tenchō", since 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This place is the only tropical rainforest region in China, and it is proud of its abundant biological diversity.
Despite that, the economic growth was slowing down.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, we have been importing large amounts of rubber from China, which was in short supply due to the previous hot and rainy season.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
After that, I was married to the journalist and became friends with him.
Was Mr. Li interested in nature conservation before?
My father is from Shishapangma, but I have no interest in the significance and biodiversity of the mountain.
We have become accustomed to advancing the project without knowledge or experience.
Even though there is no special back, why do people look at the person with a high back?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.
In that moment of confidence, a miracle of nature is born.
That person is definitely confident in their ability and has a strong sense of self-belief.

I am thinking about the importance of spiritual care visitation nursing - today's visitation nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from dual-diagnosis, I have been undergoing long-term counseling and therapy. However, I am fortunate to have formed a strong bond with the visiting nurse who has been providing my care. She is very patient and has built a great relationship with me.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and dressings in the nursing care (such as wound care), it is more important for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which I found out in today's visiting nursing care.
Today, we had a discussion about gender differences and it was quite interesting. We laughed a lot.
Talking about sexual desire between men and women, or how she decided to get a divorce, or such interesting topics can be discussed in a visit to the nursing home.
Although I am wearing a skirt, I am still a man.
When the visiting nurse was unable to provide any practical assistance at the psychiatric hospital, she said, "This place is for medical treatment, so I can't help you."
I am using the social welfare system to visit a small visiting care station, but I am grateful for the kindness of the caregiver, who is treating me with respect despite my mental illness. I hope to find a good caregiver like Frank.
You are so beautiful.
Both those who have received psychiatric care and those who are considering it should be respected.
Visiting a nursing home is very meaningful for people with mental and physical illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.

The Japanese patent for water technology and the Chinese five-year plan for slowing down the economy have been leaked. (Central China News - Japanese Language Edition)
The Japanese government announced the hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 6000 electric vehicles in Japan and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of water was set to 6,000 yen per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
Unfortunately, the target of 27% fuel cell vehicles in the 2011 fiscal year has not been achieved yet. (Approximately 1700 units)
The percentage of hydrogen stations in Japan has reached 38% (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is almost the same as the load map announced at the time of the previous announcement.
It has been found that the load map of the water element economy is far below the target value.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) announced a report titled "The Current Situation and Policy Directions of Hydrogen Economy System" on December 12th.
According to reports, the core components and materials of the nuclear industry are mainly dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the lithium-ion battery of the automobile is carbon fiber from Toho (Japan), platinum catalyst from Kyocera (Japan), menburen film from DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA) etc.
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, are leading the world's hydrogen technology patent growth, with an average annual increase of 14% since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of water production and fuel cells in Japan (2014-2020), Korea is the fifth in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has been dominated by six countries, which is the "reality" that the Japanese government has been trying to hide.
The order of patent application filing in Japan, China, the United States, and Europe is China, the United States, Japan, and Europe.
Since China has been pulling away from the US in the year 2017, it has been widening the gap ever since.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) were ranked 4th and 10th respectively, but China's (4721 cases) 22% standard was the highest.
The Japanese government should specify the "National Strategic Technology" which is "Water Element Technology" in the budget for investment and development of the technology.
I have been waiting for two months since I had surgery to cut the tendons of my fingers.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the scar from the surgery is a bit itchy and the pain is constantly aggravating my hand.

Is it okay to ask for donations while doing volunteer work?
Volunteer work is not free, so it is important to be honest and sincere when doing it. Even though it may be difficult, a person must persevere.
There is also volunteer work to repay debts.

Is selling expensive items at a fixed price shop considered a crime?
The PS5 was sold out within minutes at the store.
This is the law.
If the price of a branded product increases due to competition, for example, the value of the product may become more scarce than before.
For example, when a renowned artist's work increases in value, it is considered to be the result of a fair market price.
The price of Ps5 is high, but it is still a rare and valuable item due to its high price.

The town assembly election is a three-term consecutive uninterrupted abstention from voting, in order to gain the attention of the townspeople.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine as part of a training mission for its troops (CNN.co.jp).
The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine reported on December 12th that weapons, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine as part of the assistance plan that was approved by the Ukrainian government.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million dollars (approximately 68 billion yen), and the last equipment item, such as a radar station for identifying launch sites of rocket attacks, is being transported to Ukraine.
According to the Cabinet Office of Japan, these weapons also included combat vehicles such as the "Javelin" anti-tank missile.
The purpose of Russia's military support for Ukraine is to strengthen its national defense capabilities in various ways, such as increasing its military power along the border.
The U.S. is warning Russia to keep its movements in the Pacific Ocean in check, and is negotiating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries as well as Ukraine to form a response in case Russia invades Ukraine.
The Baiden Great Leader visited Ukraine on September 1, 2019, and acknowledged the provision of weapons aid.
Military aid from the United States to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of approximately 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, resulting in a huge increase in aid to Ukraine.

The State of Florida sent troops to participate in the multinational training exercise in accordance with the plan for Ukraine support.
According to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of Japan, the European Union Special Forces are playing a major role in training and advising the Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of U.S. Special Forces deployed in Ukraine is still classified as a secret.
The summit meeting between the two leaders of the world's two most powerful nations, Russia and the United States, was held on November 7th, but the situation in Ukraine has become a source of tension between the two countries.

The LDP and Komeito are planning to raise the consumption tax in a stealthy manner by freezing the pre-tax payment system and cutting taxes for the wealthy. The DPJ and the Japanese Communist Party should take a firm stance against this!
The first special issue of Weekly Daiyamondo, published on December 18th, 2018, is about "Chatting with Family at the End of the Year and the Beginning of the Next".
This is a technique of sending and receiving gifts before and after a meeting.
In the discussion of the integration of consumption tax and corporate tax, it was reported that the 2022 Tax Reform Plan would be postponed. However, it is likely that pre-consumption tax will be restricted in the future.
How do the rules of etiquette change with different cultures?
The LDP will be holding a tax reduction meeting with the DPJ's Mr. Yukio Hatoyama and Mr. Seiji Maehara, the two members of the House of Representatives, in order to discuss ways to bridge the gap between the two parties and to promote beneficial tax cuts.
(Diamond Editing Department, Miyahara Keiichi)
We should consider the taxation of pre-emptive donations from the perspective of taxing the transfer of assets, and make a neutral tax system that takes into account the timing of asset transfers.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill announced by the party last year has caused a great stir throughout the entire society, from the wealthy to the middle class.
If we don't pay attention to the rules of continuity, we can easily change the continuity tax system into a huge increase in continuity tax. That's why.
The steel rule for taxing high-income earners is to reduce taxable wealth.
The pre-tax benefit of the strongest cut-rate gift has been widely utilized even though it is a small amount of money. This is because there are many homes with self-employed people in the three major metropolitan areas.
Discussion on the integration of the two types of taxes, namely, the consumption tax and the gift tax.
On December 10th, 2020, the 22nd Annual Tax Revision Committee released a draft of the tax reform plan, titled "Making Clear the Nature of Gift and Inheritance Taxes". The plan proposed a number of changes to the current tax system, such as clarifying the nature of gift and inheritance taxes, increasing the tax-free allowance, and introducing a new taxation system for inherited assets. The committee also stressed the importance of continuously reviewing the plan in order to ensure its effectiveness.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Audit, Mr. Kamiyama, were speaking.
Making full use of the timing of asset transfers and avoiding losses is the most important thing.
"What kind of problems are likely to arise due to the integration by unity?", and "What is the chance of survival of the pre-emptive alms-giving?"
Even if it is not possible to make a donation before death, it is possible to make a donation as a tax reduction measure. Cutting a large bequest is not a mistake.
How will the rules of succession tax and donation tax change specifically?

The team that won the first three games of the NFL season felt a variety of emotions, according to the players (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News).
This match, John's throw was caught by the Patterson's pass. It was only caught 3 times.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season when the Dallas Cowboys played the New York Giants in the infamous "Battle of the Boroughs" game. It was the second and last time the two teams met in the same season.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, the first running back to surpass 2000 yards in a season, dazzled the football world.
The Builders were defeated by the Simpson and the one-man RB Gym Blackstone in a weightlifting contest.
The reason for the maximum offensive of the Payton Rottweilers was the weather.

I threw the Endoson Token at the Pass but it failed.
At this race, Essex WR Stefon Diggs ran past the Endzone and became a free man. However, his eyes were not able to enter the arena.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from the outside of the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabriel Dumont. The pass was incomplete and Arlen Harris failed to reach the end zone, resulting in a failed attempt.
Brian had been working on the WRC Corral Building project for weeks, but when he saw the movement of the animals in the distance, he suddenly released the bees and reacted to the path.

If it's something you can't put down, like a book or a pair of shoes, you can't put it down even if it's a designer item like a Louis Vuitton bag.

It's nice to think that I'm growing into a mature adult.
I think Japan is great.
In Japan, it is.
There is no connection between the Gajin Wind and the Kanji.
It's better to talk early than to be silent all day, right? "Why do you keep quiet all the time?"
Why can't I just be a foreigner? I'm so tired of being so unhappy.
I'm so frustrated with the low probability of success. I can't even dream of success.
Although I had been living abroad, I still felt a sense of belonging to Japan. One day, I was walking in the street when a Japanese person suddenly shouted at me, "What are you doing here? Get out of here!" I was so shocked and confused. I had never experienced anything like this before.
If you appear to be a Westerner, there is no need to be concerned about having an evil spirit. Just be yourself and you will be fine.
If my friends were all European, I would be so embarrassed. I would be too shy to talk in English, so I would just keep quiet.
If you're friends with someone from Japan, they'll probably be really nice to you.
Although it is not an exceptional handling, it is better to be careful with it.
Even if you speak Japanese, you can't escape the rules of the country.
When I go back to my hometown, my white friend always serves me a higher glass of alcohol at a drinking party.
I think it's remarkable how Japanese people have developed their own unique customs and habits.

After studying the sword "Kamiwakaru Kodachi", I have become strong enough to fight in a battle.

Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been causing a stir among the youth. It is said to be full of "exciting" and "daring" content.
There is no battle in the story, even if it's read during the day or night. The popularity of the story has become dull.
Even though it took 2 years to complete the training to become a master of the same jump manga "One Piece", he was able to draw only with a brush and finish the rest joyfully.
There are many attractive things about the earth, such as its diversity of terrain. For example, some people are so attached to their hometown that they never want to leave.
After the main character, Burakawa Toshirō, completed his training with the sword of the exorcist, Kagemitsu Toshirō, he was ordered by the latter to seize the life of a certain person, who was trying to buy the life of his own. This was the beginning of the story.

"Sou-gintsu" (lit. "Demon Slayer Corps Entrance Examination Hopeful") Tsuchikage left the area near the Kagami-ike Pond and introduced the nearby shrine. (This is either a reference to the character's noble and generous nature or a shameless attempt at fan service.)
When the first contact between Shiro and Kagami happened, Shiro was told that he would do nothing and just stood there. Kagami then said that he was too slow in his judgement.
Even in the midst of fans, one can find endless conversations and laughter.
If she were to follow the demonic sister, there is a possibility that she will be forced to make a judgement in that moment.
Initiation and evolution from the imagination.
We went to the mountain in the fog, following the Dōjin no Mori no Chōjiro. We descended to the mountain's summit in the night, talking and laughing all the way.
Before entering the mountain to perform the ritual of purification, one must make sure to prepare the necessary tools such as an incense burner, a trap, and a shovel.
Despite the sharp smell of the dung beetle's excrement, which was handled by the human's hand, it became "the corrector of the protagonist".
Even though it was sudden, he was able to avoid the entire thing by raising his body strength suddenly!! It was his true nature as a demon.
Suddenly, people who were ordinary before gained tremendous strength and skill without noticing. When they wake up, they can use this power and skill naturally as if it was their own potential.
Those who have put in effort will be rewarded, but those who have not put in effort will not be rewarded. This is the principle of "effort equivalence exchange" which is based on superhuman strength and not on the foundation of humanity's praise. This rule is difficult to follow.

Samsumg Electronics has established a new "DX" department which emphasizes user experience, integrating home appliances and mobile devices. (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News)
Following the integration of Samsumg Electronics' CE and IM businesses, the company has decided to call it the DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect it in the organizational changes to be made by the end of the year. The announcement was made on the 12th.
Through various services available from mobile phones, users can strengthen their experience (Experience).
Samsumg Electronics has announced the integration of its CE and IM businesses to form a new DX business unit, which includes VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, MX (Mobile Experience), and Networking from various business units.
The person in charge of Samsumg Electronics explained, "This name change reflects our long-term business structure and future vision, as well as global leadership enhancement."
We emphasized the idea that by providing services and solutions that reflect customer needs and optimizing consumer experiences, we can enjoy a relaxed and pleasant shopping journey.
The launch of the unified leadership ship system was the impetus for creating a boundary-crossing synergy effect across the entire company, resulting in the creation of products and services that were both discriminated against and named after the strategy.
Samsumg Electronics is envisioning a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the seamless connection of home appliances and smartphones, based on the foundation of IoT and AI.
What is the difference between 1500BCE and before the Common Era?

Before Christ (BC) means before the birth of Christ, but it is also used to refer to a period of time before the birth of Christ by people who are not Christians. In recent years, the abbreviation BCE (Before Common Era) has become more common.
BCE stands for Before Common Era (Western Era).

A 24-car collision occurred in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The driver of the truck was uninjured, but he was charged with careless driving. (Television Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the operator of the truck involved in the accident in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, which involved 24 cars, was not injured and there was no evidence of negligence. It is believed that the accident was caused by carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Matsumoto City, and 12 people were injured in the accident.
The police first caused a traffic accident and arrested a 71-year-old man for suspicion of drunk driving. On the 12th, they sent the suspect, 54-year-old Noguchi Yoshikazu, for further investigation.
The suspect's truck continued to move forward despite the broken brakes after the accident, and the suspect lost consciousness immediately after the accident. We were able to confirm the suspect's strange behavior of losing consciousness.
Unfortunately, it has been revealed that the suspect in the Nishikawa case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching the suspect's home and investigating the current situation in detail.

Oginomamoru X no Kin'iro Manryuu [Comics da 4-gou Hen] - [Weekly Pure News] - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics began in Volume 3 and has now concluded in Volume 4!
The first chapter was filled with tension as the match progressed from the opening ceremony to the decisive match. However, the new challenges that arose kept the story interesting and exciting!
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review Submitter Name: OginumamaX (Star 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling Begins Even Before the Match Starts!
This four-volume series was drawn with great care and attention to detail, but it would be a shame if it ended here. Therefore, the author decided to draw a match on the ring, which was the climax of the story.
We started from the basics and gradually improved our skills in teamwork, tactics, and formations. We also trained hard to create a unique and powerful atmosphere for the match. Despite all of this, there was no guarantee of victory.
As the tension built up gradually in the middle of the story, the reader could feel the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming battle. This feeling was heightened even more by the author's skillful writing, making it seem as if the reader was truly part of the calculation.
Thus, the decisive match before the finals of the Teriyaki vs. Ramen Man tournament was held.
While I was looking for a luxurious snack as a battle card, my favorite lunch was waiting for me in the backstage of the arena. "From now on, I'll be the one who decides the winner!" he said with a smirk.

Unfortunately, the silent but powerful Tamamori stopped the terrifying man with his sword, and the scene changed suddenly.

It's amazing how much has changed since that time when we used to gather around the karuta table. Even I, as a manga artist, am feeling the pain of this sudden change!
Although the fight between those two was short, it still left a mark. The ring girl's tearful plea for lunch after the match was heartbreaking.
"You must not rely on only the strength of the gods' karma!!"
That is a lifelong struggle.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the reader, but it's still not enough for the protagonist, so he keeps pushing himself harder and harder until he finally succeeds. That's what I'm thinking.
By making this speech, the teacher was able to scold the students without using her hands.
Readers will ask, "Can a skinny guy like Kin Man really knock down a giant like Robby with just his strength?"
What are you doing? 」
It seems like the writer is trying to imagine what the future will look like, even though they can't see it. They are also trying to create something new and unique, just like their teacher who bound them with ropes.
This is a great thing to do.
I think this is the most important point of the whole story.

This morning's misfortune has…
We have lost the power supply for our NAS-use PC. 😭😭😭😭😭
That happened.
Open the window for the morning change of air.
This is the time for PC shutdown.
2.) After a while, the sound of a pink rooster from the PC was heard. It was quite interesting, so I shut down the PC immediately.
It is thought that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
I tried it again even though it didn't work the first time.
3.) No action.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will turn on for just one moment, then it will turn off immediately.
After that, we didn't talk much.
I tried plugging in the power plug again, but it didn't work.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, and try to power on the computer without any other parts connected.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles" from the past has been heard from the PSU fans recently, leading to suspicions that PSU is not the cause.
We will try to find an ATX power supply after the fact.

Recently, there have been many applications and tools that allow users to create stamps instead of using emoticons or emoji.
Spicy, simple, no reply needed, polite element.
In the modern age, the importance of soft atmosphere is emphasized by the necessity of emoticons!
Everyone is using cute emoticons these days.

The Fuller Brush Man is a 1988 American comedy film directed by Robert Altman and starring Michael Keaton. It is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by James Curtis. The film follows the story of a door-to-door Fuller Brush salesman in the 1950s. It was released to mixed reviews and was a box office flop.
