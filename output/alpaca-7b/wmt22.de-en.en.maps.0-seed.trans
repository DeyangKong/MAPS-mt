The item cost less than 20 Euro.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's retail price.
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and thus it is no problem for me.
I need only a number or an instruction to attach my package so that it can be tracked as a return to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs her 179€.
I find it very annoying.
Should I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price or is there another way of getting a refund?
I think it is generally not right to expect children to take on a parental role for their siblings.
Nevertheless, I think it is also good for big brothers and sisters to help out with the little ones in moderation.
Look quickly, help quickly, bring the bottle etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is occupied with something for a short time and it's OK for him, then that's good.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should have to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while dozing off.
It is probably questionable legally.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
If something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether it is a risk that you want to take is of course your own judgement ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer?
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by stuffing himself with food and going into the enclosure with his pet cats.
The case is taken over by a commissar who, after a short investigation, goes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissar has a small niece who is afraid of fire and will be sent to this therapist.
It leads to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired to be present at the scene of the suicide and to document it and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses their fear center and they ultimately succumb to their fear to the extreme.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death.)
This feeling of fear will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
There will be a great showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the rough plot I am sure the book was written by a French author / authoress in the original.
If this action is known to someone or if someone even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to first contact my husband.
It could take some time.
What steps must I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years, splinter under the nail.
Child, 4 years, has splinters of wood under the thumb nail (outside).
They tried to pull him with a pinch.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work out and it hurt.
When we try it, the child reacts hysterically.
No chance anymore.
We are going to the doctor tomorrow.

Due to the outbreak of Omikron: Johnson will push for a boosted vaccination.
The British government and science are dealing with ever-new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive the vaccine by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to progress faster with the Corona vaccine booster shots than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have already had the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their last vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
The target date was previously set to end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish regions can be accelerated.
Johnson said that mankind was faced with an emergency situation due to the Omikron variant, and that the vaccination rate must be urgently increased.
The good news is that the immunity level can be raised again with a third immunization dose.
"Let's get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of the Omikron virus were registered in Great Britain, thus increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone using pronouns.
I have sent in a job application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation was sent by email.
I will reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, his name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I have googled him/her and depending on where they have a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the email now.
Can someone help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to even step on a police officer's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should try to imagine themselves with Pronouns.
I have five books in total.
4 of them are going.
The one thing I bought today is not working.
It was obvious that the chair had a not visible defect at the sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
We first tried it on the #PRS_ORG#.
It has been working already for approximately.
14 days not anymore.
Therefore, I always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 more.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and have it billed to me.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I must write something from the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently due to my profession.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims are not able to help themselves or think that we cannot help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with four people, with the perpetrator far beyond the range of vision and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
I often wish I could help... in any case, I know I can't.
It will get better but it will never be easy.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
What does the Netflix series "Arcane" have to do with League of Legends?
There is a lot of fantasy, complicated names, and an amazing visual style in "Arcane", the series set in the "League of Legends" computer game universe, which recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited for the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick was Verlass on Youngsters.
Nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said that the team still had something of a grudge against their Pokal defeat in October, when they faced Hakro Merlins Crailsheim.
She then didn't lay down - but instead further increased her performance despite the 61:72 (28:38) - loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more was expected than the naked result, the art and manner of the appearance had disappointed.
As an example, a statistic is cited that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple-header rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick's response was: "We were not focused enough after our victory at Teneriffa and did not implement what we had trained for."
Thus moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "What a great game to win again against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in a crowd of 10,000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they had to pay for it.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best game manager I ever trained", praised Gleim still.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the entire line.
In the last quarter (22:15) they managed to prevent a total disaster and came within eight points of their opponents, after they had already trailed by 39 points.
Besides Patrick Johannes, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
The Riesen will already be hosting the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:19 PM), before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have sent them another reminder.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always called: Max Raabe will be 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with fresh interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on tour with the program "Good Morning, Lovely Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig.
Nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "due to governmental instructions" in order to contain the Corona virus.
Even other of his planned performances have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 years old, and his band (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then be able to make up for the concerts they had to postpone due to the Corona pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing and playing music since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene is impossible to ignore.
With the program "Good Morning, Dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we can check beforehand whether it matches the color scheme.
It still doesn't work, I can only long for the cover page but not to turn the page.
Federal Minister for Housing Klara Geywitz: Through Enteignment no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister for Construction and Urban Development Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as it has been demanded in the Berlin referendum.
"With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
When the situation did not calm down, Geywitz was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent freeze until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in overheated housing markets and the expansion of the rent ceiling.
I will be speaking with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite all efforts, we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners, emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to buy something and I realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process.

Do they know when it will be available again?
Will it come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I would uncheck it at the new order.
Thank you for the quick resolution!
When the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipment take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 people were killed by tornados in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has swept through the USA, causing numerous tornadoes.
It is feared that more than 100 people could have died in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several Tornados have caused severe destruction in the USA and may have claimed up to hundred lives.
The storms have left a roughly 320-kilometer-long path of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, "Everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone."
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Some parts of industrial plants and roofs are hidden in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this could be possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the vitrine #NAME# has sold out.
That is very sad.
Will it still be produced?
Is she completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you have to sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I please order the lid and have it shipped to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned the contact form and was wondering if it had arrived or been processed, since I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay immunization fees and change advertising slogans.
While the German government is rejecting proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money rewards for getting vaccinated.
By doing so, they are on the same page as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
Even the transformation of advertising slogans into "Stay safe - get vaccinated" - in the German style - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched to a new firm about which he has complained.
It does not make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year since.
He had evidently not stayed put at his old job and was looking for something new.
You can do it too.
And that he didn't like you then: no big deal.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the reservation.
This will then become legally relevant.
I finish a Screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Wow!
I am currently leading an adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual characters created and I am now writing the initial adventure and stumbling already during the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There they should unfold the further events.
Some miles from the village, the hero was supposed to be ambushed by a group of Goblins and lured into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group size: 8 normal goblins, 2 with arrows, 6 with bows and swords equipped.
Unaware of their presence, the Goblins lurk in the Holloway waiting to ambush the Heroes with three archers on either side, while two more stand in their way with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes surrender, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes were all rendered unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights intervenes and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight.
The carriage is still there, everything is superb.
How appropriate is Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much for a first adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I hadn't expected so many responses, especially not so many excellent suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas and now I also have more trust in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send her back.
Can you then come back with the receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I just sat there.
Here was the lower part, also known as the part with storage space damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space?
I am frustrated with Sky Sports F1.
Hello lovely F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been steadily decreasing throughout the season, so I thought I'd take a break with this post.
First, the transmission was interrupted midway through the F2 race in order to begin the F1 pre-race coverage punctually.
Although the delayed start and the crash had caused the time plan to be far behind the original plan, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It appears that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky Germany had no choice.
Despite being dumb, Sky UK has decided to end the race prematurely.
Despite that, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a great job commentating on the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was yet another rules misunderstanding by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they didn't know that one has to change the tires under a red flag.
Although there had been similar situations in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was only when Hamilton's team radioed that Verstappen should change his tires that they decided to act.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this opportunity was available for Verstappen.
I believe one should be familiar with such basic rules if one is commentating on a Pay-TV F1 channel.
It is not the first time a puzzle-solving game has been played, which now follows the rules or requires it, both of which have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, she doesn't like the artificial style of commenting of Roos, but it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition to constant foolishness, which both appear to be unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee with the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one is causing a lot of commotion in the comments, which he clearly doesn't take seriously.
Not only does advertising take over at Sky, but there is no escape from it during the run-off, as only German audio without commentary is available on F1TV after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF is doing it.
These two channels do not do as much advertising as Sky, and they are free-TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, it does not erase the drawbacks.
The rest of the programming on Sky Sports F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts the F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races they still have to broadcast, even without the commercials.
Unfortunately, the great Formula 1 season is not as enjoyable as it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the #PRS_ORG# Pendelleuchte, there is a metal frame and multicolored glass.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice but so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send the email and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already displayed a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I need your help.
Air pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate an air filtration system using an air pump.
This series will be offered in 3 variants by us.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can compare the performances here.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate an entire facility?
If you have a large aquarium, you should get pumps with two or more outlets, so that you can connect multiple water circulators.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets depending on the model, and they can also be used to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with a fan (available at our shop) or a decoration that creates air bubbles.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to name.
The MK-Series has a special soundproof construction, resulting in low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The fan is connected to the air duct by a flexible air hose 4/6 mm in diameter...and it's ready to go.
The fan should be level, or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the water level is lower than the pump, a check valve should be installed between the pump and the tank.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the ventilator between the two ends.
This would prevent it from happening if water were to run backwards through the pump, draining the basin...
If the fan should be installed outdoors, it should be, like other air pumps, covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK-Series are pure power packages, consuming little energy.
Even though we have indicated a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, the items are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to take precautions so that nobody gets upset, just because it took a bit longer than usual.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for the employees who also work in the logistics...of course, here the Corona virus has nothing to do with it.
Please don't rate the service immediately bad just because the delivery has been delayed, it is entirely the fault of the delivery services.
People like to swear about these services, even though we are saying...they have it really hard.
This is also very regionally different.
Let's all be kind to each other, stay healthy and hope for better times ahead.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrest?
Could one also order the legs here in white?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is sending his astronaut daughter and TV host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers embarked on a short space journey.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, wearing a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers slowly climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space flight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin didn't share how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed himself enthusiastically.
The astronaut would love to go back to space again, said the moderator.
New Shepard is capable of flying up to 100 km altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness, before it was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no universally accepted definition.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I find the subject quite interesting and engaging. I also find the laboratory work to be quite enjoyable (I have already completed my organic chemistry laboratory practical).
I had already inform myself about the job prospects before studying, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely keep studying until the PhD.
Currently, I am struggling with doubts, especially overwhelming me are the job prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) one always hears about amazing job opportunities and the profession is highly sought after, on the other side one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
That would really interest me:
What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What have you studied/ What kind of education have you had?
Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering whether to terminate my studies and pursue an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have experiences, write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Holiday & Weekend Days
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax from work.
Therefore, now a pole is needed.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
It appears there are extra days off before and after holid Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Civic CentreNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Civic CentreA new public artwork has been unveiled at the Civic Centre in Ballymena.The artwork, which is located outside the main entrance to the building, was created by local artist David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture of a tree, made from steel and aluminium, which is illuminated at night. It is intended to represent the natural beauty of the local area and to provide a focal point for the town.The artwork was funded by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and was installed by local company, McAuley Fabrications.Councillor Paul Reid, Chair of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Development Committee, said: “This is a wonderful addition to the Civic Centre and I am delighted to see it unveiled. The artwork is a beautiful representation of the natural beauty of the local area and I am sure it will be enjoyed
It was thus: Last week was Mary's Ascension, which is called "Ascension Day" in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses take a semi-official day off on Friday.
Last weekend there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
There were a lot of emails that had to be sent before the weekend, tasks here and there, everything had to be done before the long weekend.
Why... ja why?
Why does "then" after so much time sound wrong?
Why do people want to accomplish so much in a short week as if it were a normal week?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.

Why do we still have holidays if we don't get to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above; the colleagues were all quite independent in how they handled it.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?

Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian hometown - but has yet to buy any presents.
Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one can still go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get ready for the party by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
"I love it", said Catterfeld.
Until the thoughtful days, she still had a few things to do: "For the first time, I still had no gifts, I had to finally finish up."
NEKTON-Bio helps ensure a smooth moulting and feather renewal process.
Nekton-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio awards the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the feather damage that occurs in bird aviculture is due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of protein-rich material, a properly balanced and adequate protein diet is necessary for the formation of a flawless and durable feather coat.
Your daily diet should contain adequate vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in order to ensure a functioning metabolism.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during the moulting season are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or deficient vitamin and mineral supplementation.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While taking NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
Nekton-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through the drinking water or animal feed.
Thank you, I have found it.
It still doesn't work.
This is a DDR Handwork Model E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was in use in East Germany and Central Germany. It is very rare, and likely comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railroader magazine, issue 11/1968. It has been used and has some play and missing parts, but it is in good condition. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the schlesische network. It is possible that the kit also comes from the small-scale manufacturer Zschütschke and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being restored for operation.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2.200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to procure a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and eventually found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned until November 1952 to Germany.
It was determined at the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau that all six locomotives were fit for overhaul.
[4] As the need for electric locomotives for heavy freight transport increased with the progress of electrification in the mid-German network, three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the available E 04, E 44, and E 94 were preferred for construction in larger quantities.
When it became clear that the number of repairs on the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They arrived at the railway workshop in Halle P. in 1960.
They were usually hauled by coal trains from the Geiseltal to destinations such as Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives became problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that Schütze got stuck while performing health checks.
Then the Beimann, who had to travel constantly on this locomotive, had to unlock the shutter with a hammer and a wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and caused months-long failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new build locomotives available and no plans for a significant expansion of the electric operations. Therefore, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter gattungen, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to only have one-man crews for their electric locomotives, which would have caused problems for the driver's visibility and control of the train in poor visibility.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on October 5th, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives, except for E95 02, were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it in a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
She had belonged since then to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is on display at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being taken care of in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, with the transformers checked and five motors found to be operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their robust construction and minimal maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig and brought back to central Germany.
The main deployment area was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in OVP, Functioning well, Optical repairs to the loco may be necessary, Dusty, with Playmarks, Musty smell!!!, Very rare handcrafted model, Possibly from the small-run company Zschütschke and Bachmann.
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is being held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle balken is held by two feet, these are unfortunately defective.
The middle beam doesn't fit into the intended bracket.
I also receive new messages.
When will they be sent off?
No, not flat.
According to the instructions, the right parts were too narrow.
But that's okay.
Mainly they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat for me.
Could I please get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a substantial damage has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
According to police reports, two people were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not believe it was a deliberate act.
The police department in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
She eventually arrived much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur published a photo of himself getting his Corona vaccination.
Upon hearing that his friend was ill, he was moved to share it with Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him getting a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated.
In reality, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the social network "LinkedIn".
"My friends have been urging me to post a picture of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors."
So far he has refused it, as the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a breathing machine for three weeks.
His schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He had not asked any questions about the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Uğur Şahin from Deutsche Welle has been circulating on the internet, in which he says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," said Şahin then.
There is a prioritization of vaccinations in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been long since lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in the Substation: Thousands of People Without Power
In several towns in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases, also no heating.
A fire had disabled an electricity substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electricity substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhineland-Palatinate had to go without power for 24 hours.
Thousands of people had their lights go out on Friday evening due to a fire that affected 41,000 people in several communities.
Westnetz reported that numerous backup power sources had been in operation until the widespread outage was finally completely fixed late Saturday night.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered places of refuge in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their effort.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought about significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their untiring effort, stated Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technologies, in a statement Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would take several days, as the Westnetz-monteurs had to first put some lines back in operation provisionally.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company statements.
Electricity is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are expensive cleaning and repair works necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt power level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21.000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power back.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on at 21.30.
Since 11:15 PM, even the last ones affected by the power outage had no electricity.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner firms were involved.
The authorities also called for volunteer help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or isolated people and inform the local fire station when help is needed, as explained by Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the elderly people living in nursing homes were particularly focused on.
In addition, according to official reports, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical supervision.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the roof in Germany was sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euro?
It is about the sky in blue and green.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the subwoofer on the tabletop.
It is about a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 implementations of it.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155 cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, however I cannot squeeze it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return them, since they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback.
That is really easier!
Okay, let's do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now finished.
I had already tried it before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find a such low discount almost unbelievable.
We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins.
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to surrender to the dominant Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return the Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
We both made a fresh start and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it appears to be legit.
I want to open it, comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
They report the problem to the customer service when they recognize a file as possibly faulty.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now what?
I have to work in between!
In order to ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should wash the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry thoroughly.
Before you paint the brush with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the later not visible inner side of the components or on a Yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
The slight overlap of the color layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid quick, back and forth brushstrokes with the brush.
Through this type of representation, unrealistic areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and colors can be finished off with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal flakes when they are mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry overnight before you varnish them.
The models obtain their original look through the decals or stickers.
From flags on planes to ship names to decals on cars: Decals give models the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order, as long as the parts are still easy to reach.
A cockpit can be fitted or beefed up before it is inserted into the body of the plane.
More important than the right tool such as a knife, scissors and tweezers are when gluing patience, time and a steady hand.
Cut each individual decal out and lay it down carefully.
Decals are also known as Water Transfer Images, because you can quickly dampen their back side with water until the paper becomes dark.
Then you just peel off the picture from the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also pre-moistened).
While you are holding the decal in place with a tool, you are gently pulling the transfer paper away from the model.
Attention: Always check to make sure the picture is securely in place before you completely remove it from the paper, to prevent it from sticking to a finger, knitting, or tearing.
Excess water should be absorbed with a mop.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book for a few seconds as soon as I look away, then I can't read it and have to log out and log back in and search for the place I was reading from.
I have already communicated with you once before.
Can I get this by email?
Is it also for all 3 packages?
For the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me.
Thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back easily?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in infertility treatment for a while, but now that it's time to deal with the Statutory Health Insurance, it suddenly puts up a fight.
In order:
We had applied for the IVF cycle in advance and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was thus reimbursed by the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with IVF yet.
We applied again for cost coverage from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had more experiments than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 experiments (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 experiments.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first offer are lost.
The second desire for children should be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right to pay for the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the contract that a birth would have rendered the further attempts futile?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (resulting from blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could share their opinion.
Thanks already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants per email and tell me how I can reach them best again?
Everything is in order.
We will not be ordering anything from them anymore.
When they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address) they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass it on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague said to me that the repayment was initiated and now they are saying that I have to first send the thing back.
I can't do anything about it if the dresser is completely messed up when it arrives.
Can you please see what the colleague wrote in the Screenshot?
It is clear and evident that the repayment was initiated, and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two loyal customers.
My friend has also ordered diverse furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect appeared only after several months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal usage.
They are not allowed to sell it as a office chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty lasts 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will take the schrank apart and make it available to the transportation company.
Good day, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# series.
These products are being advertised with additional purchase incentives, which we unfortunately cannot find at your location.
Can they help?
The topic of the week: The best low budget films
A low-budget film is not easily defined, as there are no exact budget limits that apply to all films.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of lists of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What bothers you about it?
What do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
She wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will then give up soon, as it is simply not working here.
Hello
A half-victory against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU.
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs were however high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the conflict in a sustainable manner, according to a researcher at the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This tug-of-war situation - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The way the people at the border are treated is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong.
It appears as if there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by certain EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not take a firm stance against it, it will come at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens simultaneously the cohesion in the Union.
She apparently cannot prevail if a member state decides to go its own way, as is the case with Poland, which even refuses the EU border security agency Frontex access to its border.
In addition, the EU pays a price for its policy on the border with Belarus, as Bossong explains: A consensus on the Asylum policy will be harder to achieve, since the line "Border control, border control, border control" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again.
According to reports from Poland's Border Guard, migrants have attempted to illegally enter Poland from Belarus yet again.
55 migrants were apprehended in the night of Saturday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the authority on Sunday.
Polish officers were attacked near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants with stones.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically attended to by a military doctor.
The border police registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already managed to overcome the border controls by Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, of luring them with the promise of visa-free travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened to suspend the operating licenses of airlines that transport migrants and refugees to the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its power in the marketplace into the scales and has demonstrated its resolve to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared to accept that the security apparatus regularly herds thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has protested the controversial Formula 1 season finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 race in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspected of two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is being made against Max Verstappen's alleged breach of the rules at Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes's viewpoint, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-compliant manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was performed shortly after the conclusion of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had passed several cars ahead of him.
I am checking it.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the support.

I had then already a huge argument with you, when I ordered the #Presto# commode.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold out Blue Note on Friday and also moderated the event.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens attentively to the nocturnal sounds at her doorstep.
I have submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be, has my request been answered?
Not everyone has the time for your botched chat and cheaply delivered Chinese goods.
They have to fix their mistakes and not all from our household.
You can contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday that I (or Mrs. #NAME#) would receive an email with a 60 Euro gift card, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# Nightstand, and a return label.
This E-Mail has not arrived so far.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
With friendly greetings

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That is like when an anti-Semite says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither will they admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of antisemitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself then one should just leave it completely.
You're just as unserious as Kollegah.
Whoever seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply lost.
God has brought the whole thing into motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And thus you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal viewing field, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to enjoy a practically error- and color-free use of the Lupe all the way to the edge.
Loupes are often marked with magnification ratings.
These conditions only apply to exact specifications that are rarely the same as the general usage conditions.
In order to use your Lupe optimally, please take into consideration the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (See User Manual in the package).
Light reflections also appear on the lenses of all optical devices - even when there is a light strike.
Through the application of an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - a magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English languages).
Zeiss VisuCard Lupe = Magnifying Glass, Scheckkartenlupe = Credit Card Magnifying Glass, Vergrößerung = Enlargement, Taschenlupe = Handheld Magnifier, Leselupe = Reading Magnifier, Lesehilfe = Reading Aid
Whether as a reading aid for on the go or simply for everyday tasks: The Zeiss VisuCard is the ideal helper, as it can be taken anywhere due to its handy format.
And their hard outer shell makes them robust against special strains in old age.
Each Lupe comes with a check card holder for storage and safe transport.
They offer these parts, which you can see in the pictures or under "What do they offer?"
In what condition is the offered article?
Everyone can make a mistake once in a while, since no one is free from errors - if this happens, just send a message and it will be settled to everyone's satisfaction (either through exchange, partial refund or full refund).
You will receive an orderly bill.
It will be sent always, when not explicitly requested otherwise by the buyer, insured with tracking number via DHL!
Please deduct the individual shipping costs from the above shipping conditions.
There are no additional handling costs.
Everyone says they are authorized, how can I check it more precisely?
both email addresses are the same.
I will do very nice and good service, it took some time until one could talk to a person, they were super.
Hello beloved #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already registered with you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it used to be called something else.
You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: In the village of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even had to go home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
He plants there about 2000 trees every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says the Christmas season always makes things a bit more cheerful.
And with the discount?
Otherwise, I'll be a customer elsewhere!
Although I received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price for it, I am still satisfied.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to lead discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from tasty.
Problems with Glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly, receiving and sending 50 Mbit without any issues.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these speeds.
However, at the other end of the hallway, there is a WiFi module which is not sending out the full 500 anymore, but the further I get away from it (using a power outlet which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less it is sending out.
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was better than DLan, it also suffered similar large losses.
Could someone explain why so much Internet speed is lost over the power line?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to install LAN cables in that house.
I am really at the point of despair, so I created this extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted to receive an answer.
When is it time to switch the Giro account?
Who would have thought that there would be peace at the Giro accounts now, sees himself fooled.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases, negative interest rates have further eroded customers' deposit protection.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 Euros.
She has just halved her monthly allowance and even quartered her daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to €50,000 for Giro and investment accounts, and €25,000 for current accounts.
However, these lowered freebies are now applicable to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously lowered its limit to €50,000, which still applies, as well as for the ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB has reduced its free withdrawal limits in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
Despite this: More than 100 banks have according to the Internet portal Verivox already a free bonus of 25,000 Euro or less.
Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 Euros: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there between the bank and the consumer centers, which won the first instance court case against this regulation at the Landgericht Berlin.
Now banks are discussing whether they should set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and have to repay millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty team working for her.
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
Your life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who in 2021 caused a stir with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is mainly the result of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers are dedicated to perfecting your appearance.
At least, as Aniston says, she allows herself a chip every day (yes, that's right: a single chip from the bag).
That you are able to attract the hearts of both female and male fans equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she has bad luck with the good things - and still searching for the great love.
And he removed the baby wish from the list.
Before she was always asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked didn't have a clue what was going on with me personally, medically, why I couldn't.
It was really insulting.
Keep hoping that success and fame will make you happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42 year old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light tire rub, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport top-tier.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also gone to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand-Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and finished 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026, the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg said after winning two races in Winterberg in two days."
On Saturday, he fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by 50%, moving up from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material settings and raced on Sunday with 0.30 seconds of lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came third.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also notched his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who was competing for Stuttgart, came in second this time around, placing fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would also do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte brought home the third season win in the two-woman bob on the home track.
After coming in fourth the day before, she raced with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to a World Cup victory on Sunday.
Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen, who won the Olympic two-woman bobsled title, came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked both her Olympic qualification and her first podium finish of the season.
The Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is going with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot of work to be done elsewhere".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not entirely error-free journeys, but she said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the Decke in my shopping cart and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't cash it in, so I finally had to ask.
Due to Corona, I had different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had run out which made me very frustrated.
They were chatting about the Asare armchair.
I'd like to return it and then order it again, since it's currently on sale :)
Why will the shipping start on March 16th?
Nothing was mentioned on your website about long delivery times.
No, only when I press the button does an extra field with the message appear.
Your colleague took it away from you yesterday.
Why is it today a problem?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
However, we would still like to buy the dresser module, even a new unscathed one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have a lot of things I want to write about and maybe it will help the one or the other...
I am 24, have a part-time job, am a student and a dogmama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to the kindergarten, he is pretty much 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, has gotten a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the bathing (because his hand was in a bandage due to burns).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is feeling sick, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I gave him some warmth and cuddles.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now there's even more homework for us to do, which we'll have to divide up among us.
But cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) is currently doing very well, I am halfway through my therapy and am managing to cope.
Not good, but I'm managing okay and almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything, and on Saturday I have an Anatomy class, for which I should at least prepare something.
Next week I have a written exam on Tuesday, and then whatever comes up is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room for it.
My week is going like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then what happens?
Only until birthday.
There are only a few days left until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on eternally.
I believe I am just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors to keep myself from going overboard.
I feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't seem to do anything else...
Does it also go for you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly endlessy thankful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think it has something to do with the mental load that women often carry and that's why I thought I could find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today unfortunately it is the other color plus the surface is scratched and the table top has a print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to switch tables now, will I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on #DATE#.
In other words, twice.
She was not confirmed.
Nothing was the same: I noticed in school then that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you stand it?
You could also tell stories about your colleagues from work and school with different attitudes.
I generally understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the relativity theory.
What brings someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I would like to write in English as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would abandon it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help please with movie search.
Hello lovely people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the Modern (real) World.
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, he saw a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in the Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Realm of the Dead who is bringing the woman to this realm in order to be able to live.
I believe the crossing is also the soldier's grave.
I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other in the end.
If this message means something to you, I am grateful for every response.
Our Little One has only slept on the belly since Week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, go take a look, but don't watch too long, but keep an eye on everything.
That makes you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No Kissen.
Although we had no sleeping bag, we always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it get something up from the stomach?
Is it lying face first directly in the mattress?
You can infer whether everything is all right from this.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was a big change and a joy to be able to put the kids on their bellies to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" here and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20 Euro?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any response.
It's about my dresser, which arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the dresser.
I would please you to contact me quickly.
The chest is not currently available for use.
To make it completely clear.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I had fun with RBTV as well.
It's simply become the case that the politics of this station have gone completely haywire.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: He wanted to be "no running billboard".
What am I now?
A 0815 advertising sender, who tries to sell his BillMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They can obviously continue to insult the people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy entirely and tries to pass off the exploded rental rooms as ash.
How can one find everything good?
It's great when it suits you, I find it horrible.
I would like to return the item, as it has arrived defective.
Breach of corpus through damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.

Darmstadt is second in the Hinserie - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the decisive game, happiness in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt over the unsuccessful start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) could not be charged anymore through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power supply would be enough to operate the device.
Error, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore even with the plugged in power adapter.
Afterwards, I took apart the battery, but even here nothing happened.
Have you got any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in a network connection?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to receive the #PRS_ORG# delivery to my room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
We don't know how high the seat is.....
Are you often on tour but still carrying a lot of gear?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
This 20-liter capacity can swallow even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored with the padded FlexFold-Teiler.
And whatever else you need for everyday items, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment in the individualized interior.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The minimalistic design of the Peak Design Everyday Backpack series is a classic example of this - it has innovatively protected the interior of the backpack while still allowing for quick access to photography gear.
It works with two options: Either conventionally through the lid, which is secured with the MagLatch system, or with an excellent thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with messenger bags.
Inside the closure is a metal latch with matching brackets on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most other backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “fill levels”: there are four anchor points, sturdily riveted, to which the latch can be attached.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is more lightly loaded, you take a lower one.
The latches and hooks are also magnetic.
That way it is also possible to close the backpack securely without rattling the hook.
The second option differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other photography backpacks in a fundamental way: Besides the flap closure, there is also a side-release buckle on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to rummage through the contents anymore!
This clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you are carrying not only your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage as well.
With the Everyday Backpack you can customize the interior (more details below) and thus easily separate both items without any problems - and through the two side openings also access them independently.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday items stay securely in the left backpack pocket and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, adjustable shoulder straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof Nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it is going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# confirmed my appointment yesterday via email.
The shipping company announced it would contact the customer to arrange the return of the wrongly delivered table.
Until now I have not received any message.
I would like immediate settlement.
I have already been in contact with the third support staff member, with none of them did I get further than a promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is then to be seen when the chest could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for your help.
I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected was not something I could anticipate and I was unable to address and clarify it in a timely manner.
However, I as a customer do not accept this damage.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining objects in the water at the south branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing towns in the state.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, who is seeking wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You must simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that eventually works for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to obtain additional actions or to modify the rules in your favor.
By using these buildings and the dynamic bridge pieces, you can customize your gameplay with finer adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board, where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most Pioneers, it receives a ban!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players will take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the Pioneers return.
The Spinner rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on forever until the Announcer has moved five times, thus completely covering all locations and the year ends.
There is a shootout taking place, in which the players Coloma have to defend themselves against an attack by the angry bandits.
When the players have added enough Revolvermen to the posse and are numerically superior, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why Children Are Not Tyrannical. Documentary, ARD Mediathek.
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Will Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and their guardians are now leveling heavy accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never put their own power over the child!
Our aim must always be to provide the child with space for their development and to set the boundaries as large as possible in a way that is sensible and feasible.
It's still shaking me.
Holetschek: States are discussing the loss of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on their next meeting about the abolishment of the threefold testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated.
We need clarity as soon as possible whether and when thrice vaccinated people can be exempt from the testing obligation, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus for vaccination", said Holetschek.
The German Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to deliver a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the next day, Tuesday.
I will also send the lamp back.
How should I go there?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, however I cannot see how high the seat height is.
Can you help me further?
I can't process any more purchases through my #PRS_ORG.
Advertisement: Oops, there has been an error.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be attributed to?
What you are describing will be referred to as *Awareness*, which includes sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It most commonly occurs to hear sounds, rarely to see images and most rarely to feel pain.
This topic is relevant: C-sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as one must protect the child until the umbilical cord is completely cut off.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the Narcosis conversation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex had** no awareness **per definition.**
I misread her comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty rights.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check to see if they can at least take back the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose some money.
I sent you an email which you did not answer.
The question again.
The order and invoice specify that the item should be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, since I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book lying on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow goodbye to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading the news arrives that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common types of pallets are European pallets, which are standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was at around 79 million Euros.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually, is not raised.
New York has won the MLS Championship for the first time.
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.

Tips and Tricks for Rouladen
I had received here last week many excellent tips for the perfect goulash.
There was an abundance of it for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have become accustomed to the taste and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
I will set up a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going to continue?
What happened to the books or how can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'm still learning.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed via mail on 18.01. that the refund had been processed.
But to this day, my money has not been used.
Would you please check it?
Where there is still Christmas brisket in Lübeck.
For many people, Goose or Duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas Tree and presents.
Have they not yet bought any chicken?
Now time is short.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube preamp contributes significantly to the heat and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controls you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
The amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, allowing you to reduce the sound level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion.
It already sounded like it was possible to activate a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, if it ever got too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regulator, one can utilize the full potential of the VT+ Series in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a Line output.
This signal is processed with a boxing simulation so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
You can connect an AUX input to a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice recognition device.
If you purchase the VFS5 Footpedal, you can also conveniently trigger the sounds, adjust the volume, mute/unmute the effects, and change the tempo of the compatible effects using your feet.
This is essential for live action.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it at other places.
Is there any possibility to send the lamp back?
Does it hang too low for a dining table?
I would then like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update regarding the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would be happy with a refund or a gift certificate.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
If the item cost more than 1000 Euros, then it is definitely something I don't need.
I just received my shipment and would like to know if screws were included as part of the shipment.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hinge.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded.
Do you offer a Premium Customer Status?
Iran has seen progress in negotiations over an atomic agreement.
According to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, progress has been made in the talks on resuscitating the international nuclear deal.
Both sides are standing on the verge of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", since at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be discussed.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a week of interruption.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now the German federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen is the only German state that has exceeded the 1000 mark for Corona infections on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new cases of infection per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which always had the highest incidence nationwide, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but it was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, there were 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus infection and 16 additional deaths related to the disease within a day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday with intensive medical care.
There can be delays in reporting crime on weekends.
Furthermore, the Health Departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand it.
Since the delivery is expected to begin in March, it might take until then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the package and then give it to the post, right?
Do I have to click/select/fill anything else here?
I want to avoid that, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return to sender at my own cost.
I consider 8 euro Rücksendegebühr to be a fraud.
It is time for changes.
The German Bundestag has greeted me, I am here in Strasbourg in the Plenary Hall of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the post here?
When one looks at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one can observe that it is not existent.
We have gotten into a wintertime standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
What happened?
It is likely that the dissatisfaction is related to how things have gone here and how we stand in general.
In the last days, there has been a growing feeling that many people are still excited about the federal election.
What we need to change.
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking which one of them wants to keep it alive.
The spark came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of this project and found a, simply put, garbage heap.
After some back-and-forth writing, a few people from the community found each other and decided to revive the project.
However, I would also like to invite everyone once again to participate, so that this project can have a future existence.
We have created a Discussion platform in the form of a Discord server to exchange ideas and work on concrete tasks.
You can join the server by following this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten a few things, but it's not too bad, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a Lamp Shade from you, which still needs to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different hanging device from you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad over it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daybed #PRS_ORG#, do you have it in extra large, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee to me that the faulty wardrobe will be picked up soon.
And I beg you to do it now.
I haven't found a suitable packaging, but I'll try to take the shelf apart as far as possible for the pickup - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to arrange a pickup date.
Is there an instruction for the installation?
How much time did I have to decide whether to get them or return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, but now she eats meat only occasionally.
I was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought that by being a vegetarian I would be supporting the animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that there was a hint of displeasure on their side, but she defended the vegetarian lifestyle and said she knew where her meat came from and how vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm asking myself if my answer was too "plump".
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that vegans are quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without them wanting it to happen.
A harmonious loving vegan greets you with a loving smile.
It is not an exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not there on the assigned date to pick up my reports from #PRS_ORG.
Since I cannot be there due to a funeral, it cannot be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup time.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards, I will be available again.
The Lahnstein Fire Department has been equipped with a water rescue system: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 Euros for a new rescue vehicle for the Voluntary Fire Department of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 Euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rheinland-Pfalz is supporting us in this endeavor, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill tasks both above and below water in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they have come to expect increasing numbers of visitors: The boom of the hotel ship industry on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the continuously growing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, have contributed to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations however nothing has worked. I have uninstalled and reloaded the app NICHTS.
I am frustrated because the whole action has taken much time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and with the installed 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thanks first of all for taking the time to get involved, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar role, meaning we were both armourers in the executive, furthermore I do not wish to go into it any further!
I always find the question of rights and lefts to be very simplistically posed.
Generally, one should say that the state employee is more likely to come from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, people on the right of the political spectrum are attracted to uniforms and weapons carriers, as well as anyone who is clear that these people can not cope with the realities of life. This is also clear, because you have now in addition to the average white, many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I mean not the overly feminine stereotypical gay, but rather normal men and women who do not make it obvious when they tell them). And I can rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or set this for you.
Even though they may seem comical at first, my experience shows that they have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel alienated by overly-liberal policies, which they perceive as trying to help them but instead only making them feel singled out and not treated normally.
Back to the Right, since of course police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, which however openly express their opinion there or even openly plan state-threatening plans, which is overly exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have been on foreign deployments to start generalizing and making statements that are politically incorrect or controversial.
It is also possible that right-leaning like-minded people will meet and engage in an intellectual exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it will be successfully combatted and counteracted with educational and political measures!
Germany is so deeply internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I didn't understand it, so I also ordered it on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not yet sold out.
I placed my order in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# shopping basket for #NUMBER# euros to Germany or it is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only Sie as partner firm.
However, above the edge of the wooden part are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Is the child orderly?
Hello, I've been working on this for quite some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with little free time), but for my entire life I have had more difficulty than success in keeping my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which nothing happens, and then suddenly it catches me and I start cleaning and organizing.
However, it is actually never so that someone spontaneously comes to visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household just loses to work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Have you been able to become more orderly with your children?
We have not done it yet but have been working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
For me, there is no motivation to keep the place clean, it just doesn't bother me, as long as there is no visitors and the place is always neat and tidy.
When traveling with a child, is one in search of a larger incentive or do they remain lazy?
I am looking forward to your responses.
This exclusive, new, and high-quality cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and enables near-unrestricted movement.
Specialized pre-formation with further joint pruning for improved movement freedom (at the arm and knee).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area was more than doubled with the Flex System 2 in order to enhance the comfort further.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality forms in the lower back area and step ensure a tight, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility by adding a back release buckle and improves comfort, especially when bending and putting on/taking off equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and the back, guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Placed on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
A thin (2 mm) seamless face padding at the helmet increases comfort, as well as the sealing and durability (separate helmet).
A soft, flexible zone at the neckline improves the waterproofing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a gentle, kind-to-fabric hook-and-loop closure, which does not interfere with the lining or stitching.
Double-layered sleeves with a zippered closure at the arm and foot joints connect a detachable inner sleeve with a soft, cushioned neoprene outer sleeve.
The 45° fold at the end of the inner sleeve increases elasticity and strengthens the garment while wearing.
Long zipper at the neck with an elastic band reinforcement, for a anatomical cut with increased comfort without a hood.
Longer G-Lock P Rear Release Buckle (Without Hat) with Metal Slide and Integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Clothing fasteners at arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the recoil latches to prevent tearing if too much force is applied.
Neoprene Panels were glued together with external and internal overlapping.
The edges of the outer sleeves were lined with a broad strip, to make them suitable for greater loads.
The edges of the inner sleeves were cut to provide increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-computer models).
Can I pursue a career in social work with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I have completed a training in the field of Software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting again and studying social work.
The Problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
It means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a sachistic level, but it is difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told that I am unapproachable (though I think I have become better at it).
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather not work as a Streetworker or in an open youth meeting but rather in substance abuse counseling or family services.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS has already caused problems in my job (emotionally), as it downgrades me every time something is wrong with my code ("just simple things I've broken") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how it goes"/"I'm making a fool of myself with my questions"/"he must think I'm underqualified").
I will probably have problems in every job but I wanted to mention it here.
Did they get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for it.
I am waiting for a term for pickup.
Please give me back what they mean!
When I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message that your #PRS_ORG# has not authorized this book.
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my dresser.
The protein (Eiweiß) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its stomach and intestines into the individual amino acid building blocks (Aminosäuren). From these blocks the bird then builds its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather growth.
The feather formation of the nestling and the feather renewal of the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the organism as a whole.
Please note that Nekton-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the reproductive cycle.
Following the dose of NEKTON-Bio, one should switch back to a daily intake of NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral supplement).

1 teaspoon Nekton-Bio per 250 ml water or 40 grams soft food.
It is advisable to only prepare as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
A stricken measuring spoon (incorporated) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
At strong feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose will be administered until the feather-building process is completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be kept dry and away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is being sold as a office chair.
How can a office chair break down after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany last for 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and with pictures attached.
Have you received this E-Mail?
Statement of a Church Member in Conflict with the Constitution
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree should be felled on our property.
He also filed a petition with the municipality.
A worker wrote to me, saying that cutting down fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the regulations.
In the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the regulation is clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Naja, then I still have a sofa without usage.
Could you offer me a discount or a gift card?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euro and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you test it?
Emergency notification: serious traffic accident at Selb
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord interchange and Plößberg.
According to the police press alert (14:03), a car has been overtaken in the wrong lane and crashed.
There are injured people.
I understand.
Great, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career life.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is not going to be great, because my beloved head is currently destroying everything it can.
Before I start here now.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the recon as a quarterback.
I originally studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain anonymous, I won't specify any more details).
It was all too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
Eventually I landed a job as a teacher and was sure it was the one - even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I'm googling other job postings" place.
And it's only been half a year.
Before each painting I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can always turn back.
I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Although it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work to be done.
Before the exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then it was my weekend and my celebration evening.
I had free time.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moments.
Now it's too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures, which make me even more anxious.
In general, it is fun and from the outside it looks like the Ref is going well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am totally exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it hasn't already done so.
I'm asking myself if I want to keep on like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions -, or if I should rather go back to the old area, where I felt appreciated, had free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but adequately paid and in a team.
But then I ask myself whether I wouldn't be back at the same place a year later and unhappy.
You may notice that it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps you outsiders have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely finished and almost crying at the smallest thought.
I will not make my decisions now emotionally, which will likely lead to nothing good.
But maybe your views can help me to at least get a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for now.
Thanks for reading and apologizing for the weepy tone of my message.
I hope my situation has become at least a little bit clearer.
Since their introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, resulting in a combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" schematic, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We present the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps with a brand new Modeling Engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amplifiers contain, of course, the three-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This relies in part on real analog circuits, as these can capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this complex circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only gush out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even change and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you always imagined them to be.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
Since then, it has been refined several times in order to meet the increasing sound requirements, which resulted in a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was designed so that all guitarists will find the maximum sound variety they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the end piece determined the tube-like character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology accordingly.
The 12AX7-tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure panels, it can be adapted to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-frame reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two or three zoom lenses, and a built-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can still store a lot of accessories.
Those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photofriendly items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, since the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused immense damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has become the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest one on the Atlantic island off the West African coast.
There is no reliable data about earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has recently decreased, but volcanologists are still reluctant to make any predictions about when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-run TV station RTVE.
Damage in million-dollar range
In the three months since the eruption began, the hot lava has destroyed more than 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
About 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, with the damages estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses were created off the coast due to cooled lava, with a combined size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana production, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly affected by the volcanic eruption. Approximately half of the 85,000 inhabitants of the island depend on it either directly or indirectly, and it was already in a crisis before the eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas suffering significant damage, reported the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is standing at the door and the children can hardly wait for it.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the tingling suspense to create something alluring.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still manages to bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas gift-giving tradition, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "social contract" between primitive peoples, can be freed from the rigid routine and refilled with life.
How the Nikolaus became the Christkind.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days so closely with the gift-giving.
On the occasion of St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged either verbally or materially.
The background of this still popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have secretly dropped gold into three women's windows to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular German custom of filling shoes with gifts for children arose.
Protestants were offended by this practice, as they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther created the Christkind figure and thus initiated a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details so closely, it only angers a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas celebrations with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the Advent season.
Today, one can find shoes in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to highly desirable luxury watches, fulfilling everyone's desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving gifts on St. Nicholas' Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian-oriented countries, there is a cheerful hubbub about who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the region whether the Christkind or the Weihnachtsmann appears on Christmas Eve. The Weihnachtsmann is essentially a kind of Nikolaus who has acquired certain characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white drunken beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his slew, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus Child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has become quite famous.
Here there are not reindeer, but three horses that are pulling the slew.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

The police shot suspected bank robbers near the King's Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The Police informed that a caller had reported a man with a weapon had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by the police.
It is believed that shots were fired and the man was struck.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist attack.

Pill Problem
Hello lovely womenfolk,
I hope I did everything right, it is my first post on Reddit after a year.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago because I was experiencing unbearable pain during my period and terrible PMS symptoms before my period.
Now I would like to stay, because I have to take enough medications that I cannot simply choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten a two-year break from work and had picked up 100 explosive pimples all over my face.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
In the two years of pause, it never really normalized.
Someone might have some tips to avoid this situation in the future.
My cosmetics are already fragrance- and noise-free, but perhaps there is something I can recommend to someone.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to each and every one of you who took the time to read the novel!
The love of skin is so nice.
He had temporarily bad Neurodermitis, then a period of calm, then a large area of knots and the Acne issue.
I have tried various diets during my chronic illness and have settled on a sugar-free, milk-free, meat-free diet, as nothing else has worked as well.
It could also be that it's simply the worm in there, but if I have a construction site everywhere I'd rather not search any longer what else is wrong.
I had already given her all the information she needed.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What would I have to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe something is wrong.
But is he generally available in large?
He is available in black.

Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the receipt from the Order Number #NUMBER# to the given email address?
Can we discard the packaging material?
We have no possibilities to store these so long.
We would use the table as if it were theirs.
They had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. They had done so because they were so beautiful, and now they had ordered a chair in gray.
Must the dresser be completely disassembled for pickup and return to the store?
And when would be the delivery?
A 110-kV underground cable will be built in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The Government of Bavaria's Plan Approval Decision makes the way clear for the construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has shared it now.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the village and the existing 110-kV line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the overhead power line.
Good Morning
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue Betsellnumber #PRS_ORG# with the shippingnumber #NUMBER# was returned to #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is now definitely possible.
Can you tell me what happens next?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget it, I have already explained it several times!!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
My commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come in due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thanks for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the query is at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Referat: Planning of Instruction (EK)
Hello lovely colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer, and I enjoy it, but I currently have great difficulty planning my lessons in the subject of Earth Science in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can only use the board, a textbook, and a projector as my medium.
In school I can only copy software for free (which is annoying).
I need to plan my hours very carefully at the moment.
We are currently discussing the topic of GeoFactors and every hour is standing for itself.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need it for UBs etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I construct a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unsatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a Earth Science teacher can help me work efficiently with the book.
That would make me really happy.
I would like to please return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have decided to get a new one from #PRS_ORG# but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
The retail industry is concerned about the Christmas shopping season due to the 2G rule.
Most shops allow only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
He also had a possible solution ready.
According to the German Trade Association (HDE), 2G regulations will damage the Christmas business of the retail sector.
Complaints have been made about a decrease in sales of non-daily items, according to HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1100 merchants, more than 70 percent of them had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off their Christmas shopping.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year has now become a hole with no ground, said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions lost in the past week approximately one third of their pre-crisis sales.
It's going well only in the food retail sector and the online area.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Wearing a mask, maintaining a distance and following proper hygiene practices is a safe matter, said the main business executive.
"Shopping with 2G doesn't bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he emphasized.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required a high personnel expenditure.
He demanded that the Bundestag must approve the nationwide introduction of the Bands Regulation.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all shops with the given bandage that day.
In addition, in the retail sector - as has already been done in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should be random checks enough.
Even the shopping center-specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-COVID-19 level, with the sales at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping season, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts will be made to find solutions and to obtain approval for them.
This would include the so-called Band-Aid solution, where the visitors would have to present their 2G-proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to one found in a club hotel - would be able to freely enter all the shops.
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG and it has already been delivered.
The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which has been tried to be hidden with a yellow filler.
It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it into the package and glued it.
How do I need to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance construction, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is handled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
One of the special features of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lightbulb produces a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
In addition, they are also used in reporters' situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness almost without affecting the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working on a film set or in a studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is installed in hard to access places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
The user can adjust the brightness and color temperature of the panel via three settings.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply done by pressing longer on one of the storage buttons and finished.
The Memory Controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for operation with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, there is a value displayed in the two display windows (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the included power supply.
The construction of the searchlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm hose as an attachment, so you can directly connect it to your photostand.
The inclination can be reliably set using the leveling screws at both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components were of the highest quality and therefore designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a steering angle sensor is included in the delivery.
The included bag is great.
You can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might buy without any problems.
I was so disappointed when I gave her the gift and it was too small.
We wanted to throw a party: Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, it appeared that the recently winless Hessen were on their way to yet another Bundesliga defeat.
However, the SGE then turned it around, scoring five goals within an hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre season start. "It's insane what the boys have done today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN, speaking a "general praise" to each of them.
Initially, it looked like it would be another dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, who were still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What then happened, impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then returned and gave a fantastic performance", said Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who had been on the field for the first time since the fourth game and had overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and beamed with joy at the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner will now keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself in a good position regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we have all the players in top shape in December, that all the players are physically in a top formation.
Our medical department is doing top-notch work, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now one wanted to "step by step" continue and remain modest, and to complete the tasks until the end of the year "on this level".
Next up is an away game for Borussia Mönchengladbach in Manchester United's home stadium on Wednesday evening (18.30, Sky).
I am returning the package to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect the call, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent to me again immediately or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order has to be cancelled again?
For me, it would mean that I wouldn't order again since it has already taken too long.
Have they ever sat on the PRS_ORG chairs?
Damper for Handball women before Quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball team slunk away from the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after their humiliating defeat against Denmark.
The German national team suffered a heavy defeat in the final round of the World Championship, losing 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now face Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent", said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After losing their first match in the tournament, Germany finished Group III with 8 wins and 2 losses, finishing second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game that we have to delete, said Captain Emily Bölk.
To keep the dream alive of winning a first medal since 2007, a significant improvement is needed in the fight for the quarterfinals against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following day.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, who scored six goals.
"We were not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense", said midfielder Xenia Smits and urged: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not on the same level from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the kickoff.
Mistakes in the attack and technical errors in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on Standard Temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored a goal after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
The hoped-for ignition was not this, however.
The German women's team was unable to make much of an impact against the aggressive Danish defense - and when they did manage to create chances, they were usually foiled by Althea Reinhardt's strong play in the Danish goal.
The game ended in a 3:10 score after 20 minutes, as Mia Zschocke was shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals she can participate again.
The German handball team only started to play better in the final minutes of the first half, but by then it was already 5-0.
The already faint hope for a comeback after the switch was already gone after seven minutes with the score of 9:19.
The Green-Yellow Sparrows committed offenses in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a candidate for the medal at the end of the season.
In the following, the German team was unable to achieve a performance improvement and exited the tournament as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Time
In the spirit of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have acquired St. Nicholas' Day and use it as an opportunity to reflect on our family traditions during the Advent, Christmas, and Holiday season.
How was it then at home?
How is it with your\*his/her partner\*in?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
What is Stiefelputzen?
Do you want to bake cookies?
Do you want to decorate the tree?
Is music being played?
Is the gift from Santa, the Christkind, or is it from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone puts in the effort and goes the extra mile around Christmas to make it as beautiful as a family can.
Whether it is now firm traditions or even something different each year: tell us how it went in your family!
Could you please send me any transaction number... or else it might help.
Transfer Confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a gift code.
Just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does it work there?
The title is available, I am currently working as an immunization doctor in mobile immunization teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished, it will go on to the next part in the vaccination centers for me.
I answer questions without time limit regarding organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does it conflict with the vaccine?").
My area of responsibility includes informing people about vaccination, assessing the indication (person has a right to vaccination according to the CoronaVaccination Ordinance and no reasons to oppose it), documenting the medical records and, if necessary, providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The administration of vaccines can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical caregivers.
In vaccine teams, we often do not have pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but "only" (please, no lack of respect!) pharmaceutical technicians, who can not perform vaccinations (can not?). Therefore, I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Hoodlum" Question: Amberger knows the Solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This Amberger dialect word sent in by a viewer has caused much thoughtful reflection in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unrecognized by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "man, who is nervous".
And also none, "everything must go quickly".
People heard from the TV moderator that it was completely false.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused much astonishment among many Oberpfälzers.
The Houdler, as the viewers learned, is a rag used to wipe the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed it.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more widely known Mundart word "Houden".
Which closed a educational gap - even for many who have already been living in the area Amberg for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for the last two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message is received: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Is choosing tires for a road bike really so puncture-proof?
I woke up this morning full of determination to get some training in before I prepare for my bike tour next week.
I said, I did it and I cycled with my new racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then it happened, what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass shattered on the road.
Zach, loud squeaking and my rear tire refused to go any further.
Since I couldn't get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with half-hearted enthusiasm and take the first train home.
It wasn't quite as bad as it could have been, so it might be better to practice the bike ride beforehand by doing a wheel change.
Now I am standing before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have to cover a long distance over several days, I would really rather not get this problem again.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had given me the bike until 2 pm and had driven 120 km with it) were also suboptimal, since he had been riding them for years.
When I think about having to do a tire change after driving 80-90km, I'm really grumpy :D
I was talking to an older man at the train platform when he asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplatable.
Now it sounds very attractive.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't have the desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed later.
I'm still wondering: I think I'm pedalling my bike 25 times around the block.
There are some of them (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend another type of tire for my road bike?
The Schwalbe's page seems to be absolute! Do you recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and loving greetings!

After the release of our new High End Headphones B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO Series got some new recruits.
The new Solo 15 is called the sprout and visually reminiscent of the great predecessors with B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design includes a foot that is properly aligned to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the given circumstances at home.
Since the Solo 15 is designed for people who require a lower maximum volume, but still want an exceptional sound quality, it is very well suited for them.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate such high sound pressure levels as those produced by a subwoofer.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Contrary to this, she appears impressively mature and strikingly impressive for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone increase.
This is generally common at broadband providers to optimize the increasingly high frequencies for better bundling.
The SOLO 15 is very accurately aimed at the listening spot, delivering a clear and fine sound.
By slightly turning the sound field outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image made warmer.
Thanks to the point-source, the location of each component of a piece of music can be pinpointed with remarkable accuracy.
The suspicious low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM generate an enemy dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 not only adds to our SOLO Series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to consider the final optical appearance of the speaker at the beginning of the build, in order to plan appropriate changes accordingly.
If one wants to, for example, furnish the housing, then the lowering of the speaker has to be adjusted accordingly, as it adds more material.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to easily run the cable through it later.
With the help of an overhead console, the speaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed laterally.
This opening should be faced with a 45° phase in order to maximize the interior opening area of the speaker chassis.
The four screw connection points of B 100 - 6 OHM will receive a break in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
These will now be glued to the back, the lid, the front, and the floor.
Here, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The reinforcements can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example, by using prefabricated frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, namely the two sides, as well as the front.
Through the use of a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex port, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to smooth out all the edges of the actual box.
Even the top of the footrest can be rounded off with it.
In the following step, the bottom plate is glued firmly to the bottom of the housing and additionally secured with long wood screws.
Then follows the marking and drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the connection points of the speaker chassis and the power cable.
After the casing was cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
During this process, the entire and uncut cable is fed through the 8 mm drill hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, and is then allowed to hang out approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there.
Following, the frequency switch will be prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be obtained from the following document: Installation Manual Solo 15.
After the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is tightened, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet complete, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the insulation accordingly.
Now follows the dimming according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity is important, so that the + lead (marked cable) must be connected to the + pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is trimmed to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To increase damping, a piece of the damping material is cut into two parts and scattered loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I cancel an order and have it delivered in June instead?
Hello to all
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
It is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which explains the higher planning effort and the short notice of the announcement.
However: There will be at least three people there, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start about 0:30.
Get ready for an interesting night by making some cold drinks, planning good food, and preparing yourself for a long but exciting night.
