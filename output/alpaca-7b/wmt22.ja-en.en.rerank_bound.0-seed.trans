I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was so popular on TV.
Yesterday, I watched Chirori with my staff members. Although it was not very interesting, my staff members started laughing out loud at some parts of the movie. It was quite amusing.
It's not funny when people are trying to sell things. But it's really amusing when they're just talking. That's why I always laugh when I see a salesperson trying to be funny. It's not their fault if it doesn't work out.
Even if the staff don't laugh, it's still not fun to be around when the atmosphere is so tense and unpleasant.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it's become too commercialized and the egos of some artists are getting in the way. It's too bad because it used to be so cool.
I can't help but feel sorry for the hardships of being a creator when I hear stories of other creators struggling with their own work. It's really sad how much it happens.
Even though income is not very much, I am trying to make a living as an artist. It is difficult to make a living as an artist, but I am determined to reach the top of the toppest point.
There is a tendency for people to overlook the beautification and entertainment aspects of their own career and to focus too much on the criticism.
Although there are some difficult parts in the industry that you are working in, as an artist, you have to keep believing that it's all worth it.
You are so foolish.
I felt so bad when I couldn't go out because I was too tired.

I exchanged the products I purchased from the convenience store without hesitation.
The store promised to send a wireless mouse when I ordered it, but instead it sent a wired one. They said they would refund me if I wanted to return it.
The topic of self-made PCs has become quite popular recently, but it seems to cause some trouble. However, it's still worth considering as there are many renowned stores offering great deals.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse for 3,280 yen (including tax) was on sale at a tsukumo net shop on the day of the tsukumo sale.
Since the price of the same product with and without the wireless version was the same, I checked the price of the wireless version page as well and it was 5,071 yen (the link is to the Squidward page). There was no misprice, so I ordered it.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipment mail also arrived normally.
The name "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order to delivery, I thought the wirelessly delivered mouse would arrive at that moment.
From here it became a problem, and after several hours of shipment, I received an email saying "There was an error in product registration".
That's what the mail said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version.
Since we are already sending wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse and get a refund.
Use the wireless mouse as it is.
Choose an appropriate response.
It is noticed that the product page of the wireless and wired version have been mixed up, and the purchase records, email, and even the wireless version have been changed to the wired version without any reason.
Did you understand the product you bought is different from the one you sent back? If you want to return it, can you get your money back from here?
Please lend me your wisdom so that I can repay the debt and launch a counterattack.

The only bridge out of the area due to the typhoon and heavy rain was washed away by the flood. The residents had to stock up food supplies three times as much. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa-machi, Kuma-gun, Fukushima-ken.
The great impact of the 8-person sleeping arrangement in the third-floor room was felt in 2019's East Japan Typhoon.
Mr. Matsumoto san : "At first, it was a feeling of'magic'."
It was a very strange feeling when I saw the only road connecting the mountain village to the outside world, the Highland Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the same family were left stranded in a state of isolation.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "It's great that the bus can come all the way from the station to the garden. You can just get off the bus and start walking, or if you're feeling lazy you can just hold onto the handrail and walk across the bridge. It's so much better than taking the bus and dealing with the traffic and the hassle of finding a taxi. It's really nice that they built the bridge so quickly." One month after the bridge was completed, it was washed away by a sudden rainstorm. For three months, the village was once again in a state of isolation.
After two years of rebuilding from the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing his efforts to educate people about disaster prevention.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about whether there is 10 cases or not.
We should secure enough food for two to three days, such as canned goods and instant noodles, to be prepared for any emergency.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "We don't know when disaster will strike, so it's important to have a little bit of emergency supplies and prepare for the worst. That's what I've been doing since the bridge was washed away." Meanwhile, Yamanashi-cho experienced an "unexpected disaster" and Mr. Yamanashi shared his story.
In order to never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to develop its own unique take on the matter.
The town of Kagami is going to hold an event called "Disaster Prevention Day" on October 12th in the future. We would like to think about what kind of preparations we can make for disaster prevention on that day.
Even though we have already experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.

Experience the Paralympic Games in Virtual Reality (Tokyo MX - Yahoo! News)
Tokyo City will be able to hold a marathon race recreated digitally as a Paralympic event in 2021.
This event has been created to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo through digital means.
There were running machines and road bikes prepared at the venue, and people who visited the venue were able to recreate a marathon course in a virtual space by attaching special equipment.
Each tablet showing a virtual space will have an avatar of the participant appear, allowing for an experience of running a marathon while competing with participants from both inside and outside of Japan. Furthermore, it will be possible to enjoy sightseeing at popular tourist spots in the city.
Participants were amazed by the beautiful scenery which changed so suddenly.
The Tokyo Marathon was a great experience. I enjoyed running through the city streets while taking in the sights and sounds. I especially enjoyed the atmosphere of the race, with people cheering and encouraging each other as we ran. I'm looking forward to participating in more marathons in the future, including ones outside of Tokyo. The Tokyo Marathon organizer also expressed their wish to build a sports stadium in the future so that people can continue to enjoy running and competing in marathons.

When buying a used house, be careful!
The hole caused by the collapse of the building status survey system (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
Towards the revitalization of the used housing market, a new system for "Building Condition Survey" has been set up. Used housing transactions have become popular.
The price of constructing a house and the market for refurbishment are both increasing.
As the number of people who are looking for a place to live increases due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the demand for affordable housing has grown significantly. This has caused a surge in popularity of “station-adjacent”, “station-near”, and “station-direct” properties, as well as “towers” which are represented by words such as “large”, “massive”, and “sky-high”.
Although existing (used) housing share in Japan is still low in comparison with overseas, it is gradually increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started the Building Condition Survey, which is aimed at ensuring safe and secure used houses, in 2018 (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a builder who has become skilled in residential construction checks the current situation and condition of the building, including its deterioration, and presents it to the prospective buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers with the introduction of inspections.
By conducting an inspection of the property before engaging in the transaction, the merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning afterward and provide the customer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been increasing due to the competitive nature of society.
Even if you are on the buying side, it is possible to grasp the condition of used houses for purchase, and it is possible to purchase them at a reasonable price with this system. It is a system that is beneficial to see.
On the system of the current building inspection, the principal responsibility for guidance lies with the seller.
It is important to pay attention to the fact that the notification of the inspection system has become obligatory at the point.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to inspect the building conditions when needed, but the actual implementation is not obligated.
Although there is a risk of being nervous during the inspection of the salesperson in Japan, overseas it is possible to find a vibrant used car market in America and other countries where similar systems have been set up already.
Before engaging in the process of buying or selling a house, the buyer usually hires a specialist such as an inspector or building surveyor to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the case of America, the percentage of inspections for used houses in the states ranges from 70 to 90%.
In terms of the point where the "buyer" is leading the inspection, the "seller" is the main type of Japanese inspection and its nature is quite different from the "seller" led inspection in other countries.
The owner of the building can often be seen inspecting the condition of the building, even if only slightly, in order to raise its value and sell it quickly.
We are considering moving to a place where the landlord is kind and willing to cooperate with us in terms of survey.
Even if it is the same inspection, it can cause trouble if both parties have different goals and expectations.
For this reason, risks such as anxiety have been pointed out regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of inspection of the salesperson-customer relationship model determined by the country shall not be minimized.
Since detailed survey is not possible, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing the customer's case to the third party (selling agent) is effective.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the company does not report unfavorable survey results to the customer.

Is the Silver Zone an island?
Silver Brain: 5 Essential Academic Subjects for Leisurely Conversation (LEON.JP News) - Yahoo! News
This place was a peninsula in the past.
Even if you don't understand the complicated academic stuff around that, you can still show off a bit in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square Bean in Tokyo. It's quite interesting and you might want to talk about it with someone.
Go up to the Silver Zone!?
He entered the room for the first time.
As you walk through the Ginza district, you can find mysterious stone monuments, numerous temples, and a history of the area carved in stone.
As she walked through the streets of Tokyo, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a profound silence. She realized that she had stumbled upon an ancient ruin from the past.
Was the Silver Zone the Hakatsume Peninsula?
The nickname "Ginza" for the bustling city in Japan is popular not only in Tokyo, but also in other cities such as Osaka and Fukuoka.
The Silver Mine, which was known as "Ginza" in the Edo period, was moved to present-day Tokyo from Shimotsuma in 1612 (Kenkyuu 17).
At that time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but eventually became known as "Ginza" due to its transfer to that location.
According to the locals, a "peninsula" suddenly appeared near the Ginza district which jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed from the east and the area within the circle was filled with water. This area was known as "Edojima" and extended from the Sumida River to the Ginza.
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened a bakufu in Edo and buried the moat, thus beginning the construction of the Kyobashi district.
We have been repairing and developing the port infrastructure in order to promote water transportation. We have also been leveling the riverbanks to facilitate the development of the local economy.
Thus, they dug up the earth and threw it away, and then they razed the Shimoda Mountain. As a result, they filled in the river and built a castle there.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store on Ginza 2-7 (Central Ginza), there is a stone monument indicating the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worth taking a look.
People know the "Holy Pilgrimage" of the Silver Zone in Ginza.
Silver Zone is a place where the "Silver Zone Hachiman Shrine MEGURI" is held annually. This is a sacred ritual to worship the shrine.
In the sacred grounds of a Shinto shrine, the most captivating sight is the Kabuki Theater in front of the "Kabuki-za" shrine.
There are not many people who visit the shrine located on the right side of the stage of the Kabuki theatre.
One side, the "Lucent Shrine" is in the lobby of the Ginza Matsuya, while the "Ginza Subterranean Shrine" is located in the Ginza 3-chome 9th floor lobby of the Ginza Terrace.
The shrines "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" and "Atsukamori Inari Shrine" are located in a corner of the street, but "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" is famous for being respected by the Geisha and the actor Nakamura Kanzaburō. The shrine "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" is located in the basement of the building "Shochiku Inarimachi Building" and is not open to the public. The shrine "Tsuchigumo Inari Shrine" is located in the vicinity of the shrine "Torii Inari Shrine" other than that.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian spirits as well as the gods of the land and mountains. However, most shrines only worship the gods of harvest by offering rice and other agricultural products.
In front of the shrine, a fox would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the shrine was built with the hope of receiving the good fortune of a bountiful harvest.
As it has been transformed into a bustling metropolis like Kyoto and Edo, the benefits of commercial activities are becoming increasingly apparent. Not only in Japan's most prosperous city, Tokyo, but also in its vibrant shopping district, Ginza, faith is also widely practiced.

The Korean company Posco has acquired the Senegalese energy company Enagás, and is looking to expand its overseas gas business. This news was reported by the Korean media (WoW!Korea).
Posco International announced on November 12 that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement and an investment agreement with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, aiming to acquire a stake in the two companies.
Due to the fact that various procedures such as the consent of the host company and local NGOs are still pending at the Senex Enagic Corporation's Annual General Meeting, the purchase and sale procedures are expected to be completed by March 2021.
In 2010, the acquisition of Posco by the Posco Group became the world's largest M&A case in the history of purchase and merger (M&A).
The total amount of purchase and sale was 7709 billion yen, with Posco International investing 50.1%, and Hancock Natural Resources investing 49.9%.
Posco International announced that the demand for natural gas is continuously increasing in the Energy Transition Age and that hydrogen is becoming an important element in the hydrogen market, and explained that they have decided to purchase in this context.
Posco International will secure 802Bcf of natural gas storage and 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in Korea through this purchase. Furthermore, it will also secure local human resources for land-based gas fields.

That pain in your knee, could it be "Chondromalacia Patellae"?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC - Yahoo! News)
The Editing Department: We have been suffering from pain in the knee recently.
Is there a possibility of getting such a disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of the pain in the knee joint can be various, such as patellar tendinitis, joint inflammation, and overuse injuries.
In Japan, it is very common for people to have "joint contracture disorder".
Is the editing team worried about the changes in the joints?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Our original purpose is to cover the surface of the joints with soft tissue in order to absorb the impact and to make the movements of the joints smoothly.
Taking part in activities such as aging, overeating, and strenuous sports can cause the soft tissues to become loose and deformed.
As a result, it can cause joint deformities and inflammations.
Is the transformation joint disorder limited to the knee only or can it also manifest elsewhere?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Even outside the knee, there are joints and tendons of the fingers, wrist, elbow, rib cage, hip, and ankle which can cause pain.
However, the most common case is a foot case, called "Foot Sprain".
What is the structure of a joint like?
Mr. Maruyama: The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are elastic and able to move in a balanced way.
Then, the two-sided portion that is covered with "Joint Flexible Cartilage" is surrounded by "Joint capsule" which is covered with "Synovial Membrane".
The editorial team is complicated and structured.
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
There is a layer of slippery tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule, which creates the joint fluid.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronate and condrocyte sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joints smoothly requires good sources of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms do people with Transforming Joints Disease (TJD) typically experience?
Mr. Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of lubrication, so it is important for joints to be flexible and not stick to each other.
Iwaba is a role like that of a maid in a café.
Unfortunately, if you continue to strain yourself, it can cause joint deformity, inflammation, and pain.

You can actually experience the thrill of "Kaiji" series gamble and game in real life! (Real sound) - Yahoo! News
Gambling manga series "Kaiji" centering on male characters which has become popular explosively.
One of the flavors of the original work is an extreme game of life and death.
[Picture] Just watching the feet move...... Challenging the Iron Bridge!
Let's test the game of Kaji, which is actually playable in this place, or which is being practiced as a planning video.
The trap-filled Pachinko Parlour "Nul" appeared in the movie "Gambling Ghost Story".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the customers.
This "pond" has a large trap from the "Hedge Maze" and the "Moving Object" and the "3-Stage Culvert" which makes it almost impossible to infiltrate.
They used every available hand to lower the water table beneath the foundation of the building, and eventually succeeded in overturning the defenses.
The character "Kai" from the anime Kai Ni Tomare made an appearance in the game as a Pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Although things like "One-Thousand-Yen Coins" and difficulty levels have been lowered, it is still possible to enjoy the atmosphere of collecting coins.
The "Star Side Party" was held, in which the participants included a group of investors who had been subjected to a pyramid scheme. It was a re-enactment of the "Torikago" ritual from the "Human Chariot" race.
The debtors were running as fast as they could while they were trying to come up with a plan to avoid falling off the thin steel bones that were set up on the ground 10 meters above.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win the prize money, but there is only one steel bone, which is not enough for safety measures, and the chance of death is quite high.
This steel bridge is very dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game and installed at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", where it is possible to have an extremely close experience.
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors) and is located at a steel-framed bridge which is called "Skybride" and "Victory Bridge" at its end. People are encouraged to walk towards it.
We are taking all necessary safety measures.
Corey Feldman, the comedic actor, has become a sensation in Japan after uploading a video of himself walking across the famous Tokyo Bridge, claiming it can be experienced in Japan through the "Tokyo Bridge Walking" challenge.
This is a two-player card game called "EKaard".
Use one card of the Emperor's, eight cards of the citizen's, and one card of the slave's, making a total of 10 cards, to play on the Emperor's side and the slave's side.
This game is extremely powerful, the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
Kayama is struggling with a harsh rule of "If you lose, you have to cut your own ears off" as he battles against the River Rats.
A machine that can sense changes in blood pressure and body temperature, such as when a person is feeling stressed, by breaking down the ear resembling an iPod was filled with awe and shock. The person then used this machine to cause chaos in the river Ganges by severely lowering their body temperature to an abnormal value, resulting in victory.
The card is available in stores, such as Amazon, where it can be purchased.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, appeared in a movie as the character of Kai and challenged his opponent Eitaro in an epic battle. The video of their fight was quickly uploaded on YouTube and became a hot topic.
Do you want to try the flavor of the wind?
No one wants to get into a difficult situation like the one in the comic, but reading comics can make you feel better.
Through playing the game, you can feel the world view.
Take a step towards the new year, and make it special by visiting a shrine or temple. In this article from the Yamanashi newspaper, there is a picture of a beautifully decorated horse at a Shinto shrine.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Kagami Shrine (in Yamagata City), and a giant ema featuring the Chinese zodiac animal of the upcoming year, the Dog, has appeared.
On November 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students went to the shrine and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting apprenticeship of the original paintings of ema from a craftsman since last year.
Nine students from the Japanese Painting Course taught by Prof. Kazuo Shiraga and Sadamasa Motai at the University of Tokyo Department of Fine Arts have had their works selected for employment. 22-year-old Yui Sasaki (柚衣) is one of them.
The giant horse is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high at the center.
Mr. Tsuchiya drew an image of a person pushing their way through the cherry blossom petals to step into a new year.
I wish to be filled with a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the beauty of nature, even in a world of constant change.
Tsuchiya-san's design is also featured on the tapestry hanging in the hall.

I want to continue living in Tama-no. I propose a workshop for high school students in the city. The theme is "Digital Tama-no News".
What kind of town was the Yamanouchi of 2030?
The student representatives of four high schools in Tama City are discussing the idea of continuing to live in Tama at a workshop.
We are conducting a survey and policy proposal for the "Tamano S.D.G.S. Mirayuku Center" which is a business that provides employment for young people. We are gathering the voices of young people to present to the mayor.
What is funny in such a situation?
When the student was asked about the quality of the teacher, he replied, "When many people gather, it's exciting and energizing. That's when I feel most alive." He also answered, "I'm always drumming and dancing."
The first event was held at the Sunshine Akihabara on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed the theme that was decided upon while they were moving to the "island" that was chosen by each of them. The method of "World Cafe" was used to consider the following topics: "An interesting town", "A livable town", and "A town to feel the atmosphere of life".
Each person's thoughts were written on a slip of paper and organized by sewing them onto a fabric.
A town with many young people is lively and interesting. There are many ways to get around, such as taking the train or bus.
We can't agree on anything, so let's talk some more.
"I thought Tsumanogawa was a boring river, but then I realized it was magical," said Tsumanogawa Commercial High School 3rd Year Student (18).
The third-year student of Bunkyo High School (18) said, "The store is scarce, but the traffic is inconvenient. However, the natural abundance is nice." Through talking with the adults, he was able to notice the regional issues as well as the charm.
The second meeting of the month of December was only for high school students, and was organized to discuss the contents of the proposal.
We are planning to announce the mayor and the education chief in February 2019.
The mayor of Tokyo is speaking about how to foster a sense of belonging among the youth by involving them in local activities. He says, "If we can create opportunities for young people to engage in meaningful activities in their local communities, we can help them develop a strong sense of identity and purpose."

The Secret of Store Shopping (Sankei News) - Yahoo! News
You mustn't forget to take your coat when you go out in the winter, but your head will get cold if you don't put on a hat.
While adjusting the balance by looking into the mirror, I heard a voice saying that it was difficult to understand.
When I thought there might be a secret store hidden somewhere, I was amazed to find a new thing.
The store of the brand "Cotto" (Kotori) is about 1 meter long, and has a more compact size feeling compared to general items.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I make something this short and curvy?"
When you look at it closely, you can see that it is a piece of cloth that has been carefully cut and sewn together into one long, thin piece. It has a net-like pattern all over.
The ends of the net are stretched so that it is possible to pass through them.
Even if you don't connect the two ends, you can wrap it up and keep it.
The fabric is very light and warm.
This year, the popular trend is to combine a sleeveless top with a jacket, so that the jacket can keep you warm while still showing off the sleeveless style.
If you have a store like this, it's definitely convenient.

The documentary on the Beatles at Disneyland is super interesting.
Although Peter Jackson directed The Lord of the Rings, he was not the original director.
There are so many different kinds of beetles, and they are all so fascinating……
Even though we were about to be scattered, we still laughed and enjoyed ourselves. It was a dramatic and funny moment.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I could understand what Paul and George were talking about! I was so surprised! Then I started to talk slowly and carefully, but it was too late. I had already been caught up in the moment and I couldn't stop talking.
It's so irritating when people complain all the time and don't try to help themselves. But then, there's something really inspiring about the atmosphere at Beatles concerts. It's like everyone's in this magical, positive vibe together.
Everyone really starts to play in that special atmosphere.
We were talking about a certain phrase when one of us asked, "What's the point of this?" and started to play the same song over and over again.
It's amazing how quickly you can get the hang of Get Buck.
The scene of a mysterious fun fun fun song slowly entering the ear is recorded in a shaky manner.
It's amazing how much you can see of the process of composing music just by looking at it.
Even though we're only rehearsing before the performance, it's still fun to watch the actors on stage and become happier.
Even though it was only three chapters into the story, the most influential factor behind the disbandment of the Beatles was the environment surrounding them.
Four people started to sing a song together. They were so excited and started to dance. Then they decided to make a live performance. Where should they perform? Talking about it, a producer and some promoters came up with the idea of "Let's take the Beatles around the world!" They started to spread the word and soon they became popular. Everyone was amazed by their unique and wonderful performance.
Since the documentary explains the director's intentions, it seems that Peter Jackson felt that way……
Since Paul is taking care of the maintenance, there are many scenes with him as the protagonist and antagonist. I thought that was strange.

I had to change my job because I was too sick to work. But I wanted to keep doing something related to business, so I decided to switch to a different industry. It was difficult to find a job that suited me, but I'm so glad I was able to find something I'm passionate about.
I was able to find some things that I could be proud of even though I couldn't do much. I hope to be able to find things that I can do and become more independent in the future.
Considering this carefully can be tiring, so it's best to take a break and let your thoughts wander.
I think it is good to consult a company doctor or a lawyer once in a while. There might be some kind of system in place that you should try out at least once.
Even if life is a bit dull in the future, it will still be nice to have pleasant feelings.

In America, a large number of tornadoes caused severe damage to crops and caused an unexpected cold weather (Weather News - Yahoo! News).
A powerful typhoon, named Trami, has been rapidly intensifying since it made landfall in Japan on October 10th (Friday) night and is expected to move towards the America South.
As a result, the atmospheric condition became very unstable due to strong cold air from the south below, and the clouds developed rapidly.
A warm and muggy air mass from the Southwest has been pouring into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking temperatures.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Monday (9th) and Tuesday (10th).
In a place where it was record-breakingly warm, a strong cold front from the skies of 5500m below (-30°C) suddenly descended, resulting in a powerful frontal system and turbulent clouds advancing rapidly.
It was rumored that the dragon eggs were hatching one after another in the outskirts of the village.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the occurrence of hurricanes decreases significantly during the summer and fall. However, there are many cases of large damage during the period from the summer to the fall.
The warning issued in one day during the winter season was reportedly heard 150 times near the location. It was reported in great abundance with a record-breaking number of people.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States has reported 400+ reports of tornadoes and strong winds in just 10 days (Friday) alone.
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the United States that are heavily concentrated along the southern and northern lines that extend from Texas to California and include the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and California respectively.
In the EF Scale in Fukushima Prefecture, the strongest one is EF3, which is the third strongest. It reached 70m/s gust of wind from before and after the moment.
By surveying the damage from the storm, it is possible to determine whether it is an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese Version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the situation of Japanese buildings based on the modified Fujita Scale.
The level of JEF3 infection in the United States is high enough to cause serious damage, such as the destruction of wooden houses.

The voice of the world's largest ever recorded typhoon, Jebi, is being used to help victims in the disaster area. (Yahoo! News)
With regards to the typhoon damage in the U.S. Central and Southern states, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11th (Japanese time: November 12th), showed a remarkable performance of "the greatest typhoon damage in U.S. history" with a spiritual and impressive attitude.
CNN and other American media outlets reported it.
Biden emphasized that he would be able to do anything as the leader of a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the loss of so many lives.
The fear of death has surpassed 100 people.
In Kenitra, Morocco, residents have been removing damaged furniture and belongings from houses affected by the Kenza cyclone for the past 10 nights and continue to do so until 11am on November 15th. The Kenza cyclone has caused more than 30 deaths in at least 6 states.
According to records, the 1925 Mizoram tornado caused damage over a 219-mile (350-kilometer) stretch of land, but meteorologist Brandon Miller of CNN estimated the maximum intensity of this tornado to be 250 miles (400 kilometers).
In the wake of the devastating tornado in Kennett, Missouri, the Christmas shopping season was marred by a 24-hour state of emergency at the large factory, resulting in immense damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were gone.
A woman who was unable to move her legs due to the thickness of the darkness beneath the grave was feeling the weight of the rescuing officer as she searched for the grave above from her smartphone and facebook live broadcast.
In addition to the female announcer's plea for help, the sound of weeping and another female voice singing in a tremolo were heard during the live broadcast of "Happy Birthday to You".
An employee of a convenience store located in Meifield, named Barbara Brown, was found hiding in the basement of her house along with her 5-year-old child after the earthquake warning was issued. She was unharmed.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a terrifying sound like the roar of the sea.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how long it will take, how many months, or how many years it will take to find out. But we will continue our desperate rescue activities.
In Ilinoi State, a warehouse of the internet shopping giant Amazon collapsed and at least 6 people were confirmed dead.
The shockwave from the train car being detached is causing the fences to shake and the roads to be blocked by overturned vehicles.
It is reported that over 40 million people in the US are without power due to the web media reports from Texas.

It is an old saying that different approaches are taken towards the evaluation system of the star chart.
Other countries are arguing to reduce their points based on 5 stars, while Japan is arguing to increase their points by adding/reducing stars.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, and four stars are "deficient element" and "beautiful work".
When judging a work by five stars, if the work is perfect in every aspect, it will be classified as "the highest standard work" and will be awarded all five stars. However, if the work is lacking in any aspect, it will be judged as "deficient work" and will only be awarded three stars. Therefore, I think it is better not to present the concept of stars on the system level.

<Sagashi Hakobune> "Hakobune"s Nearshore Catch and Grill Seafood and Sashimi Sushi (Homemade Tartar Sauce) <Sagashi News>
"Fresh Sashimi and Sushi from the Nearby Sea - Make it at Home with this Special Tuna and Ebi Sushi Recipe"
A colorful bounty of vegetables, carefully crafted into delicious takeout meals at the specialty store "Hakobune".
"We want to make a restaurant where people can enjoy delicious food at a reasonable price," said Kagetsu Kikuchi (39) and his wife, Yumiko (38). The couple opened a restaurant last August.
One of the popular menu items at the tempura restaurant is "Fresh Tuna and Ebi Fry" (1000 yen).
People sometimes buy nice things at the market.
"Flaky pastries like croissants are popular in Japan, but they're often too sweet. Ebi-flaky is the perfect balance of sweet and savory, with a crunchy texture and subtle flavor of shrimp." (Kikuko San)
Vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, as well as Hino hikari rice, miso soup, and tofu are all available at the supermarket.

A family's long journey to protect the environment in China's rural areas has been featured in the Japanese media. (JBpress News) - Yahoo! News
(Katou Yasuyuki: Hong Kong Companies Find Asia Consultant) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with over 1000 species of mammals, and 3000 species of plants.
We recognize the value of biodiversity as proclaimed by the self-governing body, and not only do the self-governing body perform environmental protection, but also actively promote environmental activities by the local people.
The province of Sichuan in China's southwestern region is one of the regions located in the area.
Siam Paran is a region located on the border of Laos and Myanmar, which is the starting point of the Tai (Tai) people and the Lue (Lue) people of the Kingdom of Thailand. It is a region where many minority ethnic groups live and work together.
The source of the Mekong River is flowing through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Saisiyat people (Southwestern Tai people) live in the Saisiyat Autonomous County of Taiwan. The area of Saisiyat is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wildlife and 20% of the species of plants in China.
This time, I visited Lixin Liu, the founder of the environmental protection activity in Shanghai, and had a talk with him about the contents of the activity.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together. They have been doing it for 20 years.
What was that sudden noise?
Mr. Li has been engaged in environmental protection activities under the name "Tenchu" since 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This place is the only tropical rainy forest in China, and it boasts a great biodiversity.
Despite that, the economic growth has been slowing down.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, we had to import rubber from China, which was in short supply due to the previous hot-climate rainforest harvesting.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
After that, I was married to the journalist and became friends with him.
Was Mr. Li interested in nature conservation before?
My father is from Shimane Prefecture, but I am not interested in the meaning of the term "heat-tolerant rainforest" or its biological diversity.
We have become accustomed to advancing our project without knowing much about it.
Even though there is no special back, people who are tall are admired. Why is that?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.
In that moment of self-confidence, a moment when you believe in yourself, a miracle of nature will be born.
That person is definitely confident in their ability and has a strong sense of self-belief.

I think it's interesting to talk about what people are wearing and their fashion sense, but it can get quite detailed.
Is it okay if it's a bit small?
Even though it's visible, it's still a mystery.
I think about how beautiful it is.
There was nothing remarkable about what he said, so I couldn't understand the meaning.
Did you wash your face with a lot of water?
What would happen if the secret was revealed to the sakura san?

[Personal Memory Loss] CTD was the cause of my forgetting my own environment, taking about 1 month and a half to be identified.
Despite the fact that I had already stabilized my data by the time of the GW, I still couldn't find the time to play due to multiple factors such as CTDs and taking a break.
Why didn't you log analysis with the.Net Script Framework? (It's easy to understand in a few minutes.) Some errors related to DLL series and hash functions can't be ignored in crash logs.
The timing of the main CTD is important.
* All plug-ins, such as Papyrus and.NET Script Framework, should leave a trace in the log.dll plug-ins' log without leaving any footprints.
If NPCs are killed/attacked in a short period of time, the Essentials will disappear (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree氏SE updated version reopening). OFF will improve this.
* When the camera work for the kills of NPCs is off, it can significantly improve the gameplay by setting the kills off in the.ini file: Is there a conflict between the settings of DAR and Nemesis? However, the maximum number of DAR animations is limited to 10,000.
* (Basic Outdoor) Field Movement + Partial Magic (Example: Ice Trap Run) Activation, NPC Death: Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID Usage NPC Applicable Setting (MCM's Right Top) All Off, All Improved 5 Times in a Row.
Is there a misconfiguration of armor and body meshesheets that causes this issue? The default SPID usage in 2.0 has a syntax error but the result is intended to be an effect applied to NPCs with the prerequisite Perk "Actor".
At first, I focused on OnHit relationships and movement/combat MOD (DLL related) by soaking my clothes in water. However, this resulted in a feeling like this.
I have never heard of any similar reports in English, German, or French.
Those who are facing similar CTD problems in a Japanese environment may find it helpful to refer to this post as a reminder.
Everyone was excitedly talking and laughing in the mental room.
Around it is not interesting, but same-aged people are still family.
When you look around, you can see that person is very strange. But if you think about it in a positive way, it can be a fun and relaxing experience.
He was so scared that he started to shiver uncontrollably.
Even though I am not mentally ready to retire, I feel like there is a limit to what I can do before I retire.
I am thinking about the importance of spiritual care visitation nursing - today's visitation nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from dual-diagnosis, I have been undergoing long-term counseling and therapy. However, I am fortunate to have formed a strong bond with the visiting nurse who has been providing my care. She is very patient and has built a great relationship with me.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to manage medication and other related matters (such as dressings), it is more important for those with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which I thought was important in today's visiting nursing.
Today, we discussed the differences between men and women, and it was quite amusing.
Talking about sexual desire between men and women, or how she decided to get a divorce, or such interesting topics can be discussed during a visit to the nursing home.
Although I am wearing a tamagotchi, I am actually a girl.
When the visiting nurses' station at the psychiatric hospital was closed, there was no one to give instructions to the visiting nurses or the occupational therapists, so I heard stories like, "This place is where medical care is provided, so you should know what to do," from people who had worked there.
I am using the social welfare system, but it is a small visiting care station run by the social welfare organization, so I am grateful for the kindness of the staff, who understands my mental illness and treats me kindly. I hope to find a good caregiver like Frank.
You are so beautiful.
Both those who are receiving psychiatric care and those who are considering it should be mindful.
Visiting a nursing home is very meaningful for people with mental and physical illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
Even though I was angry, I decided to cancel the contract from this place.
Don't worry about it.
Even though I knew it was a fake warning in English, I still got scared and started crying.
Why are you trying to speak English?
Things that can be thought of as causes are numerous. For example, if we consider global warming, it is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
I don't know what people who made it are displaying in Japanese.
Problems with Language Identification.
The settings of the browser have become English-preferred.

The Japanese patent for hydrogen technology and the Chinese five-year delay in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap (Central News Agency Japanese Language Edition).
The Japanese government announced the hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 600,000 electric vehicles across the nation and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of hydrogen per kilogram was 6,000 yen (approximately 577 yen).
Unfortunately, the target of 27% for fuel cell vehicles in the 2011 fiscal year has not been met yet. (Approximately 1700 units)
The percentage of hydrogen stations in Japan has reached 38% (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is almost the same as the load map announced at the time of the previous announcement.
It has been found that the loadmap of water resources for the government is far below the target value.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) released a report titled "The Current Situation and Policy Directions of Hydrogen Economy" on November 12.
According to reports, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the lithium-ion battery for automobile is supplied by Toshiba (Japan), White Gold Catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), Membrane Film by DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA).
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, are leading the world market for hydrogen technology patent applications, with an average growth rate of 14% per year since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of water production and fuel cells in Japan (2014-2020 cumulative), Korea is the fifth in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has been dominated by six countries, who collectively occupy more than 50% of the world's market share. In reality, they are the low-end producers.
The order of patent application filing in Japan, China, the U.S., and Europe is China, the U.S., Japan, and Europe.
In 2017, China overtook the US to become the largest economy in the world. Since then, it has been expanding the gap between the two economies.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) ranked 4th, but China (4721 cases) was 22% higher than the standard.
The Japanese government should designate "national strategic technology" as a category of investment and development expenses exempt from taxes.
I have been waiting for two months since I had surgery to cut the tendons of my fingers.

U.S. weapons and medicines have arrived in Ukraine as part of a training mission for its troops (CNN.co.jp).
The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine reported on December 12th that weapons, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine as part of the assistance plan that was approved by the Ukrainian government.
Military aid is equivalent to 600 million dollars (approximately 68 billion yen), and the last equipment item, such as a radar station for identifying launch sites of rocket attacks, is being transported to Ukraine.
According to the Caribbean News Agency, these weapons of mass destruction also included combat vehicles such as tanks and missiles.
The purpose of Russia's military support for Ukraine is to strengthen Ukraine's military capabilities in the border area, including by increasing its defense capabilities.
The U.S. is monitoring the movements of the Russian military and reinforcing its warning, while negotiating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and taking countermeasures in case of a Russian attack on Ukraine.
The Baiden Great Leader had agreed to accept weapons assistance from Ukraine's Zelensky Great Leader when he visited the White House on September 1, 2020.
The military support from the U.S. to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of approximately 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, resulting in an increase of over 25 billion dollars in aid.
The U.S. military also participated in the training exerDescriptor: The U.S. military also participated in the training exercise.
The State of Florida sent troops to participate in the multinational training exercise in accordance with the plan for Ukraine support.
According to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of Japan, the European Union Special Forces are playing a significant role in training and advising the Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of American special forces deployed in Ukraine is still classified as a secret.
The summit meeting between the two heads of state of Denmark and Russia, which was held on the 7th of this month, was followed by a tense standoff between the two countries due to the situation in Ukraine.
If the United States is attacked, it will impose a harsh economic sanction.

The LDP and Komeito are planning to raise the consumption tax in a stealthy manner by freezing the pre-tax payment system and cutting taxes for the wealthy. The DPJ and the Japanese Communist Party should take a firm stance against this!
The first special issue of Weekly Daiyamondo, published on December 18th, 2018, is about "Chatting with Family at the End of the Year and the Beginning of the Next".
This is a technique of sending and receiving gifts before and after a meeting.
In the discussion of the integration of consumption tax and corporate tax, it was reported that the 2022 Tax Reform Plan would be postponed. However, it is likely that pre-consumption tax will be restricted in the near future.
How do the rules of etiquette change with different cultures?
The LDP will be holding a tax reduction meeting with the DPJ's Mr. Yukio Hatoyama and Mr. Seiji Maehara, the two members of the House of Representatives, in order to discuss ways to bridge the gap between the two parties and to promote beneficial tax cuts.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Miyazaki Keiji)
In order to utilize pre-emptive donations to companies from the asset-rich families, the government should consider the following measures from the perspective of taxation: (1) Clarifying the criteria for taxation of pre-emptive donations and taxation of income from donations. (2) Establishing a neutral tax system that takes into account the timing of asset transfers. (3) Conducting a thorough examination of the potential effects of taxation on asset transfers.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill, which was announced by the ruling party last year, has caused a wide range of movements, not just among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because it changes the rules of succession and increases the burden of taxation, it is called "forbidden donation" and is done to increase the burden of succession taxes.
The steel rule for reducing high-stepped progressive taxes is "to reduce taxable income."
The pre-tax contribution of the most powerful company in the world, which has a house in the three major metropolitan areas, has been widely utilized even though it is a small amount.
Discussion on the integration of the two types of taxes, namely, the consumption tax and the gift tax.
On December 10th, 2020, the 22nd Annual Tax Revision Committee released a draft of the tax reform plan, titled "Making Clear the Nature of Gift and Inheritance Taxes". The plan proposed a number of changes to the current tax system, such as clarifying the nature of gift and inheritance taxes, increasing the tax-free allowance, and introducing a new taxation system for inherited assets. The committee also stressed the importance of continuously reviewing the plan in order to ensure its effectiveness.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Audit, Mr. Kamiyama, were speaking.
At the time of relocation, it is beneficial to lose the advantage and disadvantage equally, regardless of when the tax and burden are imposed.
"What kind of problems will come up as a result of integration? We are simulating the situation and will have three more chances for pro bono donations."
Even if it is not certain, it is the near future, and it is necessary to consider tax reduction measures as a form of pre-tax gift. Cutting large taxes is not correct.
How will the rules of succession and donation taxes change specifically?

The team that won the first three games of the NFL season felt a variety of emotions, according to the players (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News).
This match, John's throw was caught by the Patterson's pass. It was only caught 3 times.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season, and it was the first and only time the Bills have played the Giants in a regular season game.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, the first running back to ever rush for over 2000 yards, played for the Buffalo Bills.
The Builders were defeated by the Simpson and the one-man RB Gym Blackstone in a weightlifting contest.
The reason for the maximum offensive of the Payton Rottweilers was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains unchanged in terms of latitude from Hokkaido's Sapporo.
Thus, this day was very cold, with the temperature almost at freezing point, and a strong wind of 18m/s blew, snowing before the match.
The buildings were only changed locally, and there was no major change in the selection of players.
For every 30 passes, the run should be 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
Interception was impossible, and we couldn't decide what to do next.
There were 4 Red Zone invasions in the Offensive Series and the Defensive Team got 10 points.
After the third quarter, they continued to run all the way to the red zone.
Although we only won 3 points in 3 matches, we didn't give up.
The defense before the last game.
The buildings that were chasing after the 4 points turned into Penalties at 3rd & 9th and 3rd & 14th.
The distance to the goal is 18 yards.
The Quarterback was surrounded by the rush of the defense on 3rd and 14, and he escaped to the right side of the field by throwing the ball out of the pocket.
So I threw a pass at the endzone to try to catch the td but it failed.
At this play, Esper W. Digger was running around the right outer area, but he couldn't get into the Endzone.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from outside the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabrielle Davidson. The pass was deflected by Payton's DB Miles Brian and Arlen failed to make a successful completion.
Brian had been working on a WRC project in the buildings, but he stopped to watch the movements of the people in the middle of the way and released the beezy. He then reacted to the pass.
Allen threw two Endorses in order to pass the Reshiram and Zekrom.
We couldn't decide whether to take a 4th down or not, but there was no need to take a 3rd down since we weren't chasing any TDs.
It is possible to achieve a first down in two attempts of a play.
Since I was still at the 2-minute mark, I had to sprint to the finish line in order to utilize my own running ability.

"Sometimes it's time to let go of things, and sometimes it's time to replace them with something new. Here are three items to help you spruce up your kitchen for the long haul." (Harper's BAZAAR (Hāpāruz Bazā ))
Sponge
Even if you frequently change the sponge, it will eventually become dirty again.
Even though kitchen sponges are often used to clean dishes, they can actually harbor bacteria and fungi. Recent studies have shown that bacteria and fungi can reproduce rapidly in kitchen sponges even when they are not used for cleaning.
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends exchanging a clean sponge once a week for 1 week.
Manana board
The United States Department of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to replace damaged or worn out wooden planks with new ones.
Whenever a wound or a fissure advances, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria start to proliferate.
If you are still a big man, then dilute 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water with an odorless liquid bleach to make a tablespoon of the solution and frequently disinfect your table spoon. Do not forget.
Immerse a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.
In a beautiful, clear water, use a gentle, clean paper towel to wipe the water gently and dry it lightly.
Dishware that has been chipped or cracked.
Even though it may be painful to divide your favorite magical cup, the uneven surface will become a warm and cozy home for bacteria and fungi.
That is, it is the cause of the missing part of the lip and the spilled drink.
I'm so excited to buy a new magical wand!

Community markets and trading are different things.
Should we use the Steam system at the community market?
This function can be used to commit red-handed fraud as it enables people to pay for items without using their own money.

I bought a Ryzen7 5800X in September and replaced it with a B550 and a Tomahawk.

Even if the BIOS has been damaged, FlashBIOS can be used to rewrite it without any problems.

Why do you feel ashamed of having brand products?
If it's a thing that can't be seen, don't bother bringing it. It's not like you can show off a Louis Vuitton Monogram with your LV and write it down.

I think Japan is great.
In Japan, it is.
There is no connection between the Gajin Wind and the Kagura.
It's better to say something early than to remain silent, right? "Why do you keep quiet all the time?"
Why can't I just be treated as a foreigner without any relation? I was so angry when I said that.
I'm so frustrated with the low probability of success. I can't even dream of success.
Even though I had been living overseas, I still felt a sense of belonging to Japan. I was surprised when I encountered people who were so intolerant of other cultures.
If you appear to be a Westerner, there is no need to be concerned about having an evil spirit. Just be yourself and you will be fine.
If my friends were from Europe or America, I would call them by their last names. But since they are Japanese, I call them by their first names instead.
If you're friends with someone from Japan, they'll probably be really nice.
Even though it is ordinary and plain, it is still important to handle it with care, as it may cause unexpected problems in the future. For example, if you talk about it now, it may be helpful.
Even if you speak Japanese, you can't escape the rules of the country.
Even though he had no relation with them, he always raised his glass higher than others at the drinking party.
Japanese people have a lot of unique habits, such as bowing and greeting each other with a lot of respect. I think it's amazing how they handle these habits in both formal and informal situations.
Japanese people are known for their unique and delicate mannerisms, regardless of their personality. (Including myself.) They tend to be quite observant of their surroundings.

The translated text may give a slightly awkward feeling, but it is understandable and there is no level restriction when playing (I thought it was interesting when I heard it from other people).

There are various reasons why people want to have a place of their own to relax. Some people want to have a place to call their own, while others want a place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been causing a stir among the youth. It is said to be full of "exciting" and "daring" content.
There is no battle in the story, and readers don't seem to like the training and refining of skills either.
Even though it took 2 years to complete the training to become a master of the same jump manga "One Piece", he was able to draw only with a brush and finish the rest joyfully.
There is a mysterious charm to the exotic landscape of the place where the ancient ruins of the temple can be found. However, there is also the fact that staying in the same location for too long can lead to a lack of variety.
After helping Chōjiro, the main character of "Kinmokusei no Shiro", to complete his training, Tōka Rōji was asked to give up his own life in order to obtain the power of murder and theft. He was told, "To seize the power of murder and theft for others!!"
Weaklings have no rights or choices, and are easily subdued by the strong with barely any effort........
"Sou-gintsu" (lit. "Demon Slayer Corps Entrance Examination Hopeful") Tsuchikage left the area near the Kagami-ike Pond and introduced the nearby shrine. (This is either a reference to the character's noble and generous nature or a shameless attempt at fan service.)
After their first contact, Kagami Taiga and Kuroko Tetsuya were talking about what to do when Kagami heard that Kuroko had eaten someone. Kagami's response was "That's too slow" and he threw a punch.
In the midst of fan conversations, a never-ending exchange of stories and jokes can be heard.
If she were to follow the demonic sister, there is a possibility that she will be forced to make a judgement in that moment.
Initiation and Entering into Practice from Conceptions of the Heart.
We went to the mountain in the fog, following the man who had not completed his training, and reached the summit by dawn. Along the way, we encountered a river of fire and a waterfall of sparks.
Before entering the mountain to perform the ritual of purification, one must make sure to check for hidden traps, such as pitfalls, hidden rocks, and snares.
Despite the intense stench of the rotting corpse of the witch Wana, the person was able to work with their hands and correct her mistakes with the help of their nose. They avoided the witch's curse by doing so.
Even though it was a sudden attack, he was able to avoid it completely by raising his body strength suddenly! He was so amazed that he couldn't help but exclaim, "It's amazing how powerful I've become!"
Suddenly, people who were ordinary before gained tremendous strength and skill without noticing. When they wake up, they can use this power and skill naturally as if it was their own potential.
People who have put in effort deserve to be rewarded, but there's nothing to be rewarded for when it comes to effort without results. The "Effort Equivalent Exchange" is a superhuman power that relies on the applause of humans, and is quite unlike the rule of the devil in this work.

Samusung Electronics has opened a new "DX" department which emphasizes user experience, integrating home appliances and mobile devices (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News)
Following the integration of Samusung Electronics' CE and IM businesses, the company has decided to call the new entity DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect it in the organizational reform to be announced on the 12th.
Through various services available from mobiles to home appliances, users will be able to strengthen their experience (Experience).
Samsumg Electronics announced that it has integrated the CE and IM businesses to form a new DX business unit, which includes VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, MX (Mobile Experience), and Networking from various business units.
The person in charge of Samsumg Electronics explained, "This name change reflects our long-term business structure and future vision, as well as global leadership enhancement."
We emphasized the idea that by providing services and solutions that reflect customer needs and optimizing the experience through various consumer products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, we can create a pleasant and enjoyable one.
The launch of the unified leadership ship system was the impetus for creating a boundary-crossing synergy effect across the entire company, resulting in the creation of products and services that were both discriminated against and named after the strategy.
Samusun Electronics is envisioning a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the seamless connection of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
What is the difference between 1500BCE and the present time?
How do you say it in Japanese?
This is about the year 1500 before the Kigen era.
Before Christ (BC) means "before Christ's time" in a Christian context, but it is often used to refer to a period of time before the birth of Christ. In recent years, the abbreviation BCE (Before Common Era) has become more common in an effort to be more inclusive of non-Christian religions.
BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era (Western Era).

A 24-car collision occurred in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The driver of the truck was uninjured, but he was charged with careless driving. (Television Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the truck driver involved in the crash in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, which involved 24 vehicles, did not have any injuries and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is believed that the crash was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Matsumoto City, and 12 people were injured in the accident.
The police first caused a traffic accident and arrested a 71-year-old man for suspicion of drunk driving. On the 12th, they sent the suspect, 54-year-old Noguchi Takayuki, for further investigation.
The suspect in the Yasuhiro Yasuda case kept walking even after his car ran out of brakes, and was found to have lost consciousness shortly after the fire department arrived.
It has been confirmed that the suspect in the Nishikawa case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching the suspect's home for clues and investigating the current situation in detail.

The fourth chapter of the manga "Oginomama X" was reviewed! (Weekly Pocket News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics began in Volume 3 and has now concluded in Volume 4!
The first chapter was filled with tension as the match progressed from the opening ceremony to the decisive final battle. Despite the focus on a single match, the story was packed with new and exciting developments.
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review Submitter Name: OginumamaX (Star 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling Begins Even Before the Match Starts!
This four-volume series was drawn with great care and attention to detail, but it would be a shame if it ended here. Therefore, it was decided to draw a volume depicting the ring match as well.
We started from the basics and gradually improved our skills in teamwork, tactics, and formations. We also trained hard to create a unique and powerful atmosphere for the match. Despite all of this, there was no guarantee of victory.
As the tension of the story slowly builds up, the reader can feel the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming battle. This feeling of suspense is heightened as the story progresses, making it more realistic and immersive.
Meanwhile, the third-place match between Teriyaki Man and Ramen Man was decided in the decisive match before the grand final.
While I was looking for something special as a battle card, my favorite lame-duck-turned-poster-boy for the match said, "From now on, it's my turn to shine!!"
Trying to make a pop sound with a drum.
Unfortunately, the silent but powerful Tamamori stopped the terrifying man with his sword, and the scene changed suddenly and peacefully.
This is the last chance to fight against the powerful Kinnikuman inside the tournament. There is no more opportunity to surrender.
Despite the fact that it is so difficult to find a suitable partner, I still keep on trying.
If you could see such a future, you wouldn't be able to resist hoping for it!
It's amazing how much has changed since that time when we used to gather around the karuta table. Even I, as a manga artist, am feeling the pain of this sudden change!
Although the fight between those two was short, it still left a mark. The venue was filled with the tears of the losers, who had to face the reality of losing the match after the battle.
"You must never rely on just your strength! ！"
That is a lifelong struggle.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the reader and the protagonist, so there's no need to force it anymore. I think I'm starting to understand why the protagonist is so powerful.

This is a great thing to do.
I think this is the most important point of the whole story.

FBC Fuji Television will hold a winter illumination event at Mt. Aoba in Takahama, Fukui Prefecture (Japan) on the weekend of December 14th and 15th.
At the base of the tallest mountain in Tokyo, the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, the winter illumination is beginning for the first time. The garden is bathed in a beautiful light.

At this point, it is considered that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
I tried it one more time after warming the room.
3.) No action.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will blink once and then stop immediately.
After that, there was nothing to say.
I tried plugging in the power plug again, but it didn't work.
4.) Unplug the motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, and try to power on the computer without any other parts connected.
There have been rumors that the sound of "Bubbles Bubbles Bubbles" has been coming from the PSU fan for a long time, but it is not the cause.
We'll try to find an ATX power supply later.

The popularity of emoji has been increasing significantly in Japan, and a ranking of the most used emoji in 2021 has been released.
The character I use the most is a crying emoji.
I believe that picture characters are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there have been many applications and tools that enable users to create stamps instead of using emoticons or emojis.
Spicy, simple, no reply needed, polite element.
In the modern age, the importance of soft atmosphere is emphasized by the necessity of emoticons!
Everyone is using cute emoticons these days.
[Viewing the Entire Ranking of Picture Characters] 2021, the Most Used Picture Character Ranking 2021, Worldwide Top 10!
Positive and bright emoticons are ranking in widely.
According to the Unicode standard, 92% of the world's net population is using emoticons.
The most popular character is 5% of the total characters!
Even though the laughing emoticons with the first, third, and fifth places are difficult to use, they're still pretty cute, aren't they?
When it's fun time, happy time is always great!
Even if it's not the right time, you can still use it selfishly in your own way. But since there are fewer people like that, it's alright, right?
People who have never used a top 10 emoji once are rare.
I want to try something new.
