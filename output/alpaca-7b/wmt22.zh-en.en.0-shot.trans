The students of Zhejiang University performed at the annual meeting of the university and showed their research achievements, which made people amazed.
Using air to wash hands, smelling the air to diagnose diseases, and carefully searching for the source of the mist were presented at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these fruits are students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students began from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical values, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The biomedical engineering team of the university showed a smartphone-sized biometric sensor at the exhibition.
All you need to do is take a deep breath and exhale slowly into the instrument. It can then determine your body's health condition from the component of the breath you exhaled.
Zhang Dingfang introduced the sensor and smartphone connection, after which air pollutants will be reported on the phone.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market. Common physical parameters that can be detected include temperature and heart rate.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as stone and clay, to detect chemical elements. Its sensitive "touch" allows it to go deeper and more accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Smart Surgical Lamp: A Surgeon's Highly Sensitive Eye-Mitten.
In addition to smartphones, the operating room has also started using smart surgical lamps.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Invention Exhibition of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 2019.
Zhu Lin and her team from the Institute of Optoelectronics and Engineering have opened up a new perspective in traditional surgical lighting by inventing a Smart LED Surgical Light.
Many diseases can be detected in the early stage and removed timely, and there is a relationship between the light used in the doctor's office and the surgery.
If doctors cannot identify and treat all tumor cells in the early stage of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has four light pads, adjusting the light spectrum to enh Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at the Historic CourthouseNew Public Artwork Unveiled at the Historic CourthouseThe City of Woodbury is pleased to unveil a new public artwork at the Historic Courthouse. The artwork, titled “The Woodbury Story,” was created by local artist and Woodbury resident, David Hutchinson. The artwork is a 3-dimensional sculpture made from recycled materials that tells the story of Woodbury’s history and growth. The sculpture is located on the east side of the Courthouse and is visible from the street.The artwork was funded by the Woodbury Arts Commission and the City of Woodbury. The Arts Commission is a volunteer group that works to promote and support the arts in Woodbury. The Commission is responsible for selecting and approving public art projects, as well as providing grants to support local artistic endeavors.The City of Woodbury is proud to have this new public artwork as a part of its community.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and the patient's habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, the affiliated children's hospital of Zhejiang University, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash hands: Saving water and feeling cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with a towel, squeezing out the handkerchief, and Li Qui Zhang and his classmates invented a set of "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the device for washing hands, our body weight can be pressed out of the air.
He was like a person playing a wind instrument.
The compressed air that was released formed a fluid and combined with the water at the dragon's head.
That's great! We can finally get our hands clean and dry.
The experiment proved that the effect of the colored detergent was the same as that of the ordinary detergent.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure cleanlin Home » News » News » 2018 » Council Tax Reduction Scheme 2019/20Council Tax Reduction Scheme 2019/20The Council Tax Reduction Scheme for 2019/20 has been agreed by the Council and will come into effect from 1 April 2019.The Council Tax Reduction Scheme sets out how much money people on low incomes can get towards their Council Tax bill.

Emergency measures: Rescue operations should be taken as soon as possible when a sudden event occurs, such as when a fire breaks out in a rescue vehicle.
After the accident, the rescue process of the car was still in progress. In fact, it was a critical time. The key was still in this period of time.
This is the time when we need urgent rescue.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or difficulty breathing or coughing, our window of life would be only four minutes, gold four minutes!

In China, there are about 300 million people who die from unexpected deaths every year, which is the most dangerous one called sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average rate of survival is 15%.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, you can survive up to 78%, with less than 1% chance of failure in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is the first reaction of Lu Le.
If a person suffers from cardiac arrest, their breathing and heartbeat will stop, as will their respiration and circulation. In this situation, CPR is useless.
We must do artificial respiration and external compression in order to possibly save a person.
I discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of mindset to learn quickly and save lives. However, when the situation arises, they come too late. Therefore, I would like to call on everyone to go and learn this skill, so that we can make timely reactions in the face of emergencies.
Even if it is uncertain, it is still possible to save a person's life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross center. I am registered at the Red Cross center in Zhuhai and I have benefits too.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself 25 years ago. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the list of goals was done several months ago, but it was definitely accomplished!
After I had finished applying for the other exams I wanted to take, I decided to apply for a diving certificate. I had seen in the Little Red Book that there was also a diving rescue certificate, so I thought it might be useful to have. In the end, having the diving rescue certificate proved to be very helpful when it came to taking the exam!

But you have to say this movie is not a bright point and it is not at least a pleasant selection.
There are many different kinds of popcorn, allowing you to fall asleep peacefully in the movie theater, and making you feel angry and full of regret afterwards, just like the monkeys on the mountain of fire. It can use innumerable ways to ignite your rage.
On this point, Han Cang really is a heaven-sent gentleman.
The most painful part of the film was the one that was a replica of a creature from the "Kingdom" series of novels, with its body parts hidden in a way that was reminiscent of a small horse's cloak.
After you finish watching it, you will be left with a feeling of suspicion as to whether there is a hidden message in the movie. However, when you think about it carefully, it turns out to be just a joke.
I found it difficult to understand some of the simpler scenes.
The man's hometown should be located in the south, and he should live with his wife according to the customs of the place.
She wished to go and see the snow in the east, so she arranged for her father to take her in a slew of cars to the east.
Are old people from the south going to see snow in the east?
He and his father were very relaxed.
After that, this old man didn't have any more text to read.
How did the female owner of the boat get the business license to operate a bar on the boat?
Why did the Flying Car Party manage to finish the mountain road so quickly?
Then the car stopped at the side of the road, and the four drivers of the car couldn't find it.
This tool is too obvious.
Why did the illegal party of flying cars become a suspect?
Why didn't the police report the high-interest loan? There was a special question about the difficulty in the movie "The Police".
A grown man can't even use a smartphone, yet he doesn't know how to use a room key to open the door of a hotel, so he forces himself to arrange and look for the hotel's staff outside the door, and then sleeps outside the door.
This kind of mysterious and exotic scenes are abundant throughout the entire film, due to the scenes being too explicit to the point that I can't help but recall them whenever I think about it.
Besides the plot, the main theme of the movie was also disappointing. It was like a shallow collage of uninteresting and annoying scenes.
You will think of a funny movie when you see the movie's beginning, after 20 minutes you will guess it is a motivational movie, but after watching half of it you will feel it might be a movie to show the difficulty of young people's survival in the town. Finally, you will be confused and have doubts about yourself. Why do you need to run to the movie theater to enjoy the big toilet?
For most people, it is quite familiar with various kinds of films, such as you want to make a car chase scene, then you will have to work hard + comedy, then tell the audience one bird with a heavenly gift of success.
If you want to take a love scene, then you just need to be realistic and talk about the frustration between the young people and the service staff in the small town.
If you want to reflect reality, then the most important thing is to avoid unrealistic things in the world.
(For example, the role of Zhang Xiao in the play "The Rise of the Phoenix") was burned alive, but still managed to sing a song. Then he was unable to resist the temptation of watching some connected to the brain.
As a female lead, she was very intelligent and could express herself in various ways, like a 5-year-old child. I was clueless as to why this was the case, either an actress's intelligence or the director's requirements.
I also found it quite interesting why he would be so passionate about adding a car crash scene to his own movie.
Such arrangements for the movie are stored in the Spring Festival, is it to give the audience a hard time?

The advantages of using hollow concrete blocks in constructing a well are as follows: the four sides of the block are uneven and the block is composed of a combination of a trench and a lock.
The brick-and-mortar structure of a wall is far superior to a slab in terms of anti-seismic performance.
The module is used for the underground structure, which is composed of bored piles after combined with the brick wall. The bored piles are connected in the horizontal direction and filled with concrete afterwards. Thus, a two-way reinforced and waterproof underground network structure is formed.
The module is equipped with transverse and longitudinal reinforcements, which can increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition to using concrete to check the foundation of the well and the seepage of the well, it is easy to cause settlement, subsidence, and water leakage, etc. The wall and the module of the machine are mechanically stable, simple operation, and standard size.

The modern apprenticeship system of the school is to be implemented in Chengdu. Upon enrollment, students will become employees of the school.
Yesterday, the reporter from the city education committee became aware of the city's plan to launch a "modern apprenticeship" model of human resource training in 60 schools. At the same time, the students accepted the training will be equipped with apprenticeship identity, and will be recruited by the trial unit after enrollment.
The Education Bureau requires that all private schools recruit and enrol students in accordance with the regulations, clearly identify the student's status as either a full-time or part-time student, and enter into a tripartite agreement with the school and the employer. For students under 16 years old, a guardian, school, employer and student must sign a contract. The Education Bureau must be notified of the student's name, age, job title, employer's name and address, and the specific job duties and responsibilities.

The school needs to reform its human resource development model.
Schools, companies, and the government should jointly design a plan to cultivate talents, jointly produce professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, and enterprise teacher qualification standards, and quality control standards and implement them.
A period of internship is set as a trial period for students to cultivate their professional skills, and the duration of internship is usually 6 months.
In the practice of enterprise, the implementation of enterprise team teaching should be based on the characteristics of different disciplines, one teacher and five students can form a study group, to ensure that students are familiar with the skills needed for each position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to 2019, our city will select 60 modern teaching assistant teams, with each team consisting of 50 people. The total number of students to be trained is about 3000.
Following the principle of trial and error, step by step advancement from point to face, exploring and establishing a long-term recruitment, training and integration mechanism of school and company, enhancing students' employability and improving their employment rate and quality.

Doctors in South Africa: The power of social media and traditional media is strong, but it is mostly used for light diseases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new variant of the Coronavirus is more contagious and spreads faster than SARS.
According to the Associated Press, the spread of AIDS in South Africa has been reported by a group of 5,000 doctors from the province of Kwazulu-Natal. They said that the symptoms of the new cases of AIDS are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever similar to flu symptoms.
The organization's overall coordinator Unben Pillay (M.D.) said that he has to see about 30 patients a day, but still hasn't had any patients needing to be hospitalized.
They can control the disease at home and most people will recover within 10 to 14 days.
He said, this package includes elderly patients and those with health problems, these people groups are naturally more easily infected with the coronavirus due to the weakened immune system.
He said, compared to the previous outbreak of the same disease in Delhi, the new cases he treated had difficulty breathing and had low haemoglobin levels.
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
During the two weeks after the first case of pneumonic plague in Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although we have collected enough data, it still needs a few weeks time. The doctor's observation and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the severe cases of the new coronavirus were found among the hospitalized patients, which is half of the proportion of the first wave of the epidemic. The average hospital stay time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the recent cases, only 3% died, while in South Africa the early cases had a mortality rate of up to 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, cited data and other reports to say: “Currently, almost all the evidence suggests that this is a mild disease.”
He still said: "We need to obtain the data in the later period."
Under normal circumstances, the time of hospitalization and death due to the epidemic is later, but we have entered the time of this epidemic wave only two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospital rates, as well as testing current vaccines and treatments.
Despite being the world's most important new coronavirus disease, there have been few reported cases in South Africa, making it the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to the health department, the number of new cases of illness in Guangdong Province in December increased by 400%. Tests showed that the majority of the cases were infected with the novel virus.

Education evaluation: What should we do to save the children?
If the famous public service advertisement of "No buying, no selling, just killing" is compared to the popular "No harm, no foul" mentality, then in a good environment without coercion, the prevention of crime will be more effective, the risk of harm will be minimized, the cost will be high, and the crime will not occur.
Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department announced the launch of a platform for missing children.
This is the authoritative platform for publishing information about lost children, and quickly finding the lost children with the help of the Internet.
After hearing the name of this App, "Tuan Yuan", I felt warm and cozy.
The new technology means not only the name "Wen-yi" (literally "culture and art") but also the feeling of love and joy, and the application of information is very practical and effective.
To apprehend the perpetrator and to recover the abducted child is the primary goal, to ensure the safety of the child and their family's freedom.
Only then was it the judging and punishing of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as follows: crime, punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.
Before breaking the case, we should pay attention to the physical safety of the victim first.
In times of crisis, it is important to take a step back and think before speaking or acting. Arguments can become heated and topics such as whether or not children should face the death penalty can become divisive. It is important to remain calm and think carefully before engaging in such discussions.
Based on the experience of handling similar cases, people tend to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the money.
Searching for a missing child can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The further the child is from home, the more challenging it will be to find them.
Under such circumstances, extracting information from platforms like "Quick Circle" can be directly helpful in cracking cases, searching for missing children, which is an effective action.
After all, "putting down the bandits" was a task that required the entire legal system to be put in place.
To protect the interests of victims of crime, to safeguard children and families, from perfecting the law to ensuring the security of the law, and from the secrecy of the law to the compassion of the law, we must persist in our concern for the weak.
In addition to preventing the sale of children, it can be done better in the family and society.
For example, a common case, a family of three took a nap at the train station, only to wake up and find their child missing.
As a parent of a two-year-old, you cannot expect them to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a certain level of protection consciousness.
The parents and the child took a break to relax and enjoy the river. They also put the child under the protection of stability, which was the most effective preventive measure against child abduction.
From the perspective of the police, cracking down on illegal activities is important. But from another perspective, it is also important to pay attention to and supervise the children who are involved in the illegal activities.
Unlawful behavior of an individual is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese Criminal Law, the punishment for selling children for crime is 5 years in prison; if the situation is especially serious, the death penalty can be given, and all the criminal's assets will be confiscated.
At the height of the "light punishment" trend, selling children's crimes are clearly more serious than punishment.
There are still many shoplifting cases happening every year.
People's understanding of child rearing and education in the family is weakening, and the legal awareness is becoming shallow.
For the educational system of law, it should be synchronized and advanced together.
To effectively control illegal sales, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement of laws and regulations by the government.
If there is a wide presence of the market, the sellers will be eager to make profits and continuously innovate selling methods, thus forming a confrontational relationship with the buyers and creating a situation of low efficiency.
Therefore, it is beneficial to have a clear understanding of the law, which can help prevent and control illegal activities such as gambling and child abuse.
Comrade Yang Hongdong spoke at the Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress Spiritual Meeting of the 19th National Congress of the CPC.
Drawing power from the Party's century-long struggle history.
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee, the Propaganda Department and the Video Creation Garden of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee held an interactive dialogue in Ma'an Shan, studying the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and learning the important instructions and demonstrations of General Secretary Xi Jinping. They also studied the spirit of the 12th Provincial Committee and the 12th CPC Provincial Committee.
Coming from the three aspects of idealistic faith, initial enthusiasm and self-revolution, young people's great party and its theoretical guidance, the core spirit of the whole meeting and the practical demands, he explored the profound and shallow meanings of the whole situation.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congress, and study hard to strengthen the sense of unity and to defend the "two centers". We should also be clear about the "two defenses" in terms of both political consciousness and action. We should remain firm and unwavering in our progress.
During the interactive dialogue, the representatives of the grassroots, enterprises and young people discussed the relationship between the three historic decisions, the meaning of the "two establish" decision, how to grasp the direction of the enterprise, and how the young people of the new era can draw power from the century-long party history. Yang He, using a common language and vivid examples, answered the questions from the young party members, and firmly believed that from the party's century-long struggles, they should draw the power of advancing and tightly unite with the central leadership.

Journalists learned that the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will build an experimental platform to increase job supply, actively contact 40 universities to provide internship experience for graduates, visit enterprises to recruit one batch, and explore the “six-pack” of job opportunities, such as expanding the scope of state-owned enterprises to recruit one batch, expanding the scope of private enterprises to recruit one batch, expanding the scope of grassroots projects to recruit one batch, and actively recruiting interns to ensure that every graduate has a job opportunity. The dynamic management of “one life, one plan” will be implemented to ensure that every graduate has a job opportunity.

According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin Oil (Top Grade): It is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is pure natural product.
The fragrance of the flower is exquisite, with a gentle sweetness and a mildly sour taste.

We must continue to struggle for democracy, expressing our support for the whole society with our joint efforts.
He said: "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democracy, promote reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be able to resist the temptation of power for our own benefit and instead put the public interest first."
The second day of the National People's Congress focused on defending human rights, preserving democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital totalitarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is the "International Human Rights Day".
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democracy movement is facing a challenge on a global scale, particularly due to the new digital technology.
He said, "This is the time to uphold the shared values and standpoints as well as the democratic spirit."
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding women's and girls' opportunities.
This also requires resolute self-criticism in all its forms, including nationalism, localism and radicalism, as well as the use of all available tools provided by the technology revolution.
A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, by pre-recording a video message, to remind and keep the attention of the Council on the human rights situation of the ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: “For a long time, the world has been receiving the Chinese Communist Party’s rising, yet without establishing any mechanism to hold it accountable.”
This is why political figures and social leaders must work together.
We must utilize all the resources we possess to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task.
Luo Guanzhong also called for a united world to resist the threat of communism.
He said: "Perhaps some people in the middle are afraid of losing the Chinese market, or they don't understand the threat of the Communist Party to our democratic values.
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also one of the reasons we must change.
At the Roundtable Discussion on "Fighting Against Digital Isolation and Defending Democracy Values" held by the Taiwanese Government, the video of the "National Statement" was released, emphasizing Taiwan's stance on opposing authoritarianism and defending human rights.
He also shared his experience of how to build trust and transparency in order to effectively combat the novel coronavirus.
He said: "At the frontline of the democracy movement in Taiwan, we have remained steadfast and will continue to advance the cause of global resistance to authoritarianism."
During the pandemic period, governments with authority claimed public health and collective interests as their names, rationalized violation of citizens' rights, and retreated in the face of global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down the flag to fight fake news.
While the second day of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-U.S. summit was going on, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for severe violations of human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company for using surveillance technology to assist human rights violations.

I want to try playing basketball, but I'm afraid of myself. So I'm looking for an affordable price to practice by myself.
Unfriendly, in reality, tend to be more expensive than friendly ones, if you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap one, such "entry-level" is industrial waste.
They have very low strength, the ball can be hit to the top of the net, the vibration is very big, the hard ball can not be stopped, and it is difficult to control the powerful players.
The logic and slang of netizens are as difficult as playing a game of basketball, yet you still can't give up buying expensive things, trying to be economical, and playing around twice. This way, you won't have to worry about being broke.
You can really tell the difference between good and bad now, which means you have made progress. Come back later and I'll show you around here to buy some expensive things. I'll make two times the money.
Advising similar flowers will cost you more money, buying a used good ballpoint pen is a better option, choose Prince or Dong Rulin's, these two brands are enough without the hype, so it's still a good ballpoint pen. New one costs 500-600, used one costs 200, do you want to enjoy the luxury of a thousand-dollar pen?
Treat newcomers kindly, but once they've passed the newcomer stage, they'll be treated like regulars. However, most people, especially women, won't be able to pass the newcomer stage.

In fact, there is much to be discussed regarding the clothing and accessories worn by the petite girl with body image issues.
The girl wearing the skirt cannot be too short or too long, the difference should not be too much at the knee, and it can cover the thighs perfectly.
If the skirt is too short, it will cause the fat on the legs to be exposed.
When you are too tall, you will feel embarrassed and bloated.
If you wear different colors of clothes from top, bottom and long trousers, it will make you look taller. When you look up, you will have a sense of expansion.
In reality, many petite girls are wearing deep colors such as black, navy, and burgundy as their uniforms, which the author has deep understanding of. Deep colors are also a good way to hide their body shapes, while the high-end and elegant black skirt is their first choice.
Wearing a black short skirt will make people think you are slimmer.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear your pants and shoes too tightly, or people will notice it.
As the diversity of the crowd increases, the colors should not be too bright and flashy.
To make people feel fatigued when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For the little girl who is slightly chubby, it is important to teach her how to dress and accessorize properly.
Don't wear too tight or short skirts, it will make you look uncomfortable and unattractive. If your legs are too thick, you can wear a long black or net skirt, or a dress. Choose a soft and comfortable fabric for the skirt, and pair it with a loose-fitting blouse. This will help to hide the girl's imperfections and make her look more attractive.
Of course, the little girl was also curious about why she was wearing a short skirt.
The fat girl should choose the same color for the short skirt and the top, so that the fat girl's bulky figure will have an increase in height effect.
Wearing shorts and high heels can make your legs look longer and slimmer, which is the hottest combination for the summer!
If you are upper-body fat but have slim legs, we recommend you choose a beautiful feeling sleeveless dress.
Not only can it block out large pores, but it can also showcase your advantages.
A-shirt will make you look slim, especially if you are a chubby girl. When you wear it, make sure to choose a tight-fitting one, which will create a layered and slimming effect.
This simple white dress can be paired with shorts or tights, and it can also be tried by those who are plump.
The girl of the petite size is also able to show fashion sense.
As long as they can grasp the rules of wearing clothes and accessories, even the micro-mini girls will become the focus of attention.
After changing the way of dressing and accessorizing, we need to exercise more in life and compete to get rid of the label of "micro-shrinking" girls earlier. 😄

Girls donating money to help their sisters who were injured in an accident - New China Net.
A young girl was standing in front of a wooden board at the Hunan Forest Park. The board had the words "human flesh and blood" and "one arrow" carved on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl in Hangzhou donating money to charity with the caption “Giving is Fun” went viral on WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a tall wooden plank with the words "Human flesh and blood, one arrow" written on it. It implies that after paying a fee, one can use a bow and arrow to shoot the arrow at the wooden plank.
This behavior triggered a heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City, Xiangshan Sub-Bureau, spread the news that the person in charge of the incident had verified it to the reporters from the New China News Agency. The police confirmed that the girl had done such an impulsive and extreme act, but this behavior is not worthy of praise. After warning and admonishing her, she had already left the local police station.
A girl on the street was begging for money. She held a "arrow" in her hand, which was actually a wooden stick. She was telling people that she was injured and needed money for medical treatment.
While browsing the internet, a long-haired girl wearing a "ghost" mask stood in front of a wooden board, writing "human flesh bullet, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" in black ink. In front of her, there was another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat/Alipay numbers written.
This picture caused a controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is the "shopping for bargains" behavior of the "eyeball ball", and there are also many netizens expressing their sympathy for it.
We arrived at the square at around 10am when we noticed the situation. By then, the crowd had already dispersed.
The police station near the scene of the incident accepted the media interview of the local people, and the two girls, aged 20, were dressed up in a youthful and beautiful manner.
A girl was crying in the middle of the road, begging the people around to play the game with her. Another girl was standing beside her, helping her drink and talking about her sick sister who needs an urgent surgery fee. Please help them.
We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl is raising money for her sister, who has leukemia.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City Xiaoshan Branch informed the reporter of the New Beijing News that the girl's name is Jiaqi Li, and she is 13 years old. She donated money to her sister, who is also named Jiaqi Li.
Although the treatment still requires a lot of money, people were too busy to think of a good way to donate or contribute. Therefore, they resorted to such behavior.
He said, during the entire process, two girls were the lookouts, one responsible for holding the gun and the other one was just observing, but neither of them fired any shots. All they did was take pictures and post them on Weibo.
After the regulation of the department, the bow and arrow used by the security guards do not belong to the management scope.
The person in charge expressed that they did not advocate taking this kind of donation.
After the police warned and advised her, she had already left the police station.

What will be the hottest year in 2021?
The Beijing Olympics was without doubt.
Can only the healthy athletes win the awards?
The article "Quick Look! An Olympic Project Manager Can Crush Any Giant Brand" in the front section of the newspaper was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can always be the first to act and no one can match them in their daily routine of shifting bricks, taking risks, and working overnight. They also have the skills to save fires, bake pizzas, and face any challenges.
This article is like a funny joke, but it also reflects the daily struggles of project managers and their bitterness. It represents the true spirit of current project management work.
Employees who are involved in project management work gradually choose to release themselves from the difficulty of work through some actions.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certified professionals increases every year, more and more project management professionals are able to enhance their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the 20th Anniversary Report of China Project Management (1999-2019), the total number of people who took the PMP exam in China has reached nearly 60 million, with a pass rate of around 42 million and an effective retention rate of around 30 million, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP certification.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing steadily, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on simple and straightforward approaches can no longer bring success. The ever-changing work environment makes us realize that we need to learn and explore new paths.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can one be assured of smooth project management work without any obstacles?
Many beginner project managers expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they were able to gain a systematic understanding of project management's ten domains and five process groups, however, when it came to actually managing projects, they still felt like they were wading through a sea of fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, absence of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and workflow support, unable to keep track, unable to make accurate forecasts, lack of control and sensitivity; members are unclear about their roles and responsibilities, "old oil barrel" in the team is not clear how to address, cross-departmental communication is difficult, project progress is difficult to promote.
As a result, our focus on product innovation and development management has helped numerous excellent companies to nurture and grow their product managers and project managers, as well as to win the honor of “China’s Corporate Development Management Talent Training Base” and “Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Course”.

With confidence, you can first observe other students' evaluations of this course: This course is not only taught by the Central China-Huawei-Summer team (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines advanced project management theories and real business scenarios from renowned companies. It provides in-depth and shallow explanations of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, abundant form templates to help students convert the contents learned in class into real-world applications.

Advertisers should lead the rational consumption of consumers - Economic Observation Network － Professional Economy News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" online payment business transaction volume has reached 1.77 billion yuan, exceeding last year's record.
The Chinese government has been giving out large and generous red envelopes to stimulate consumption, leading to a surge in consumption and a boost in the economy. On the one hand, this has caused people to be more excited about national consumption and to spend more. On the other hand, it has also caused us to become more passive and to reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
Before coming to "Double 12", the company "Zhe Xin" issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the public, especially young people, to build good consumption habits and consumption skills. It refused to blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 2020 Consumer Finance Sustainability Index Report, the national consumer finance sustainability index was 66.81, higher by 2.04 than in 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese citizens in terms of financial consumption is better, but there is still a large difference in terms of financial behavior and skills. We need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
Older people and younger people have a relatively low financial literacy level, “one-child” will still be the focus of financial education. The report published by Norilsk Finance and the Central Television Finance Report 2019-2020 China Young Consumption Report shows that young people have a huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of the people do not have debt accumulation, young people have a rational consumption trend, although they present a positive consumption trend, they are still prone to excessive consumption, frivolous consumption behavior, and thus generate excessive debt pressure and risk, even causing social problems to gradually increase, financial institutions should be brave to take social responsibility, and guide in a positive direction.
As a long-term, stable financial institution, we always strive to provide quality and caring services to help people build a happy life. We advocate for consumers to establish proper and correct consumption habits, and actively respond to regulatory calls to improve the rationality of consumer behavior.
Over the past few years, we have been dedicated to promoting financial literacy among young people in China through various forms of activities, such as organizing innovation competitions, launching creative campaigns, and collaborating with top-tier universities to create a healthy consumption environment. This has helped young people to form rational consumption habits, plan their consumption demands rationally, and gradually accumulate their life wealth.
Twelve steps have been taken to reach this place. We should be aware of our consumption habits and spend our money rationally and prudently. We should also resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid taking loans to buy things that are not necessary. This will help us to safeguard our own interests and maintain a healthy economy in the future.
Consumption should be planned in advance and paid in full by the due date.
If you miss the deadline, the missed deadline record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may cause adverse effects on your future car buying and house buying activities.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also select legal institutions and channels, and check whether related institutions have the business license and qualification.
In the future, we will build a reliable and trustworthy consumption financial system and update it continuously, providing tailored services to meet the diversified needs of consumers and helping them to improve their financial knowledge and sense of moderation in borrowing. We will also help them to cultivate a rational attitude towards consumption and develop a long-term partnership with them.

The People's Daily Online - The South China Sea Cooperation Committee Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover station of the King of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, includes the countries of Aman, Al-Arab League (Arabia), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this was the first time in 2017 that the King of Mongolia, Khamaa, visited the country of Kazakhstan. This was due to the implementation of the ban on the transit of goods through the Sino-Mongolian border, which has been a source of tension in the region since then.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Palestine have broken off their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total ban on transportation, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and having a close relationship with Iran. Meanwhile, Qatar has a close relationship with Turkey.
The strained external relations have had a serious impact on the internal cohesion of the HAITIAN and have had a negative effect on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the overland, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 January meeting of the China-Pakistan Maritime Cooperation Committee in Beijing, when the two countries signed an agreement to gradually move towards “cooperation and stability”.
Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan reopened their border.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are currently working to restore their relationship with Kuwait.

It is a great addition to the hospital and will provide a calming and uplifting atmosphere for patients, staff and visitors.”
During the visit of King Salman to China, the two sides agreed to open up two sea ports between them, which is the first direct land road passage.
The 725-km-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of the two countries' citizens.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in the United Arab Emirates, and the two countries' companies have signed a memorandum of understanding worth $300 billion.
The Islamic Republic of Iran and the world's major powers, including China, have been negotiating a joint comprehensive action plan (JCPOA) to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.
Each coastal country has always seen Iran as a long-term rival and perceived Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country in the region considered the issue of Iran's missile activities as a problem that could not be resolved, and failed to take any action to contain Iran's activities in the region. This was a dangerous weakness.
In the wake of the failure of the talks between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program, Saudi Arabia and Iran have begun direct negotiations.
The goal is to upgrade the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the growth of national economy in the Pearl River Delta.
The first meeting of the Conference on the Law of the Sea will be held in Cancun, Mexico, from November 29 to December 3, 1982, to end the long-standing disputes between some member states and Costa Rica.
This is an opportunity to promote the unity of the East Asian community and to make a contribution to the recovery of the East Asian cooperation process. At the same time, various measures should be proposed to ensure the full cooperation of the member states, to tackle common challenges, and to promote the stability and development of the East Asian countries.

The sound of people running in the New Mountain District was the loudest!
This car we brought for you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the car is near two hundred million yuan, and the road tax for one year is about ten thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because you have the power of 700 horses, can you imagine how fast it can be?
Even the editor doesn't know, the data says that it needs 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is roughly the same as myvi's 30km/h speed.
The low-slung car seat, the sharply creased scissor-door, the pervasive sense of grandeur emanating from the cavernous intake, and the final touch of glass-swathed refinement - all of these elements have come together to perfectly articulate the essence of Land Rover's design language.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much. Just Google it and you'll find some explanations. We've organized some of the Google results that may not be accurate.
Everyone is watching the same thing, but it's so interesting that no one wants to look away! (It's kind of cool!)
It's about 1km to the petrol station and it costs about RM1 (or less) for the car owner (no matter how much they care).
The posture and movement of the car should be practiced regularly, otherwise it will be stiff and difficult to start. (Because it will be stuck halfway when entering the car cabin.)
The sound of the engine was too loud, so I had to turn down the volume of my ears after getting off the car. (But it was still very comfortable.)
The car was too big, so it had to stop at the parking lot. Unfortunately, it was too narrow and it was afraid of being hit by the other cars when the gate opened.
There was a bit of loneliness because there was no one on the road (I was talking to the driver, nothing to do with the car).
Don't make mistakes, this video's super fast and it doesn't have to be sold, sorry!

Allowing University Spirit and Spirit of the Times to Resonate in Unison - China News Network
The spirit of a university is to form a series of long-term accumulation of hard work and values ​​seeking, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been an important factor in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, and has made important contributions to the progress of a nation.
From the first modern university in the world, the University was born with a unique mission and spirit, different from other social organizations. For the University, the rise of the national crisis was the beginning of its glorious history. Its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the values of "righteousness, harmony and peace" and "strengthening the nation" with a patriotic love for the country.
The trend of internationalization and informatization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, leading to fierce global education competition, technology competition and human resource competition. This provides the higher education industry with a great opportunity and challenge.
The proposal of "Integrated Plan for Building a World-Class University and World-Class Academic Disciplines" in the Report on China's Progress in Higher Education was to demonstrate the country's determination and resolve to make progress in higher education, and to put forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How can we rapidly build a world-class university and world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap between us and the world's top universities and disciplines? How can we achieve the "Fast Track" of "Supercar" in the shortest possible time?
In addition to believing in the target, path and ability, college should also fully play the three advantages: first, the post-harvest advantage, through continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from abroad, to learn advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement of academic level and quality assurance; second, the cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years, to spread the excellent traditional culture, to create a powerful brand and image; third, the institutional advantage, to make full use of the superior system of socialist country, to strengthen the motivation of the target, to accumulate the consensus and strength, to optimize the resource arrangement, to provide a solid guarantee for the rapid progress of the school.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that building a world-class university requires the presence of multiple campuses, each of which should highlight its own advantages and characteristics.
China's special feature is that it must have both a collective spirit and individual uniqueness. It must manifest its own tradition and resources, as well as its own target positioning and study of the traditional.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we should pay attention to three aspects of its features: first, it emphasizes the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, and builds an integrated education and business environment to form a complete value chain of entrepreneurial education; second, it actively adjusts the optimization of the academic system, creating a favorable institutional environment for the cross-border gathering of disciplines, and actively cultivating interdisciplinary and signature cross-border achievements; third, it emphasizes the construction of an all-round service system and social service system, and actively promotes in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, accelerating the formation of a comprehensive and collaborative production and research system.
During this process, it is especially important to remain steadfast in university spirit, so that the university spirit can be in harmony with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the core values of "seeking innovation", "hard work", "moral integrity", and "practical wisdom" form a new system of understanding and expression. The spirit of "opening up, awakening, and cultivating the people" and "building a strong and prosperous nation" is the latest description of the university's spirit.
This is a school that has been persisting in the correct direction of study, accumulating culture and spiritual intensity, and protecting it with great importance. It is abundant and profound in meaning.
The first emphasis is to open up and embrace a spirit of inclusiveness, manifesting in the pride of being a "world-class university" for nurturing talents. The second emphasis is to pursue excellence and integrity, exemplified by the perseverance of Tao Xingzhi and Liu Heng in their pursuit of truth and moral integrity. The third emphasis is to innovate and reform, encompassing both knowledge-seeking and technological innovation, as well as a commitment to national revitalization.
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit, is the soul of Zhejiang University 120 years of study.
Sages hear the sound of silence, and seers behold the unseen.
China's higher education should seize the opportunity to further consolidate its position in the global market, and deepen its understanding of the historical mission and burden of the higher education industry. This will accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should guard the humanistic spirit of independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times interact with each other, and thus provide inexhaustible energy for the realization of national strength and ethnic revival, and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

The maximum duration of the leave for entrepreneurship of college students in Guangxi can reach 5 years.
The Ministry of Education recently announced that all schools in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will adopt a flexible learning system.

I saw some news about the stock price of my friend's company, and the greatest feeling I had was the choice of the industry they had made - investing in the stock market. Firstly, they had to choose a large growing industry, with a market size of at least 1000 billion yuan; secondly, they had to choose a future-oriented industry, considering the potential growth of the industry in the next 3-5 years; finally, they had to choose an industry that was sustained by policies.
The market scale is the scope of the race track, the industry's development stage is the length of the race track, the race track is flat or mountain-like the industry's competitive landscape.

In 2021, the Bitcoin price will experience several milestones, such as the 12th birthday of the cryptocurrency.
On September 7th, the small countries of Samara and Vatado declared Bitcoin as their official currency, making it the first time Bitcoin has become a legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12th, 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, marking the first time a cryptocurrency ETF was approved for listing on a US stock exchange.

From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.

A group of ethnic minority students from Yunnan Province filed a lawsuit against the East China Normal University for discrimination.
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice Department, protesting the discriminatory admissions processes of three universities - University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University - in their recruitment of students.
The Asian American Education Union held a news conference in Washington D.C. on the same day to launch a complaint against the head of the Chinese Embassy.
The Asian American student population at three top-tier universities in the United States has grown exponentially over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian Americans at these universities has remained largely the same.
Research has shown that these universities in the so-called "holistic admissions" process of recruitment, "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants.
Zhao Yukun introduced the research of 2014 Stanford scholars which showed that the rate of Asian applicants admitted to the three universities was the lowest among all racial and ethnic groups.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all the California Colleges and Universities in the CAMPUS Consortium, Berkeley and UCLA have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, while UCLA and UC Berkeley have been practicing race-based affirmative action for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told the reporters from the Chinese Embassy in the United States that they hoped the U.S. Department of Education and Justice could open an investigation and take necessary measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian Americans after the fact was confirmed.
They also hoped that the school would take an active role in addressing this issue, and change its recruitment policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three schools being sued have yet to respond.
The Alliance for Equal Education was established in 2015, when it had filed a lawsuit against Harvard University for discriminating against Asian applicants. However, the U.S. Department of Education had rejected the lawsuit for procedural reasons.
This includes participants from the Chinese American, Indian American, Korean American, and Filipino American communities, as well as organizations representing the education of other Asian American ethnicities such as Hmong, Vietnamese, and Indonesian Americans.

In September 2020, Mr. Li from the house agency learned about a factory building located in Zhejiang Yunyang Town. After multiple visits to the site, Mr. Li decided to purchase the factory building.
On the same day, Mr. Liu purchased a house and signed the contract with the seller. After that, they negotiated the details of the house and the ownership of the house. Finally, they transferred the money through the bank and the deposit was 20 million yuan.
Lin Xiaojun signed as the collector on the contract of buying and selling the factory, with the contents "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties should sign the contract within one week."
However, after discussing the scope of payment, the two sides could not reach a consensus on the major terms of the contract, leading to a delay in signing the agreement.
After considering for several days, Lingbao finally returned 20 million yuan to Lu Peng.
It was difficult to see the house in the middle of China, but the money was exchanged, the deposit was also ready, and then it was just a matter of signing the contract, but the buyer did not sell, which made the seller feel helpless and angry.
In order to do this, Luo Xinsheng brought a lawsuit against Liu Yongxin in the People's Court of Yucheng City.
The court held that both parties failed to sign a formal contract, and thus could not hold the other party solely responsible. It was decided that the case could not be applied to a fine and the defendant was not required to pay back double the amount. The plaintiff was relieved of any responsibility.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff initiated an appeal.
The Supreme People's Court recently maintained the original verdict.
[Lawyer's Warning] In the trading process, you should be prudent and cautious to the utmost extent.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should be prudent and attentive to the duties, such as verifying the ownership information of the house, whether the house has been occupied by people, and clearly specify the time and place of delivery in the contract, to avoid any disputes between the two sides.
After the conclusion of the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao held a press conference on Saturday, December 11th, and stated that the United States had organized the "Leading People's Conference" which was "to institutionalize the idea of democracy, to weaponize democracy, to stage a fake democracy, to incite internal conflict".
The Chinese government regards the United States' long-term efforts to change its political system and value orientation as an attempt to weaken its foundation, promote "color revolutions" and unilateral sanctions, and cause disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has already become the United States's interference in other countries' 'large-scale killing weapons'.
This time, the summit was to show the commitment of the candidates in the election.
The meeting was to be held for two days and was to be conducted via video, with 111 global leaders invited, including Taiwan's leadership, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the SCO summit, China and Russia accused the United States of interfering with the SCO summit and denounced the United States for lacking the qualification to host such a summit.
There are also suspicions of ulterior motives in the international arena, such as criticism of invitation and participation of some authoritarian leaders, e.g. from Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubt the true intention of the government is not for democracy but for geopolitical purpose of organizing this summit.
The German Federal Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen also attended the video-conference of the People's Forum.
The statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, June 1, 2019, titled "Today's Western-style Democracy Is Exposed, Such as Capitalism, Personality Politics, Radicalism, Political Extremism, Social Fracture, and Inter-Ethnic Conflict" is a "Wealthy People's Playground" in the United States.
President Xi Jinping stated in his speech that as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, and resist the encroachment of authoritarianism and special interests. We must also be able to resist the powerful forces of centralization and bureaucracy.
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation, in my view, this is our generation's defining challenge."
After bowing, he continued to speak, "The challenge of global democracy and human rights is a daunting one, and democracy needs its defenders to protect it."
The United States has promised to open up a year of action after the 2020 Democratic National Convention, including a proposal of $4.244 billion in funding to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
Before the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Chinese government made a public commitment to improve its democracy system in order to ensure a successful hosting of the event.
We pledge to work tirelessly to make good on our commitments and to report back on the progress we have made by next year.
He was so kind that he only feared that he had sent the wrong address.

Thoughts on Education: How to Make University Examinations Easier for “Examination Superstars” and “Examination Disasters”?The Chinese education system has been undergoing a period of reform and adjustment in recent years. The focus of education has shifted from rote memorization to problem-solving and critical thinking. This has led to a new phenomenon of “examination superstars” and “examination disasters”. Examination superstars are students who have a natural talent for exams and can easily achieve high scores. On the other hand, examination disasters are students who struggle with exams and often receive low scores.In order to make university examinations easier for both examination superstars and examination disasters, it is important to adjust the examination structure and assessment criteria. Examination superstars should be given more challenging questions that require higher-level thinking, while examination disasters should be given simpler questions that require less thinking. This will help to create a more balanced examination environment.In addition, it is important to provide more resources and support for examination disasters. This
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school administration, expressing their frustration with the difficulty of the university entrance exam and proposing measures to make the exam more challenging and transform the test type so that it can truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
For a long time, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" in China.
At the university campus, students from the five lakes and four seas come with different abilities and levels of study. The situation is varied and incomparable.
For a group with such diversity of features, there will be different feelings, and it is difficult to avoid.
Of course, if the test is too simple and repetitive, the experience will be completely different.
Students who don't use their strengths may be able to achieve good results by focusing on their studies right before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may be able to get better results with half the effort.
When you come here, you will find yourself in a dilemma. On one hand, you have to invest a lot of effort and time to achieve success. On the other hand, you have to put in a lot of effort to get good grades. This is because the amount of effort required to achieve success is much higher than the amount of effort required to get good grades.
As it appears, the students of Lanzhou University who took the college entrance examination reflected the problems existing in the examination. However, this is not the only case in Lanzhou University.
From this layer of meaning, we should write a congratulatory letter to the three students who passed the exam.
In reality, many people who have passed university have become clear about how to prepare for the exam, seek various methods from teachers to "extract" questions, compete to narrow the exam range, and even seek "precious guidance" during the examination. Furthermore, during the examination, some people even carry small notes and seek the help of teachers after the examination. This is not a rare phenomenon.
As seen from the perspective of an examiner, the assessment of teaching quality is a directional measure, with the evaluation of student compliance and the comprehensive grasp of teachers on both teaching and learning as the basis. Furthermore, the scientific design of examinations is also based on this.
Entering the university's undergraduate stage, specialization begins, with many specialty courses focusing on the basics.
Doubtfulness is not a suitable attitude when it comes to grasping the basic knowledge points of a certain subject, which is an important content of university exams.
In essence, the knowledge of a college student is based on scientific principles and basic knowledge, which is relatively fixed from the perspective of knowledge.
Just like what the teacher said 20 years ago, "The basic knowledge of mathematics is still the focus now."
Although knowledge points are basic and unchanged, it does not represent a test type or a test repeated.
At many universities, exams are usually composed of a group of questions, and then the questions are collated and put into an exam paper by a subject-specialist teacher. The exam paper is then marked by a group of teachers from the same subject, so that the problem of exam paper duplication can be overcome to some extent.
However, the test should be designed to cover a variety of topics related to the actual teaching and learning situation, with difficulty levels ranging from easy to difficult, and should also take into account the comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, in order to make the test dynamic and discerning. It should be able to highlight the basic knowledge and skills of the students, as well as their abilities. In addition, it should also be innovative in its design.
Examinations are the commanding rod of university education, with what kind of examinations students will have corresponding preparation plans, and this will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the advice letter to the students, the Lanzhou University has highly valued and has already implemented the reform plan in the whole campus.
All educational units should organize teachers to conduct seminars and examinations, formulate examination questions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and examination of examination questions and evaluation of results.
To solve the problem of single-type, repetitive questions in university entrance exams, a comprehensive system is needed, but the expertise is expensive and time-consuming. Teachers should have a full understanding of the learning environment and be able to interact with students in a positive way. This will help to create a better atmosphere for learning and make the exam more realistic, thus reducing the pressure of “studying for the sake of exam” and “studying for the sake of grades”.

The bride and groom had their wedding photos taken at the South Street Store. However, there is no store division yet.
Because we didn't plan the time well in advance, we had to change the time twice and the photographer was very patient with us.
After selecting a good weather weekend to take pictures.
The staff of the gold couple's work are praised by all, regardless of whether they are consultants, beauticians or photographers.
That was my first official makeover, wow! I was so scared, but one day I'll definitely look that good, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super gentle when it comes to makeup. They also do it very naturally.
We were lucky to have good weather when we were shooting the scenery in the Yangtze River City. The makeup artist was always mindful of our clothing, headwear and accessories, and would adjust them whenever necessary.
The photographer was also very quiet, and felt very happy when taking pictures for a whole day.
When choosing photos for an album, due to seeing many examples online, I didn't want to delete too many photos, but when we were actually choosing photos, there was no thought of adding more photos. We just chose 24 photos and moved on. I was shocked when I heard that the package included one million photos and I was scared that I had chosen too many.
Today, the picture was finished and Lanlan gave it to me. I looked at it and felt it wasn't good enough, so they helped me to re-modify it immediately.
I compared the old photos of my sisters taken before with the new ones I took, and I feel our photos are much better now - simpler, clearer and more stylish.
Recommend everyone to go and take a look at the Shrine of the Golden Man in Xuanzhou!
The price of the package is 3999 yuan.
Wish you all a happy and prosperous life, like a bright and beautiful carpet!

3200 newborns in Shaanxi Province were found to have been given fake vaccination certificates.
(As reported by Xinhua on October 11th) The Registration Office of the People's Republic of Bangladesh said that due to the special feature of the fake currency and counterfeit goods storage, they have been unable to send birth certificates to newborns since October, and the accumulated affected people have reached 3200.
Despite the fact that Caitlyn Amnesia Nurses had promised to provide fake documents for all the babies who had applied for a birth certificate, the records had already been recorded in the system. When the fake papers arrived the following week, they would be supplemented.
He appeared at the news release meeting, addressing the issue of a website media for more than 10 months and made an explanation.
He said the problem appeared two months ago and he had to face the same issue.
One of the reasons was that Chinese factories producing counterfeit paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed shipments to our country.
He explained, Sabao used paper for counterfeiting and other regions were different, so it couldn't borrow other states' storage.
Quentin Amis revealed the latest batch of fake papers on June 6th, and the printing process was completed on June 8th and handed over to the printing company for partial printing work.

The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly evaluated the economic and social development achievements of the past year in China.

We celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party with pride and officially declare the completion of the socialist new-democratic China, and strive for the first centenary goal. We also open up a new journey of comprehensive building of socialism and modernizing the nation.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, summarizing the Party's great achievements and historic experience over the past 95 years, and formulating the third historic decision of the Party, "On the Great Achievements and Historic Experience of the Party Over the Past 95 Years". This is a political declaration of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the experience of the Party's long-term struggle, to continue to adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to create a great modern socialist country.
In one year, the world has not seen such great changes in the epidemiological and environmental situation, and the new coronavirus infection has become more and more complex and severe. The task of prevention and control, as well as economic and social development, is extremely arduous.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been adhering to the core values of Xi Jinping, persisting in the overall stability of the two major issues of the country and the world, and striving for steady progress in the overall situation of the nation. It has been tenaciously fighting against the changing situation of the past century and the epidemic, and has been actively adjusting and optimizing the economic and social development. It has been striving to build a new development framework, strengthening macroeconomic policies across generations, and actively promoting innovation, deepening reform, and achieving remarkable achievements in the reform and opening up. The party and the country have achieved remarkable successes in various undertakings.
Implementing good starting conditions realized, an important aspect of it was displayed, constructing a new developmental framework and taking new steps forward achieved a new efficiency.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control has maintained the leading position in the world, with strong, robust and dynamic characteristics continuously displayed; the country's strategic technology strength has been accelerated, major breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of innovation, and the technology innovation capacity has been constantly improved; the industrial chain has been strengthened, exports have been enriched, and structural optimization has been continuously optimized, representing a new growth momentum; the reform and opening up has been deepened, and obstacles to the supply-side structural adjustment and the flow of resources have been broken, creating a new competitive advantage; social security has been strengthened, employment has been expanding, and income growth has been synchronized with economic growth, achieving "double first-class" results; environmental protection has been effectively implemented, and the employment rate has been steadily increasing, with the annual grain harvest continuously staying above 1.3 billion tons, achieving "double first-class" results. China's ecological civilization construction has been continuously promoted, carbon emissions have been reduced, and the low-carbon transformation has been steadily advanced
The achievements of these scores are the result of the core of the Party Central Committee led by General Secretary Xi Jinping, the result of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism and the scientific guidance of the Party Central Committee. It is the unity of the whole Party and the whole country, the hard work and dedication of the people of all ethnic groups.
Practice again proved, the Party firmly established the core and the central position of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. It also established Xi Jinping's new era of China's socialism with Chinese characteristics. This has great significance for the development of the Party and the state. It is also of great importance to the promotion of the great cause of the Chinese nation.
With Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the Party has achieved great successes in uniting the Party, the country and the people. With Comrade Xi Jinping's new century of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party has provided scientific guidance for the people of all ethnic groups to unite as one, become strong and brave in struggle, and create a brilliant future for the nation.
The 20th National Congress of the CPC will be held next year, which is a major event in the life of the Party and the country.
Spread the great spirit of the party, persist in the steady and rigorous work style, and constantly advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Perfect, accurate, and comprehensive implementation of the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, quicken the pace of reform and opening up, and promote the modernization of the Party and the country. Strictly control the epidemic and effectively maintain social stability. Continuously improve the quality of economic development, and strive to achieve the "six steady" and "six secure" work.

We will definitely be able to maintain a steady and healthy economic environment, social stability, and a clean and healthy political environment, and achieve outstanding results in the 20th National Congress of the Party.
Let us tightly unite around the core of Xi Jinping Thought and strengthen the four consciousnesses, four self-confidences, and two defenses. We should constantly enhance our political judgement, political expertise, and political execution, so as to turn the Party Central Committee’s decisions into real actions and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The State Council has required strengthening the prevention and control of epidemic and endangering the stability of the border cities.

According to the notice, the time range for the requirements specified in the notice is from March 15th, 2021 to March 14th, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed to study the conditions of the coastal cities and set up the prevention and control of the epidemic buffer zone within the administrative area.

In fact, the material of the pouch and the earring is the same, without any difference.
Why is the warranty period of a bag with a detachable lining longer than two years, while the warranty period of a bag with a non-detachable lining is only one year?
Why is the price of the two so different?
In fact, many consumers, or even mothers' grade, think that the quality is different because of the material, so it is very good.
The reality is the same as the original material, only that people think expensive is good.
Consumers who have this kind of mindset will have different reactions after eating or drinking. For example, some may feel a different kind of taste or smell.
Now I'm going to tell you the reason why wearing expensive things is considered to be luxurious. Where is it considered to be luxurious?
Why are the prices of their materials so different?
Because most factories consider the price of the product when setting the price, consumers find it difficult to accept, which means that factories will generate low profits or even suffer losses. What can factories do to survive?

Therefore, most of the factories are promoting the listening earphone rather than the pouch.
Advertising costs for factories each year can range from a few thousand yuan to even tens of millions of yuan. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine and know.
As society develops, marketing costs are constantly increasing. For example, the cost of promotional staff in shopping centres, the cost of listing fees for products, and advertising costs are all increasing continuously.
Therefore, each factory is constantly introducing new products, and the prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is due to the increasing cost of marketing.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan.
There is still a portion of the brand, in order to promote their own products, without hesitation, accompanied by hospital doctors to help product promotion, from listening to earn 30 yuan to 80 yuan profit.

When browsing books in a bookstore, you can often feel the excitement of successive books of different genres.
Many successful books and articles today are based on the "best practices" principle — they assume you can "do it" and then tell you what to do.
Equal to saying a few words about the most important and fundamental circle.
Since they all have this common trait — — either they are pumped up with enthusiasm and work hard until the best result is achieved, or they are lazy and do nothing, or they are 100% or 0%, or you may climb the Mount Tai, or you may just wait around doing nothing.
This kind of "best practice" will make everyone admit "correct without comparison", but 99% of people will be fooled and run at the starting line.
Because this kind of thinking can be described as a "you must suffer to reach your goals, rebuild yourself, and make a 180 degree turnaround", it is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who adhere to the traditional rules, persist in the old habits, and reject change, you will always be at their ear whispering, "You have to change." Without doubt, this is an act of self-aggrandizement and provocation against the ox.
Most people will be hesitant before the two faces of "change", feeling helpless and afraid; or they may be bold enough to take the first step, but eventually it will be a short-lived success, and they will fall into the same trap again and again.

Whatever you do, it will be better than nothing.
Due to the decrease in the severity of the door knob, the possibility of ordinary people to persist indefatigably has increased, and thus the probability of success will also be enhanced.
Only by following the "successful principle" can we achieve success. The road is long and winding, so it has already been extended.
Although it may seem like a good principle to have a successful flag that inspires everyone, in reality it can only motivate a few. However, the “second good principle” can effectively inspire more people and make more people benefit.

The amount of resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake will increase by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 11.4%. - Xinhua Net
The latest survey results show that the amount of Qinghai Lake's resources has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, which is 40 times more than the amount in 2002.
The famous fish species "Sinking Fish" in the Qinghai Lake is a special fish in the lake, which has important functions in the ecosystem of the Qinghai Lake water-fish-bird chain.
During the 60s and 70s of the 20th century, human activities such as large-scale fishing, overfishing, and uncontrolled breeding of aquatic animals had a great impact on the environment of the Qinghai Lake, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of the lake's fish resources. In 2002, the total amount of fish resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Red Data Book listed the Qinghai Lake Monster as an endangered species.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has been implementing the ban on fishing in the Qinghai Lake and its surrounding river and tributaries, as well as prohibiting any unit, group or individual from catching, buying or selling the fish and its products.
Meanwhile, we should also take measures such as increasing the flow of rivers and streams, clearing the Qinghai Lake, designing a scientific and rational fishway, and continuously enhancing the protection force to increase the resources of Qinghai Lake.
This is an introduction to the agricultural and rural villages in Qinghai Province, China. It has been implemented since 1985, with a total investment of 1.8 billion yuan. The contribution rate of Qinghai Lake Rural Development Project to the resource recovery of Qinghai Lake is over 23%.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Three River Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source in China, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and functional area that helps to slow down the westward expansion of the desert.
In order to protect the Three Gorges, Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau ecosystems, the water and wildlife of the area, the government has been issuing warnings about the Long River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake Special Protection Areas since 2018. This has resulted in the construction of a comprehensive ban on fishing and hunting in the area.

After ensuring good health of the body, one can compare the monthly cycle more regularly.
But it is not the law of the land to the point of accuracy, roughly a week apart, need to prepare in advance, the mood of the difference may also be flipped (suddenly prepared in advance for several days).
The severity of time, space, and pain is different for each person; some people need three days, some people need one week; some people have little blood, some people have a lot of blood loss; some people have no reaction, some people are in great pain; the pain will change with time, and it does not represent the same person's pain.
During the 24 hours within which the full moon is at its peak, the only thing one can do is to use a sanitary napkin or a piece of clean cloth to stop the bleeding and prevent it from reaching the clothes.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins, which begins right before your period and peaks during your period. Eating brunch can help relieve the cramps, but there's not much else you can do after the cramps have started.
Due to excessive release of blood and prostaglandins before menstruation, it is easy to get a cramp in the abd Home » News » News » 2018 » The Future of Transportation is ElectricThe Future of Transportation is ElectricThe future of transportation is electric.

If you reach the period, it's impossible to hide your belly, so you'd better come to the clinic as soon as possible.
The best time to change a sanitary napkin is every three to four hours. Otherwise, it is easy to get a yeast infection, and it is not advisable to sleep with a sanitary napkin for more than one night. If you are prepared in advance, you can have up to 50 pieces per month.

During the full moon and the period of menstruation, the chance of experiencing strong emotions is higher, and the mood may be unstable due to hormonal changes. This can be very overwhelming, and it can be difficult to take care of yourself.

After the conclusion of the monthly ritual, the inner membrane of the child's room became thin, and then slowly became thick. This can be understood as the child's room is a house, and each month is prepared to receive guests (the inner membrane becomes thick). If there is no guest, it will be demolished (the monthly ritual is performed) and a new house will be built in the next month.
The monthly cycle is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with each month lasting 24 hours of bleeding and abdominal pain and cramps. Who would want to go through this?
However, people are able to be born due to their mother's hard work during the month of pregnancy, which is to prepare for their first visit to this world. We should thank our mother for their hard work and healthy pregnancy.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed by society, which portrayed them as lewd and shamed them. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that preparing for pregnancy and childbirth is evil, they shouldn't say it out loud in public. Instead, the girls should stand up, they have never experienced it before and the boy will never go through it.

Is your electricity bill too high because of your feet?
Choosing the suitable foot bath can bring you good health effects. Today, the National Beauty Small Editor will make a solution to this problem, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness has been strengthened, the popularity of foot baths has been increasing rapidly. On the market, a variety of products ranging from a few dozen yuan to thousands of yuan have been presented, providing consumers with a great selection space.
On related data tables, compared with traditional home appliances, the health care-related home appliances such as sauna bags have seen a rapid growth in sales, but sauna bags lack special industry standards, resulting in a certain safety hazard.
In the water with electricity, it's really dangerous!
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his parents' birthday, but his parents felt uncomfortable when they took a bath.
When Mr. Li first started using the vibrating function of the bath tub, he didn't expect it to cause such a stir. He was shocked when the vibrating function was suddenly turned off and he felt a strange sensation in his feet. His father said it was like a massage.
Mr. Li tried using an electric brush, but to his surprise, the brush lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to find that the water in the bathtub was carrying electricity.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had to give up the massage chair and the sauna. Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that the old and popular foot bath which was set in the highest temperature nowadays has no clear industry standard in terms of application, population and material safety.
However, in general, a bathroom with a bathtub will not have any electrical problems, but it also does not exclude some products from the factory that do not have strict quality control.
Therefore, when purchasing a massage chair, choose a foot bath basin with separate parts.
Separating water and electricity can cause no safety hazards.

Ding Zi Liang: Zhi You Ren.
Throughout the 30 years since the disaster, my family and I have been deeply grateful for the unconditional help from all of you. In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those who have been providing continuous assistance since 1994 when I issued a public appeal for help. Your help has never been interrupted.
Most elderly parents who encountered difficulties in life have already passed away, leaving their lonely children to grow up and find jobs.
You have been so kind and helpful to us during the most difficult time.
The current novel coronavirus pandemic has spread to every corner of the globe, with the vast majority of donors having already exhausted their annual leave.
Therefore, I humbly request you to kindly stop giving us hard time——the Mothers of the Motherland in Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian rescue activity should be started as soon as possible.
I will forever engrave your love in my heart and your justice will be forever etched in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to use this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the International Federation for China Social Services (IFCSS) and the Minority Development Fund (MCDF).
During the process of engaging in human rights assistance, the China Democracy and Human Rights Fund and the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association are parallel organizations, with project implementers often having to cross paths.

Money cannot buy happiness.
In 1994, Ding Lǎo Tè taught us to establish a special group to collect and distribute funds for rescuing and helping people in need.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Sixth-Fourth Widowed and Orphaned Children Education Fund" and has been executing it for 11 years. In 2009, the MCDF established the "Sixth-Fourth Widowed and Orphaned Elderly Emergency Housing Assistance Fund" and has been executing it until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from the donations made by the alumni and the public after the June 4th Incident in 1989, as well as from the generous contributions of individuals. The Democratic Progressive Party also provided support.
From 2018 onwards, we have received the support of the China Scholarship Council.
After 31 years, the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the event.
During this period, "China People's Rights" also carried out its humanitarian rescue projects independently.
We understand that Ding Teacher called for a stop to the 64 donation, considering the donors, we are indeed some retired people with limited income, so we express our gratitude to Ding Teacher.
We will respect the decision of the hard-hit people and terminate this project within two years. We will also restore it as soon as possible when needed.
For those who have been enduring great pain and suffering for many years, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our deepest gratitude and respect.

However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a good choice, especially for those with self-motivation and weaknesses. Training is a great choice for them.
If you are strong enough to self-motivate, you can choose to study on your own. However, it will be quite tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the teacher's qualifications of this institution. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions also do not have particularly strong teacher qualifications.
Before selecting this training institution, it is advisable to explore it in detail. Knowing the students of this institution can give a better idea of what it is like. After all, only the students of this institution can tell us what it is really like. Furthermore, the course offered by the institution can be assessed as good or bad.
Hi, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your personal situation. There is a big connection between learning this thing and personal situation.
For example, if you are interested in a specific profession, age, or language, you may want to study or pursue a career related to it, such as in a certain city.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many online and offline training institutions that are not bad, but it requires a high investment of time and money, and it also requires a concentrated training of 3-6 months.
However, if it is my situation, self-study is very convenient.

It works to increase access to the arts, support artists and arts organisations,
There are also some classic books which can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can still afford to pay certain tuition fees and time costs, then it is advisable to attend a training institution and learn. This way of learning is not very tiring, and the teachers explain in great detail. There are also people who specialize in answering questions, and in addition, there is help in planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training institutions will sign a job agreement with you, with an internal recommendation bonus and referral to companies after the study, which can greatly reduce the job interview process.
This is my opinion, which is based on my limited understanding of your situation. I have only briefly described it, so if you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I saw 1 point before I arrived, I saw it in the App.

You haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
Our company provides a variety of services, such as installation, cleaning, maintenance, wall hanging, clothes dryer, air conditioner, trash can, furnace, and oil burner. We also specialize in sewing and home appliances.

Life is like this, people only see the results, you have to go through the process yourself, facing life, we are strong and continue, there is no choice, the road can only turn back and not walk away……
Keeping clean is work, also a responsibility, living beautifully through service, service through using heart, making it colorful.
Although our cleaning job was the dirtiest one, we still did it with the most serious attitude. We scrubbed every corner of the house until it was sparkling clean. When the customer saw our satisfied smile and proudly raised thumb, all the tiredness was worth it. We got the reward in the end!
My Daily Work
I am here to fulfill your requirements.
Use your heart to serve, use your heart to clean, keep a beautiful home.
Pay attention to the details of your life, and I will help you achieve the "perfection" I am capable of. Serve your family with love.
Keep the house clean and neat, plant trees to make it more beautiful, provide services at the right place, and keep the house clean.
Cleaning both inside and outside of the house is my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp was beautiful, it would become dull and dim after a long time without being cleaned, and could only be brightened up again after being cleaned. Life is also like this.
With heart we can do anything successfully, with meticulousness we can create masterpieces, and with sincerity we are determined.
Give me a chance and I will make sure you are satisfied with the quality, as a professional it deserves to be trusted, and your recognition will be my greatest motivation!
Everything is not going well down there!
Nevertheless, I will always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, persistence, and effort, I will be better than others, at least a little bit! Let's keep trying!
Calculations begin at dawn, bringing all good things from the start of the clear morning. May you take joy, luck, health and fulfillment on this new day, and keep a positive attitude throughout. Good night.
In the past, happiness was a thing to be possessed, so people strived for it. As they grew older, they realized that happiness is a state of mind, and mastering it made them happy.
Strive to be the most authentic and virtuous version of yourself, walk with courage and no regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life is composed of two treasures: a healthy body and a clear mind, shining brightly until old age!
Each stage of life brings its own unique challenges.
At many times, your determination was not your ability, but rather your positive attitude and courage.
Since you cannot escape, it is better to face it bravely.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated; the more you face difficulty, the more you will be entangled. But if you welcome difficulty and rise up, the problem will eventually be cut down and resolved.

Second, although the Rightists had a short-lived glory in history, it was due to the fact that they exposed themselves to the sunlight and drank the water, which made them sweat profusely; thus, they were easily defeated and crushed by the powerful forces of the State.
Although the real situation is still far from satisfactory, the right-wing has made positive contributions to the social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, the true meaning of reality should be defined and standards set for economic growth, technological progress and political system reform and human rights protection. The positive meaning of the right-wing should not be denied.
Although I don't agree with everything Li Weidong says, I'm very interested in his views, and very respectful of him as a person. This is because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere in his views on Chinese social issues.
But I oppose his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe revolution is inevitable, which will lead to social turmoil, people's suffering, and political instability, thus becoming a puppet of foreign powers.
Four, changing or improving China requires patience and taking responsibility as a citizen, political plots are doomed to fail, it is a mixture of heterogeneous elements.
Let's chat some more.
Left, in reality, is a remnant of the era and politics.
If the right has positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts at times of need. Then the left will have nothing to do, because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away.
I recently saw some of my friends looking sad and angry, and they also seemed to be feeling unwell. I thought they might not need my help.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all just a bunch of nonsense.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't want to admit that we are wrong. Why do we need to?
I tell my friends this way: When people insult you for five inches, when they make fun of your left leg, it proves our middle path is correct!

For the past two years, the US has been restricting and obstructing the sales of Huawei's products, not only putting Huawei into a worse situation than ever before, but also causing immense losses to "American-system" companies.
The U.S. imperialism has been exerting pressure on China's semiconductor industry, requiring domestic enterprises and alliance members to simultaneously lock down the Chinese semiconductor industry, resulting in global chip supply chain disruption, reducing chip production and chip capacity, and causing global chip supply chain disorder.
Now "chip shortage" has already spread to the global major industries, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price hikes, almost all industries using chips have been severely affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-authority, more and more countries' technology giants began to walk the "China-ization" road.
In order to tightly control the global semiconductor industry, the US is pulling the strings of the Chinese semiconductor industry's development, recently inviting the US to host the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish the Semiconductor Alliance. Meanwhile, it is also trying to bribe the US domestic giant technology companies, such as Intel, to regain its dominance in the chip field. To this end, it has invested 200 million US dollars in the US state of Arizona to build two wafer fabs. It has also opened up the chip foundry business to foreign companies.
Most people regard it as a game, but in fact it is a serious matter that could cause a great deal of damage to Taiwan's power grid and even lead to the "capture of the "dish"".
This is because Intel, the old giant in the semiconductor industry, has been investing in the Chinese market for decades and has accumulated a large number of talents and technological reserves, which must ensure its rapid rise and defeat Taiwan in a short period of time.
However, regarding Intel's decision, Taiwan's chip pioneer Zhang Zhidong was unperturbed.
At the "2021 Teacher's Smart Bank" forum held in April this year, Zhang Chongmin's speech caused a sensation. He openly criticized Intel for its investment in the factory, saying that Intel had built a factory without any respect for the local people.
Zhang Chunguang's determination to invade the ETARC domain was due to his long-standing grudge against 30 years of accumulated electricity and ETARC.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always at the forefront of the US semiconductor industry, occupying the global pinnacle. It was the undisputed champion of the world's emerging microprocessor market.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end microprocessors were dominated by a few strong players.
During the half-conductor industry, IDM model was the feature of the chip, from design, manufacture to packaging, it was all completed by one factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this kind of pattern makes some small enterprises unable to bear the heavy burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only wish and watch the huge production line construction cost.
After feeling the market demand, the chip industry began to appear in the 80s, and the cooperation of subcontracting began to emerge. In 1984, Zhang Chung-Ming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in the production of chips.
After a short while, Zhang Chuang's dream became a reality; the Taipower generated electricity.
The company has been specializing in the production of glass circles for many years, without any design, only providing glass circle manufacturing services.
When the Taiwanese were just creating their own semiconductor industry, they were seen as a small and insign Home » News » News » 2018 » New Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalNew Public Artwork Unveiled at Antrim Area HospitalA new public artwork has been unveiled at Antrim Area Hospital.The artwork, which is located in the hospital’s main entrance, was created by local artist, David McFadden.The artwork is a sculpture made from steel and aluminium and is inspired by the hospital’s history and the surrounding landscape.The artwork was commissioned by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and was funded by the Department of Health.The artwork was unveiled by the Minister for Health, Simon Hamilton MLA, and the Chair of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, Jennifer Johnston.The Minister said: “I am delighted to be here today to unveil this wonderful new public artwork at Antrim Area Hospital. This sculpture is a beautiful and thoughtful addition to the hospital and I am sure it will be enjoyed by staff, patients and visitors for many years to
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chunguang had once found Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor was only in the chip manufacturing industry, it had some doubts and rejected the investment.
Zhang Chunguang also recognized that Intel was providing services for the assembly of the crystal at that time.
I never expected that when I was watching the documentary about the giant wheel manufacturing service last year, I would have to start doing it now.
Therefore, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when Intel entered the Jade Circle.
Now the value of Taiwan's chip industry has exceeded Intel.
Faced with the powerful challenge from Taiwan, Intel also dare not be passive and complacent.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor has already reached 3nm chip-making, while Intel is still lingering at 14nm from 7 years ago.
Wanting to escape the reality is not easy.
He didn't wait.

Today, let's take a look at some [weird] hot topics.
What is normal emotions?
After the three hot topics of the month of February: the Dragon Boat Festival, the Goods Price Increase, and the Crazy Rich Asians Event, the emotional wave spread and formed a peak, then followed by a smooth decline (a curved line). If the second wave of emotion is generated, it will have a small hump again.
It looks like the emotional model displayed on the official website of the network has a great difference with the one on the network.
What is the emotion of abnormality?
Six hot spots were randomly chosen from the same event, presenting a [Mountain Peak] shape, a [Fang Shape] shape, and a [Cliff Face] shape.
[Cyclical] Heat Wave, Rapidly Climbing the Temperature Chart, Attracting Public Attention; [Spiky] Periodic Heat, Ensuring the Topic Remains Hot; [Mountain] Collective Withdrawal, Performing the Function of Heat Wave, Receiving New Tasks and Challenges.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave is exactly the same as the valley of the other event, only a few seconds apart. It is inevitable that the united water army will be launched to the new attacking strategy.
The professionalization of the black gate is visible in the diversity of the hot search at the same time, which attracts the attention of the public, the responsibility of the commercial, the challenge of the strategic, the transfer of the visual axis, the influence of the cognition, the misleading judgment, the arousal of the emotion, and the fine-tuning of the tactics, the black account segmentation, the division of the nodes, and the refinement of the warfare, almost considering all the elements of the public opinion propaganda and diffusion.
Transmission is a science, opening up a new perspective, possessing various emotional factors, and even without any prior knowledge, it will be shaped by the black box.
Whatever path we take, we will leave behind a trace of our journey. Together, we can unearth these traces.
The source of the data is a hot search engine.
A case of plague was discovered in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China for the first time.

Because of trust, I began to introduce my friends. Therefore, I chose to take a look at the basic budget of 700,000 yuan for the initial stage of my house.
As soon as he entered the store, he began to perform a series of scams.
I was the first time to the store just showed them my floor plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they still gave me a price of $7 million, which is quite reasonable. They didn't even know what brand of material they were using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will drag you away and force you to hand over your money. (This money is gone forever unless you have enough experience and knowledge to fight them off.)
When I want to negotiate the price of the car, they will invite their manager to tell you. If you can negotiate the price of the car with us, you can get a discount.
This is an example of being cheated out of a lot of money. I was so angry that my head was spinning. In the end, I lost a million dollars.
He gave me an estimate with many problems, such as 7 million not including water and electricity renovation, excluding any doors and closets, and this is the cost of the foundation.
Their service fees are much higher than other companies' fees.
I lost trust in this company and didn't know what to expect at the beginning. So I just signed the contract without making things clear.
When I went to look for them to return the money, they displayed a very experienced mannerism, with a specialized team to face you.
Regardless of how it happened, the customer's problem was ultimately their own fault. They had no right to blame anyone else.
Responsibility for different types of refunds, as well as many details, do not want to speak all at once, it is all tears, do not choose them, because my friends found them to repair the house is also poor quality, later calculate different fees.
The original dragon costumes were made to fool people, but now they have all been shut down and changed to something else.
Therefore, everyone should choose the right company for the decoration of the house.
After everyone had chosen, they all looked up these answers and inquired about the cost of the renovation.

On December 12th, 2018, the renowned Chinese astronomer Professor Zhou Runcheng gave a special introduction to the audience at the New China News Agency in Tianjin. He shared his knowledge about the last and most grandiose meteor shower of the year, the Twin Zeta Ursid meteor shower, which will be arriving on the night of December 14th. Those who are fond of meteor showers can observe it after the night.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing captured a double zeta Ursa Minor rainbow on December 13th, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most of the periodic comets that bring us meteor showers are members of the Solar System's Oort cloud, but the mother of the meteor shower called the Lyrids is a 3200-numbered asteroid called 698 Aph2.
The second known meteor shower is the Zodiac Rain, which is not from the Zodiac Wheel but from a star.
The Chairman of the Tianjin Astronomical Society, Peng Xin, gave a lecture on the similarities between the Hengshan Paintings and the Zodiac Rainstorm, and the "Upcoming Meteor Showers" can be seen from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is renowned for its large flow rate and stable performance. It is often compared to the Chinese constellation of the same name, and is one of the three great meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
The most prominent feature of the Twin Star Cluster is its slow star speed, vivid colors, and abundance of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tens of thousands of amateur astronomers in Tianjin City, China, gathered on December 13, 2020 to photograph the double zeta Ursa Minorids meteor shower.
The meteor shower of the year 2019 will arrive on December 14th or 15th at around 15:00 UT. According to the prediction, the ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors per hour seen at the zenith) will be 150.
Recommend a star chart for the constellation of the Twins.
Last year, the twin stars of the Zodiac sign gave people a deep impression, but this year's twin stars will be affected by the interference of the moonlight, and the level of spectacularity will be reduced.
On the 14th day of the lunar month, the moon is at its full phase, shining brightly in the night sky. This can cause some interference for those trying to observe the moon, but it will become easier to observe later in the night when the moon is at its brightest. This is also the time when the double-star constellation of the Zodiac Rain can be seen, along with the radiation point of the star.
Enjoying the star shower and watching the rain after the full moon is a great experience. However, you should be aware of the cold and take measures to stay warm.
How can we observe more stars efficiently?
It is not advisable to conduct observations in the city, but one can choose to observe from a mountain, a rural area or a village facing east, and wait patiently until the moon falls before conducting the observation.
The radiation from the Double Star system is very strong in all directions. When observing, you don't need to keep staring at the Double Star system's radiation point.
Friends who love taking pictures should consider taking pictures of beautiful models in the rain with a wide angle lens and a slow shutter speed.

What differences exist between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional television that the host mentioned should be referring to liquid crystal television, while the difference between plasma and liquid crystal televisions in the market positioning mainly consists of two points:
The first one is to focus on the large-screen market.
Compared to the liquid crystal television market, the laser television market is more focused, as laser television is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream liquid crystal television size is between 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally above 75 inches, with the maximum size of over 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen colorful TV.
In recent years, the global demand and sales of laser TVs have been increasing significantly, accounting for over 60% of the total 80-inch and above TV market.
According to the prediction of the Chinese market, the growth of the laser TV market in 20
The reason why we have achieved such good results at the large market is due to the excellent performance of our laser TV in the protection eyewear department.
Based on the principle of laser television imaging, the light from the laser source is not directly reflected into the eye, compared to the liquid crystal television's backlight source, the imaging process is closer to the natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Shanghai Institute of Standardization and Quality Control, in collaboration with the Beijing Ophthalmology Hospital, conducted a strict comparison experiment of viewing laser and liquid crystal televisions under the same conditions, resulting in 144 sets of data.
Data Verification: Laser TVs have very strong eye protection features, even in certain aspects they can have certain improvement effects.
With the increasing awareness of eye health, laser eye surgery has become more and more popular. Not only does it take advantage of the eye health benefits, but it has also opened up a new market in the colorful world of cosmetic surgery.
The second generation of laser TVs will focus on the high-end market.
Exploring the price of liquid crystal televisions is an ongoing process, with prices currently ranging from thousands to millions of yuan, as the size and quality of the screens and light sources are improved.
What is the price of this expensive laser TV?
Ken is rational.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages which cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
By taking advantage of the short-focus lens and the advanced projection technique, the short-throw projector can achieve a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, with a small space requirement and a miniature host computer.
In the brightness aspect, a big brand laser TV can reach above 2000 lumens.
Adding a little bit of heat will reduce the power consumption of the device, which in turn will extend the lifetime of the TV and reduce the amount of wear and tear on the device.
Outside of this, there are many high-end laser TV models that have also loaded 4K Ultra High Definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and immersive sound experiences. This can provide users with a more exhilarating visual and audio experience.
Talking about the fake demand, instead of the general demand, is the product of fine division. Discussing the quality and investment of the product is the key to the balance between input and output. Fearing the lack of big screen and watching environment, you can try. Everything has its own advantage and disadvantage, and it is up to you to judge after weighing.
It's simple to say, but the wide angle lens is close to the screen, so it has to be used at a high price. The wide angle lens and the reflective mirror do not conform to the best optical design.
To block part of the environment light, using the fabric of Fengshui, the price is too expensive, 80 cm wide, the price is basicly changeable to 65 cm of liquid crystal.
There is still one point I want to emphasize. I am particularly dislike the way the projectionist put the movie screen. It is so uncomfortable for the eyes. Moreover, the light from the projector is directly shone to the screen, which is not good for the eyes. Even if you have a plasma TV, it is also shone with the same light, so it is not bright enough.
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will never be completed.
The hot spot effect of the curtain was ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from one corner. That was really difficult to bear.
The store is specialized in photography and video equipment. It is currently looking for quality products.
After adding a date to my WeChat appointment, my girlfriend quickly arranged the available time and replied the message promptly.
Before entering the store, I had a look at the photographs taken inside. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The shooting style involved various angles and perspectives.
After having simple conversations with my little sister, I tried two different outfits and finally settled on the one I wanted. The photographer asked me to move some accessories and posed me before taking the shots. He also guided me through the different actions and was very attentive to the details.
However, due to the lack of specific shooting ideas, the photos I took weren't what I wanted. But they should still be good-looking. 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, and there will be a good communication afterwards. It will be a stylish and meticulous selection of photos.
The effect of the makeover is about half a month, and it's worth the wait.
The second time the king of the photo shoot activity was held, almost all the clothes on the stage could be chosen for shooting.
After trying on several different items of clothing, she finally chose a black dress shirt, experien Home » News » News » 2018 » The 2018 Annual Report is now availableThe 2018 Annual Report is now availableThe 2018 Annual Report is now available. It provides an overview of the Council's activities and achievements over the past year.
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer is a 95-year-old brother, who feels slightly bored and has a bit of a green complexion. He hopes to give more advice in the future after the customer shooting action. The shooting process is quite enjoyable.
This store specializes in high-quality photography and video equipment. It is the best choice for photographers and videographers.
I have visited the homepage, so I have come to look at Queenie~
First, I filled in my name and phone number. Then I chose clothes, veil and makeup. The service was patient and the atmosphere was good. After that, I posed for a while and the photographer taught me how to pose. The result was amazing, it looked like I had double eyebrows! After a month, I received the photos. It was almost the same as the original one.
The environment is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
The makeup spot is not far away, there is a photography backdrop inside.
[Service] Very hot and very attentive.
The instructor was very patient.
The photographer will be very attentive in teaching you the action.
The photographer will also suggest retouching if you are not satisfied.
Experience has shown that the eyes may have become slightly crossed, the original double eyelid having been replaced by a triple one.
Even my eyebrows were shaved off, which made me feel a bit awkward for everyday without makeup.
The picture was taken after 10 minutes, but the P-picture effect was not satisfactory. It felt like there were two contact lenses stuck on the eyes.
Because it was not very clear what style to choose, she tried two sets. Eventually, she chose the black formal dress.
After choosing the clothes, the makeover process began. The stylist and the makeup artist were super patient and worked hard to get the desired result. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
After getting dressed and doing makeup, I started to take pictures. The photographer had complete control over my poses and movements throughout the process, which was very relaxed and choreographed.
After finishing the movie, my brother said he liked the four most. He said the ending was very satisfying.
I have not received any replies for 3 days due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, thus I cannot join #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee!
The most peculiar thing was that I always used the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay shipping fee every time.
Can I skip the payment first and then submit my salary for deduction later?
Should I buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small umbrella is a platform of insurance and financial services over the internet.
According to the regulations of the Insurance Regulatory Commission, to become a insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, founding person has no serious violation record in the past three years, minimum capital is 50000000 yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
This three-tiered system is actually quite complicated, summarizing it all comes down to having strength and endurance, needing to go through the state's regulatory department, having a good investment attitude, and being a small umbrella as a insurance company. Ultimately, whether or not the small umbrella insurance is legal is uncertain, but it is undeniable that it is a legitimate form of insurance.
At this point, it's not bad, it's worth believing in.
From insurance products, we can see that Small Umbrella Insurance is a kind of insurance marketplace, where many companies' star products are sold, such as the newly released and super-luxurious Mercedes-Benz 5th Wheelchair Insurance, with the guarantee of both the insurer and the insured. Small Umbrella Insurance is only a mediator, without any doubt of its trustworthiness.
From the perspective of cost structure: Internet platforms, due to the absence of operating costs of physical stores and the cost of human capital, have higher prices than traditional products, and the payment methods are flexible, reducing the burden of monthly payments, and alle Home » News » News » 2018 » The Future of Transportation is ElectricThe Future of Transportation is ElectricThe future of transportation is electric. With the emergence of electric vehicles, the world is now able to reduce emissions and create a more sustainable future. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular due to their low cost of ownership, low emissions, and improved performance.The City of Las Vegas is committed to promoting electric vehicles and has installed electric vehicle charging stations at various locations throughout the city. These charging stations are available for public use and are a great way to reduce emissions and promote sustainability.The City of Las Vegas is also offering incentives for those who purchase electric vehicles. Residents who purchase an electric vehicle are eligible for a $500 rebate. This rebate is intended to help offset the cost of the vehicle and encourage more people to make the switch to electric
This point is still very good.
You can consider it.
From the perspective of insurance professionals, this point is particularly important, as the insurance industry requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health and professional areas. Insurance professionals often add their own subjective views when self-insuring, which can easily lead to misrepresentation and even fraud.
I have done insurance sales over the phone for "Tencent Weibo" (just like Little Umbrella, it is an internet insurance platform). I am very responsible for telling you this.
Insurance for the Internet is real, but it's also risky. Unprofessional Internet channels lack experienced personnel, which can lead to misleading sales.
For example, if you buy insurance for 1 million yuan, you can get a free mobile phone and receive 6 million yuan of medical insurance. These marketing strategies have been successful, but they are not sustainable in the long run. First, the customer has to pay 1 yuan each month, and the fee increases by 200 yuan every two months. Many customers are confused about why they have to pay for something they have already bought.
I can spend 1 block of gold to buy insurance, and the insurance company will pay me 600 million (the whole world is bankrupt).
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666, 8888, etc. which are only sent out with lucky draws. Furthermore, if you win the lucky draw, you will not receive the prize money and there is no one to remind you.
For those who are investing in insurance, it's just another hole in the ground. If you only rely on this, without any other business risks, what if the real disaster happens? 6 million can't solve the problem, and it won't solve the problem in the future. Life will be full of running and hiding.
At present, the country is also vigorously combating the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, we should look at the platform, product and business from all angles, and the problem lies in the professionalism and work ethic of the staff.
Recommendations for choosing an insurance agent should be considered carefully, as there are many insurance companies offering a wide range of products and opportunities for customers to choose from, as well as competitive prices for some products.
I have helped 59 online customers, guaranteeing the product and saving up to 2000-3000 RMB per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an experienced insurance broker with over 3 years of business management training and a track record of serving over 1000 companies. I always start from customer needs when designing insurance products, strive to offer competitive prices from 3 insurance companies during the bidding process, and do my best to get the best result for customers after the bidding. I also take care of all the paperwork after the bidding and manage the insurance policy for customers.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answers can be helpful to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, online insurance is when a person clicks on the insurance link and can complete the entire insurance process autonomously.
During this process, neither the insured nor the insurance agent needs to sign any documents, and all steps can be completed by the insured himself.
Although there is no "ceremony feeling" in online insurance, even the paper contracts of printing out the insurance policy may not exist, but it will not affect the validity and legality of the electronic contracts.
This kind of pattern is similar to the traditional telephone sales job, but when it comes to buying insurance, it will have a life-threatening problem, that is, - the subsequent service may not match up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contractual agreement that lasts for many years. When we purchase insurance, should we carefully consider and reflect upon it?

There is no problem, remember to make no unnecessary arrangements, I have already bought, do not want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of discrimination and ridicule, and cannot accept any form of physical or verbal attack.
In the civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't see the political party and factionalism, you must first suppress it, which is an uncivilized wind.
From you I started to send friend requests, then I posted a flirty thread on your wall, and finally I tried to publish your home address and father's name on social media. I have already taken an unresponsive attitude.
After you tagged me, you continued to talk about me behind my back in a malicious and insidious manner. You discussed my private matters, such as my shyness, embarrassment, and physical appearance. You even talked about my sleeping and eating habits. All of this made me feel so uncomfortable and humiliated.
After I sent you the picture, I received many messages from your friends, including some related to your face, some related to your behavior, and some related to your embarrassing moments.
I'm sorry, as a female student, I can't keep silent anymore.
After you upload the news about me reporting a crime, you have not been trapped at all, instead you have become more and more aroused.
Regardless of your political background or identity, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
You can continue this type of argumentative, provocative, humiliating, and berating language, or you can continue to say that you are only loving and concerned with me, or you can continue to deny that it is harassment, or you can even continue to post all kinds of attacking speech.
You can't stop them.
Even if I don't recognize you, I don't want to recognize you. My appearance and physique do not need your evaluation and comments.
I was so ashamed that I felt like no one would want to be friends with me after what I had done.
My friend asked me, is it still good?
I said hello, you wouldn't believe it.
I think no one can be so humiliated afterward that they can't still say they're okay.
Regardless of work, society, politics, or business, only those people who lack basic human decency will choose to harm any woman in such a manner.
I believe, the path of righteousness is within everyone's heart.
I have cut some of the comments and gave them to everyone for review.
You should not let anyone bully you.
You are the enemy of civilization.

The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China and can be seen in the latest satellite images. The most powerful weapon in the U.S. arsenal is visible and can be accessed from the island of Taiwan. This is a significant signal to the region's allies and adversaries.
According to the South China Sea Strategy and Situation Awareness Platform, on January 9th, the US Navy's "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier was found in the Balabac Strait.
The Sunda Strait, which connects the Java Sea and the South China Sea, is a strategic location in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
This platform has predicted that the "Carl·Wen·Sen" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the Carl-Gustaf Widmark aircraft carrier for the first time loaded with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 "Sea Dragon" transport aircraft deployment.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is currently sailing in the South China Sea, apart from the "Carl Vinson" itself, there is also the "USS Abraham Lincoln" which was launched on January 3rd from the United States.
The F-35C Lightning II, the U.S. Navy's newest carrier-based fighter jet, has made its debut in the South China Sea. The 314th Fighter Squadron of the U.S. Navy's Land-Based Aviation is responsible for the attack.
Besides the two aircraft carriers and the submarine mentioned above, the U.S. Navy has another carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, stationed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The mothership battle group still includes the "Shanghai Lake" and "Strike Destroyer" class vessels, as well as the "Avenger" class vessels designed for long-range ocean patrols.
The United States has deployed three aircraft carriers to the South China Sea, according to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Observation Platform" published on January 17, 2022. The satellite image shows the three aircraft carriers gathering in the vicinity of China.
(@SouthChinaSea Strategic Situation Awareness) The US Navy has deployed its most powerful weapon to the South China Sea for a rare visit. The CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft flew along the route on 17th January 2022.
According to the US cable television news network (CNN) on January 17th, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy weapons store was mysteriously missing from the weekend. It was reported that the weapon was seen in the vicinity of Guangdong.
The nuclear-powered submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-733) entered the waters of Guam on Saturday, January 15th. It was accompanied by a Trident missile-armed submarine and several other vessels.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have been gathering in the South China Sea, making it the most powerful weapon ever seen in the region. Analysts say this is a signal of the tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US submarine has visited the Diaoyu Islands since 2016, and it is the second time the islands have been openly visited since the 1980s.
The Chinese navy has been expanding its presence in the South China Sea by building military installations on several disputed islands. Recently, Chinese vessels have been seen around the Spratly Islands, which are located near the Philippines.
The island is a popular tourist destination in China.
The U.S. Navy declared in its statement that the "Inner China Delta" class of nuclear-powered submarine had been strengthened during its visit to the South China Sea, demonstrating the U.S. capability, flexibility, and readiness, as well as its commitment to the region's security and stability.
The typical submarine used for boomer operations is called a "Boomer submarine" (or "Boomer").

The secret of the submarine-launched ballistic missile, "Leapfrog" became the most important survival weapon in the world. This system also includes a domestic launch facility in the United States and B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear missiles.
Following the recent plunge of Meta, its market value has been evaporated by 2510 million US dollars. What is the reason behind this unprecedented competition?
Metta (Original Facebook) is a advertising company, mainly earning from advertisements, today's advertising company, with its own traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., regardless of what kind of function it is, it is all a flow channel of Meta.
Not only this, but Meta is also the largest “Advertising Alliance”, with many Apps connecting to it through its advertising platform, thus enabling the appearance of changes.
However, the times have changed.
Because of the privacy policy adjustment of Apple, it is difficult to get user data information again, which affects the efficiency of advertisement spending.
Apple's privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will be very obvious to users whether they allow the app to get their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google further sharpens its sword and cuts into the Meta's income, the impact will be even greater.
The second factor weakening the Chinese element in the previous Meta's income growth is the uncertainty of its weight (which is not definite).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of the company's income comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies' contributions to the maritime industry.
There are about 100 people in the office in Hong Kong, and there are several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas market, and Meta is the only reliable advertising channel for them. Spending a lot of money on it.
One of the major competitors of TT is Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from the Chinese market.
Agents from all over China have been helping each other to promote their businesses on the Chinese social media platform, WeChat. The performance of the Chinese region on WeChat is very good.
I haven't been specializing in it recently, but I'm sure it will be better than before.
The stage of China's large-scale overseas money-making has already passed.
The third, the new flow channel expansion is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, with new platforms such as TT included in it. They are not in the Meta hand anymore.
The biggest problem is not only a decrease in income, but also a lack of growth expectation.
Not only do we need to look at current income in the capital market, but it is also important to look at our expectations for the future.
It became obvious very soon that the expectations for Meta were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zack Brown talked about “The Universe”.
The universe is the direction of the future, but its implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the value of Meta in three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be more difficult than ever for Meta.
Don't look at the face of the book now, it is very bright, every year there are 1000 million to 2000 million US dollars of income, the real sense of the book now is very strong, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is nothing good security of the river.
Although his social media presence is currently higher than ever, it is still a popular social media platform, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but faced with the rapid development of TikTok, it has no confidence, and it is a stealthy tactics.
Translating this Chinese text into English, I found that it is about the concept of space and time. It talks about how short time frames are impossible to succeed in, and how dangerous it is to change companies. It also mentions why Keckeburck chose his path, and why he is always searching for new challenges. I think his path is wrong, as it is a wrong turn.

The Chinese and Vietnamese armies concluded their joint peacekeeping and rescue exercise “Peaceful Rescue 2021” on the New Year’s Eve. The exercise was held in the border area of China and Vietnam from December 22 to 31. The two armies conducted various types of rescue and peacekeeping operations, including medical aid, search and rescue, and evacuation. The exercise was a success and concluded with a grand closing ceremony.
On December 12th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Vietnam People's Army jointly held the "Peacekeeping Rescue - 2021" exercise in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a delegation to participate in the exercise. All the members of the delegation safely returned to China. This marks the successful completion of the 7-day exercise.
This joint performance was to explore the great topic of humanism in medical rescue and relief. We had to be vigilant and tenacious in our work, and to make sure that every casualty was treated with the utmost care and respect. We had to adhere to the standards of real-life battlefield medical treatment and evacuation, and complete the tasks of joint command and joint rescue, joint field medical treatment, and mass casualty evacuation. This effectively improved the two armies' medical rescue and security capabilities.
After practicing hard, I was able to get the approval of the two armies.
The Vice Chairman of the Exercise Instruction and Supervision Committee of the People's Army of Vietnam, Long Van Xuan, spoke at the conclusion of the exercise, saying that through this exercise, the Vietnamese military doctors have learned the knowledge of exercise organization and professional activities from the Chinese side. They also saw the medical and safety equipment of China.
