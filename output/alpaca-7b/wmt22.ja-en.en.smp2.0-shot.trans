I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the miko become a mystery? She was so popular on TV.
Yesterday, I watched Chirori with my staff members. Although it was not very interesting, my staff members started laughing out loud at some parts of the movie. It was quite amusing.
It's not funny when you're just making a fool of yourself.
Even though the staff didn't laugh, it was still difficult to work with them because they were so unpleasant.

I was so surprised when I received the wrong item I had ordered from the online store.
The instruction was: "Order the wireless mouse and it will be replaced with a wired version for free if you want to return it."
The topic of self-made PCs has become quite popular recently, but it seems to cause some trouble. However, it's still worth considering as there are many renowned stores offering great deals.
We discovered that a wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (including tax) at a tsukumo net shop (a shop specializing in tsukumo, a type of net used for fishing) from the day before the sale started.
Since the same price was found at the storefront, the possibility of price misconduct was considered and the page of the wireless version was confirmed to be 5,071 yen (Link to Uniqlo). Therefore, there was no misconduct.
The order mail arrived normally, and the next day shipment mail also arrived normally.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" can be found in both my email and purchase history on my page.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notice from the order to delivery, I thought the wirelessly mauled mouse would come at that time.
The problem was from the shipping from, after few hours of waiting, I received an email saying "There was an error in product registration".
That's what the mail said.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually the wired version that was being sold.
Since we are already sending wireless mice,
We refused to accept the cancellation.
You can return a mouse for an exchange or a refund.
Use a wireless mouse without any modification.
Choose an appropriate response.
It appears that the product page of both the wireless and wired version of the product has been merged, so that the purchase history, mail and even the wireless version has been changed without notice.
You purchased the item and sent it to someone else without understanding the item. Will you have to pay for it?

The only bridge out of the area due to the typhoon and heavy rain was washed away by the flood. The residents had to stock up food supplies three times as much. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsumoto from Shimokawa-machi, Kuma-gun, Fukushima-ken.
The great impact of the 8-person staycation in 2019 was the East Japan Typhoon.
Mr. Matsumoto was feeling a bit nostalgic. He said, "It all started with a feeling of'majika'."
It was a very lonely feeling when the only road connecting the town with the mountain, the Tohoku-Oki Bridge, was swept away by the Tohoku-Oki tsunami. 30 people from the 11th generation of the local family were left stranded in the disaster zone.
The strong-willed residents who had broken through the water barrier were forced to carry necessary supplies over the JR's steel bridge every day.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "If you go to the station, the train will come soon. If you take the bus, you can get there faster. But if you walk, you can enjoy the scenery along the way. It's better to take your time and enjoy the walk. That's why the traffic and the difficulty of the car is not necessary." A month later, the emergency bridge was washed away by a flood. People had to wait for three months until the temporary bridge was built. During this period, they were again in a state of isolation.
After two years of rebuilding from the disaster, Matsumoto-san has been continuing his efforts to educate people about disaster prevention.
Mr. Matsumoto is thinking about buying a 10-case lot of sake.
We should ensure that people have enough to eat for at least two to three days. This could include canned goods, instant noodles, and other non-perishable food items, which could be stocked up on before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "I don't know when a disaster will strike me, so I'm trying to build up a little bit of a reserve and hope for the best." Meanwhile, Yamanashi-machi, which experienced an "unforeseen disaster" with the bridge being washed away.
To never forget the lessons learned in 2021, the town began to develop its own unique take on the matter.
The town of Kagami is going to hold an event called "Disaster Prevention Day" on October 12th in the future. We would like to think about what kind of preparations we can make for disaster prevention on that day.
Even though we have already experienced many unexpected events, our awareness of the possibility of such events has greatly increased.

Experience the Paralympic Games in Virtual Reality (Tokyo MX News)

Participants were amazed by the beautiful scenery which changed so suddenly.

When buying a used house, be careful!
The Hole and the Fissure Caused by the Earthquake Intensity Survey System (Diamond Online - Yahoo! News)
Towards the revitalization of the used housing market, a new system for inspecting building conditions has been set up. Used housing transactions have been going smoothly.
The price of construction and the cost of a mansion have been increasing, and the reform market is also expected to expand in the trend.
As the number of earthquakes increases, the demand for inexpensive new construction has grown rapidly, leading to a boom in construction of "tower" type buildings, which are represented by words such as "large-scale", "tower" and "station".
Although existing (old) housing is still abundant in Japan, the existing (old) housing share in Japan is still low compared to overseas.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started the Building Condition Survey, which is aimed at ensuring safe and secure used houses, in 2018 (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a builder who is skilled in residential construction checks the current condition and the condition of the building by checking the status of the property and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining that there is a benefit for both buyers and sellers with the introduction of inspections.
By conducting an inspection of the goods before the transaction, the merchant can avoid the cost of cleaning afterward, and provide the buyer with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination against women has been increasing in the workplace.
Even if you are on the buying side, you can grasp the condition of the used house you are going to buy, and it is a system that you can buy it easily and get a great benefit.
On the system of the current building inspection, the principal responsibility for guidance lies with the seller.
In addition, we should pay attention to the fact that the announcement of the inspection system has become obligatory at the workplace.
Real estate agents who handle property transactions are expected to introduce a construction engineer to inspect the building conditions when needed, but the actual implementation is not obligated.
Although there is a risk of being nervous during the inspection of the salesperson in Japan, overseas it is possible to find a vibrant used car market in America and other countries where similar systems have been set up already.
Before engaging in the process of buying or selling a house, the buyer typically hires an inspector or building surveyor to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the case of America, approximately 70 to 90 percent of the inspe The National Park Service is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. To mark the occasion, the NPS is hosting a series of events and activities throughout 2016. The theme of the centennial is “Find Your Park” and encourages people to explore and enjoy the national parks.The NPS website has a list of centennial events and activities. There are also a variety of resources available to help plan a trip to a national park. The website also has a page with information about volunteer opportunities and a page with educational resources.The NPS also has a page with information about the history of the NPS, as well as a page with information about the NPS mission and goals.The NPS is a great way to explore the natural beauty of the United States and learn more about our history. To find out more about the NPS and its centennial celebration, visit the NPS website.
In terms of the point that "the buyer" is leading the inspection, the main difference between Japanese-style inspection and its nature is great.
The owner of the building can often be seen inspecting the condition of the building, even if only slightly, in order to raise its value and sell it quickly.
We are considering moving to a place where we can feel safe and secure.
Even if we have the same goal and thought, it is difficult to avoid misunderstanding.
For this reason, risks such as anxiety have been pointed out regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of inspection of the salesperson-customer relationship model determined by the country shall not be minimized.
Because detailed survey is not possible, there is a risk of overlooking important defects. ● For inspection companies, introducing customer cases and being able to communicate with customers is essential.
There is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted if the company fails to report unfavorable survey results to the customer or engages in other "trickery".

Is the Silver Zone an island?
5 Popular Subjects in the Study of Languages (LEON.JP News) - Yahoo! News
This place used to be the ancient capital of Japan.
That's why it's a bit difficult to find a place to expose your own little bit of scholarship in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to the knowledge of the Silver Square Bean in Tokyo. It's quite interesting and you might want to talk about it with someone.
Go up to the Silver Zone!?
He entered the room for the first time.
As you walk through the Ginza district, you can see the changing of the winds, mysterious stone monuments, numerous old shops and the shadow of history carved in the streets.
As she walked to the Silver Zone, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a profound silence. She realized it was the same tranquil atmosphere of the ancient past.
Was the Silver Zone the Hakatsume Peninsula?
The nickname "Ginza" for the bustling shopping district in Tokyo has become a popular shorthand for luxury and glamour.
The Ginza, which is now a popular shopping and entertainment district in Tokyo, was originally a silver smithing shop located in Edo (present-day Tokyo) in 1612.
At that time, it was referred to as "New Substitute Town" but eventually became known as "Ginza" due to its transfer to that location.
According to the news, a "semi-island" emerged from the sea near the Ginza district.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed from the east and the area within the circle was filled with water. This area was known as "Edojima" and extended from the Sumida River to the Ginza.
The cutting edge of that island is currently located in the Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened a bakufu in Edo and buried the moat, thus beginning the construction of the Kyobashi district.
We have been repairing and developing the port infrastructure in order to promote water transportation. We have also been leveling the riverbanks to facilitate the development of the local economy.
Thus, they dug up the earth at the burial mound and the Shimoda Mountain and filled in the river.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument showing the site of the Ginza Subway Station. Therefore, if you are interested in Ginza's history, it is worthwhile to take a look.
People know the Silver Zao as the "Holy Ground Pilgrimage".
Silver Zao is the place of "Silver Zao Hachiman Shrine MEGURI" which is known by people and is the site of an annual Shinto ritual.
In the backstreets of the sacred sites of over 10 shrines, the most alluring is the "Kabuki-za" in front of which stands.
On the right side of the stage where the geisha stands, there are fewer and fewer people who visit the theatre before and after the performance.
One side, the "Lion King" statue is on the roof of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, the "Silver Pavilion" statue is on the 9th floor of the Sensoji Temple.
The Shrines of Inari, located in various places, are often seen as the guardian deities of rice and sake. The most famous of these is the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, which is dedicated to the god Inari and is known for its thousands of bright orange torii gates. Other notable shrines include the Tori-no-Ichi Shrine in Tokyo, the Adashino Inari Shrine in Nara, and the Suwa Taisha Shrine in Suwa, which is dedicated to the god Susanoo.
This shrine is where people worship the immortal kings and guardian spirits as well as the gods of the land and sea. However, most shrines only worship the gods of the harvest as gods of the rice and other crops.
In front of the Shaden (a type of shrine) foxes would greet people and bring them good luck. Since there were many farmers in the area, the 5 Grains Shrine (Inari) was built there to take advantage of its good luck.
As it has been transformed into a bustling metropolis like Kyoto and Edo, there is a great benefit in shopping in such places, and it has become a city of glamour and faith, like Tokyo's Ginza.

Is there a possibility of catching such a disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of the pain in the knee joint can be various, such as patellar tendinitis, joint inflammation, and overuse injuries.
In Japan, it is very common for people to suffer from "Spondylitis".
Is the editing team worried about the changes in the joints?
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
Our original purpose is to cover the surface of the joints with soft tissue in order to absorb the impact and to make the movements of the joints smoothly.
Taking part in activities such as aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause the soft tissues to become stiff and restricted, resulting in limited mobility.
As a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
Does knee joint pain often occur in addition to foot pain?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Even outside the knee, there are joints and attachments of the fingers, toes, head, chest, abd The 2018-2019 school year is off to an exciting start! We are thrilled to welcome our new students and families to the community and look forward to another great year. We are also excited to announce the launch of our new website, which is designed to provide a more user-friendly experience for our current and prospective families.The website has been designed to provide easy access to information about our school, including our curriculum, programs, and events. It also provides a platform to share our school’s story and showcase the amazing work of our students, teachers, and staff.We hope you enjoy exploring the new website and find it a useful resource. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to let us know.
Unfortunately, the most common case is a knee case of "Transformation Knee Joint Disease".
Editing Team: What kind of structure has the joint become?
Mr. Maruyama: The two bones of the joint are connected with each other by ligaments, which are stretched and contracted according to the range of motion.
Then, the two-sided portion that is covered with "Joint Flexible Cartilage" is surrounded by "Joint capsule" which is covered with "Synovial Membrane".
The editing team: It's complicated structure makes it difficult.
Mr. Maruyama: That's great.
There is a layer of slippery tissue called synovial membrane inside the joint capsule, which creates the joint fluid.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronate and condrocyte sulfate.
It is said that "moving the knee joints smoothly requires good sources of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate".
What kind of symptoms do you get when you transform into a shape-shifter?
Mr. Maruyama: Connective tissue is elastic and has a lot of viscoelasticity, so it can absorb shock and prevent direct contact between bones.
Iwaba is a role like that of a maid in a café.
Unfortunately, if you continue to strain yourself, it can cause joint deformities, inflammation, and pain.

Experience the thrill of the "Kaiji" series with a real-life gambling and game show 3-pack (with real sound)!
Gyaru manga series "Kaji" centering on male characters that explode with popularity.
There is a game with an extreme sense of purpose hidden in the depths of one of the flavors of this work.
[Picture] Just watching...... Sukumu Bridge Iron Bone Challenge!
Let's test the game of the Kaji who is actually playing the game this time, or making a plan video.
The trap-filled Pachinko Parlour "Nu" appeared in the movie "Pachinko Breaking Bad".
At the original work, it was sold at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball, shocking the spectators.
This "pond" was filled with a huge trap of the "Mine" series, "Mobility Tool" and "3-tiered Culvert" which made it almost impossible to infiltrate.
After using various tools such as a saw, a hammer, and a chisel, he lowered the stone foundation and tilted it towards the building. He then filled the foundation with wine and set it on fire.
The character "Kai" from the anime "Kai-Ni-Pachi" has become popular, and many people are playing it as a Pachinko game.
Even though things like "1000-yen shop" and "4000-yen shop" have become less common, it is still possible to find bargains.
The "Star Side Party" held a cash prize for the inclusion of a kaji in the event. This was a test of human horse racing, which is the steel bone crossing.
The debtors are struggling to keep their balance on the narrow steel bones installed on the ground 10 meters above, while they are contriving various techniques to move faster.
12 people can participate and the top 2 people can win the prize money, but the steel bones are only 4, which makes the safety measures inadequate and the death possibility quite high.
This bridge is very dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game and as a fan experience at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi". It is possible to have a very close experience by visiting the "Eagles Bridge".
This bridge is 20 meters high (7 floors) and is located at a steel-framed bridge which is called "Sky Bridge" and "Victory Bridge" at the end. People walk towards it.
We are taking all necessary safety measures.
Corey Taylor of the band Slipknot went to Japan and experienced the "Bungee Jumping" in his YouTube video, which became a hit.

This game is very popular and the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
Kayako is struggling with a harsh rule of "If you lose, you have to cut your own ears off" as she and Rika fight against the River.
A device that could sense changes in blood pressure and body temperature by shattering eardrums like the one in the Iya Valley was said to be filled with excitement. It was said to have caused chaos in the River Iya by severely disrupting the normal values.
The card is available in stores, such as Amazon, where it can be purchased.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, appeared in a movie as a karate master and challenged his opponent to a duel with E-Cards. This video has been widely shared.

Take a step towards the new year, and generously give it a push at the Kagura Shrine in Yamagata.
Preparations for the New Year are progressing at the Kagura Shrine in Yamagata City, where a giant picture of the deity of the New Year, "Torri" (the deity of the New Year's water) appeared.
On November 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students went to the shrine and gave a prayer at the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting apprenticeship of the original paintings of the ema from the last year.
Nine students from the Japanese Painting Course taught by Prof. Kazuo Shiraga and Sadamasa Motai at the University of Tokyo Department of Fine Arts have had their works selected for employment. 22-year-old Yui Sasaki (柚衣) is one of them.
The giant picture horse is 3.3 meters wide and has a height of about 1.8 meters at its center.
Mr. Tsuchiya drew an image of a person pushing their way through the cherry blossom petals to step into a new year.

"I want to continue living in Tama-no. I propose a workshop for high school students in the city."
What kind of town was 2030's Yamanouchi?
The student representatives of four high schools in Tama City are discussing the idea of staying together in Tama as part of a workshop.
We are conducting a survey and policy proposal for the "Tamano S.D.G.S. Mirayuku Center" which is a business that provides employment for young people. We are gathering the voices of young people to present to the mayor.
What is funny in such a situation?

The first event was held at the Sunshine Ace Cafe on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed the theme that was decided upon while they were moving to the "island" that was chosen by each of them. The method of "World Cafe" was used to consider the following topics: "An interesting town", "A livable town", and "A town to feel the atmosphere of life".
Each person's thoughts were written on a slip of paper and organized by modelling clay.
A town with many young people is interesting. There are many ways to travel such as taking a train or a bus which do not require a reservation.

The New Way to Find Stores (Yahoo! News)
You must not miss out on any stores during the winter, but there is nothing you can do about the fact that your head is cold.
While adjusting the balance by looking into the mirror, I heard a voice saying that it was difficult to understand.
When I thought there might be a store nearby, I looked around carefully and found a new thing.
The store for the brand "Cotori" is said to be around 1 meter long, making it more compact than average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I make something this short and curly?"
When you look at it closely, you can see it is made of fine, evenly cut strips of cloth, like a net.
The ends of the net are stretched so that it is possible to pass through them.
Even if you don't join the ends, you can still wrap it up by tying a knot.
The fabric is very light and warm.
This year, the popular trend of wearing a shirt without a sleeve (Best) has become widespread. However, people are combining it with a jacket or coat to keep their shoulders warm.
When you have a store like this, it's really convenient.

There are so many different kinds of butterflies. Every time I see them, I feel amazed. They are so beautiful and colorful.
Even though we were about to be scattered, we still laughed and enjoyed ourselves. It was a dramatic and funny moment.
While working hard, I suddenly realized that I was able to understand Paul and George's conversations! I was so surprised! Then, I started to talk slowly and carefully, and I felt like time was standing still. I was so excited that I couldn't help but laugh.
It's so tiring to hear that kind of bickering all the time. But then I realized that the air was so full of that kind of energy that even the Beatles must have felt it. That's why it's so legendary.
Everyone will start to play music in that kind of atmosphere.

Even though it was only three chapters into the story, the most influential factor behind the disbandment of the Beatles was the environment surrounding them.
Four people began to sing a song together. They were so excited that they started to dance. Where should they perform their live? Talking about it, a producer and some promoters said, "Let's take the Beatles around the world!" Everyone agreed and started to plan.
Ever since the documentary film about the making of the movie "The Dark Knight" came out, people have been talking about how Peter Jackson was so impressed by it that he felt compelled to re-shoot some of the scenes in his own movie. Even though it's been talked about a lot, it's still a mystery as to whether or not it actually happened.
Because Paul is watching the movie, there are a lot of scenes with Paul as the protagonist and the antagonist.

I had to change my job because I was getting too sick from the work I was doing. I had to find something else to do, so I decided to switch to a different type of job. I thought that doing something different would be beneficial for me. It was a great decision and I'm really enjoying it.
I was able to find some things that I could be proud of even though I couldn't do much. I hope to be able to discover things that I can be proud of in the future and make my life more enjoyable.

Even if life is a bit dull in the future, it will still be nice to have pleasant feelings.

In America, there have been numerous reports of large-scale wildfires, causing severe weather conditions and cold weather.
A powerful typhoon, named Trami, has been rapidly intensifying since it made landfall in Japan on October 10th (Friday) night and is expected to move towards the America South.
As a result of strong cold air from the south below, the air condition became very unstable. Moreover, the turbulent clouds developed rapidly.
A warm and muggy air mass from the Southwest has been pouring into the Southern United States, resulting in record-breaking heat.
In Texas, the highest temperature in Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Monday (9th) and Tuesday (10th).
In a place where it was record-breakingly warm, a strong cold front from the skies of 5500m below (-30°C) suddenly descended, resulting in a powerful frontal system and turbulent clouds advancing rapidly.
It was observed that the dragon eggs were hatching one after another in the outskirts.
The southern region of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage decreases significantly from the start of summer to the hurricane season.
The warning issued in one day of winter season has reached more than 150 locations nearby. It was recorded in great amount.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States has reported 400+ reports of tornadoes and strong winds in just 10 days (Friday) alone.
According to this, there are two distinct areas in the United States that are heavily concentrated along the southern and northern lines that extend from Texas to California and include the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and California respectively.
In the EF Scale in KenTakki City, the strength of the dragon's roar was shown by the improved Fujita Scale, reaching the third strongest EF3 before the gust of 70m/s was heard.
By surveying the situation afterward, it is possible to determine whether an EF4 or EF5 tornado occurred.
JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used to assess the situation of Japanese buildings such as their damage and destruction caused by natural disasters.
The level of JEF3 infection in the United States is high enough to cause serious damage, such as the destruction of wooden houses.

With regard to the typhoon damage in the western and southern parts of the United States, the president of the United States, Barack Obama, on November 11 (Japanese time: November 12) showed a remarkable face reading and divination of the "one and only dragon's whirlwind in US history".
CNN and other American television networks reported it.
Biden emphasized that he would do "anything" as a unified government.
We still don't know the extent of the damage caused by the loss of life.
The fear of death has surpassed 100 people.
In Kenitra, Morocco, residents have been removing damaged furniture and belongings from houses affected by the Kenza cyclone for the past 10 nights and continue to do so until 11am on November 15th. The Kenza cyclone has caused more than 30 deaths in at least 6 states.
The record of the 1925 Mizoram tornado, which caused damage up to 219 miles (350 kilometers) long, is still left, but American CNN meteorologist estimated it to be around 250 miles (400 kilometers) long this time.
In Meaford, Ontario, Canada, the Christmas shopping season lasted 24 hours and caused a great deal of damage to the local factory.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and the traces were erased.
A woman who was unable to move due to the thickness of the darkness beneath the 1.5-meter-high garbage pile felt the weight of the rescue worker as she searched for the garbage pile on her smartphone and Facebook Live broadcast.
In addition to the female announcer's pleas for help, the sound of weeping and another female voice singing in a tremolo were heard in the live broadcast of "Happy Birthday to You", which was being sung in a somber manner.
An employee of a convenience store in Meifield, named Bruce, was able to hide his 5-year-old son and himself in the basement of his house without any harm after the warning siren sounded.
There were many people who were listening to the sound of the train, but it was a fearsome sound like a distant thunder.
The police officer of Meifield City said, "We will continue the search activity until it is no longer necessary."
We don't know how long it will take, how many months it will be, or how many years it will take to recover. But we will continue to do our best in our helpless rescue efforts.
In Irino, Ibaraki Prefecture, a warehouse storing large amounts of internet and mail order purchases, such as amphetamines, has collapsed, resulting in at least 6 deaths.
The impact of the train car being separated is so strong that even the fences and barriers have been sealed off due to the accidents such as derailment of the train and the car turning over on the highway.
It is reported that over 40 million people in the U.S. are without power due to the web media reports from Texas.

It is an old saying that different approaches are taken towards the evaluation system of the star chart.
Other countries are challenging Japan to reduce their points by 5 stars, while Japan is arguing to increase their points by 3 stars.
There is a difference between two stars in the standard point of time, but four stars are "not a factor element" and "beautiful work".
If the work is judged based on five stars, then the work that is of the highest standard will be crowned as the "best work" and the work that is of the lowest standard will be crowned as the "worst work" since there is a tendency for this to happen. Therefore, I think it is better to avoid using stars on systems since it may lead to such a situation. It is better to avoid using three stars (negative evaluation) since it may lead to such a situation.
If people continue to argue about the Steam 2 review system, the conversation will become meaningless.

The Radio Show.

The sound of the radio was heard, but it was tuned to a different frequency.
It was not possible to hear the sound of the sewing machine from the other room, even though there was a possibility that it might have been noisy.

One man was killed and another injured after being run over by a man bike in Saga City, Japan on the 12th. This is an ongoing murder case.
At 1:25 am on June 12th in Saga City, Fukuoka Prefecture, an 40-year-old man was stabbed with a knife by a man in his 30s to 40s. He was also beaten and robbed of his wallet.
The man fled on a bike and the Saga Police are following his trail as a suspected murder case.
According to the police, there was a person who was "kicking" at the station. There was also an 110 call.
Men are about 10 centimeters tall and 1 centimeter deep, but they have an awareness.
The man who fled was wearing a thick skinhead.
It was discovered that a knife used in the crime was left behind at the scene.
It is reported that a man and a woman were drinking alcohol and walking together, and a traffic accident involving a bicycle man and a car man occurred.

A family's long journey to protect the environment in China's border region was recently featured in the JBpress news website.
(Katou Yasuyuki: Hong Kong Companies Find Asia Consultant) China, which is vast in terms of land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with over 1000 species of mammals, and 3000 species of plants.
We recognize the value of biological diversity as proclaimed by the Self-Governing Body, and not only do the Self-Governing Body carry out environmental protection, but also actively promote environmental activities by the local people.
The province of Xishuangbanna (Western-sounding name: "Xiangshuangbanna") in China's southwestern region is one of the many regions in the area.
Sister Li Wan is a renowned actress in Myanmar and Laos, and is a region that shares the Tai (Tai) and Lu (Lao) tribes with the Kingdom of Thailand. It is the starting point of the "Tai (Tai)" ethnic group, and many minority ethnic groups live here.
The source of the Mekong River is flowing through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Saisiyat people (Southern Siamese) form an ethnic group in Taiwan. Their total land area is only about 0.2% of the total land area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the wild animal species and 20% of the plant species in China.
I visited Lixin Guo, a Chinese environmentalist who is currently in Japan for an environmental protection activity. We had a talk about the activity and its contents.
A German man and his wife started an environmental protection activity together. They started the activity 20 years ago.
What was that noise?
Mr. Li has been leading our environmental protection activity "Tenchu" since 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and was involved in a joint science project with the United Nations and China. He went to Saipan to work on it.
This area is the only tropical rainy forest in China, and it is abundant with diverse wildlife.
Nevertheless, that one side has been slowing down the economic growth.
Therefore, to establish industry in this region, we had to import large amounts of rubber from China, where there was a shortage due to the previous hot and rainy season.
The husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
Then, after getting to know the journalist, I got married.
Was Mr. Li interested in nature conservation before?
My grandfather is from Shishapangma, but I have no interest in the significance and biodiversity of the mountain.
We have become accustomed to advancing our project without knowing much about it.
Even though there is no special back, people who are tall are admired. Why is that?
A popular actor said something.
Oral is not an item that can be bought.
In that moment of self-confidence, a miracle of nature was revealed.
That person is sure to have a strong sense of self-confidence, even though they may appear to be shy on the surface.

Did you wash your face this morning?
What would happen if the secret was revealed to the sakura san?

[Personal Memory Loss] CTD was the cause of my forgetting my own environment, taking about 1 month and a half to be identified.
Despite the fact that I had already stabilized the data by the time of the GW, I still couldn't find the time to thoroughly investigate the multiple factors that caused the CTD. It was a bit frustrating.
Why did you not analyze the log files with the.NET Script Framework? (It will take a few minutes to understand.) Some errors are related to DLL series and hash table, so they cannot be ignored.
The timing of the main CTD is important.
All Paperwork and Net Script Framework, Logs should be saved in the type of.dll plug-ins' logs without leaving footprints.
If an NPC is killed during the accumulation of Essentials, the console will trigger a kill. This can be improved by disabling the Essentials. ※Is there a possibility of getting wet clothes?
* When the camera work for the kills of NPCs is off, it can significantly improve the gameplay by setting the kills off in the.ini file: Is there a conflict between the settings of DAR and Nemesis? However, the maximum number of DAR animations is limited to 10,000.
* (Basic Outdoor) Field Movement + Partial Magic (Example: Ice Armor) Activation, NPC Death: Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID Usage NPC Apply Setting (MCM's Right Top) All Off, All Attempts Improved.
Is there a misconfiguration of armor and body meshes sheaths in 2.0 that is causing this issue? The default SPID usage in 2.0 has a syntax error but the result is intended to be NPCs with the Perk applied.
At first, I focused on OnHit relationships and movement/combat MOD (DLL related) by soaking my clothes in water. However, this resulted in a feeling like this.
I have never heard of any similar problems in English, German, or French at the same level.
Those who are facing similar CTD problems in a Japanese environment may find it helpful to refer to this post as a reminder.

He was so scared that he started to shake uncontrollably.
Even though I am not mentally ready to retire, I feel like there is a limit to what I can do before I retire.
I am thinking about the importance of spiritual care visitation nursing - today's visitation nursing has ended.
Because I am suffering from dual diagnosis, I have been undergoing long-term counseling therapy. However, I am fortunate to have formed a strong bond with the therapist, who is a female. We have been able to build a very good relationship over time.
We have interesting conversations every week.
Although it is necessary to take care of medication and dressing (such as wound care), it is more important for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, which was discussed in today's visiting nursing.
Today, we had a discussion about gender differences and it was quite interesting. We laughed a lot.
So, what happened when she left her husband? Was it because of their differences in sexual desire? Or was it something else? Such a story would be interesting to hear.
Although I am wearing a skirt, I am still a man.
When the visiting nurse's aide from the psychiatric hospital came to the station, she said, "This place is for medical treatment, so I can't help you. But the visiting nurse is here, so you can ask her for help." I heard this story from a friend.
I am using the social welfare system to visit a small visiting nursing station, but I am grateful to the kind nurse who is treating me with respect. I hope to be treated kindly by the nurse, who is a good nurse.
You are so beautiful.
Both those who have received psychiatric care and those who are considering it should consider the implications of their decisions carefully.
Visiting a nursing home is very meaningful for those who have mental or physical illnesses.
If the doctor acknowledges it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good nursing home visiting station.

The Japanese patent for hydrogen technology and the Chinese five-year delay in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap (Central News Agency Japanese Language Edition).
The Japanese government announced the Hydrogen Economy Load Map in 2019.
By 2022, we aim to popularize 600,000 electric vehicles across the nation and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of water was set to 6,000 yen per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
Unfortunately, the target of 27% fuel cell vehicles in 2011 has not been achieved.
The share of hydrogen station infrastructure for the popularization of hydrogen energy is 38% (approximately 117 sites). The price of hydrogen per kilowatt is also the same as the time of the announcement and the load map is not significantly different from 8400won per ton.
It has been found that the load map of the water element economy is far below the target value.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (AJFEO) released a report titled "The Current Situation and Policy Directions of Hydrogen Economy" on November 12.
According to reports, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the lithium-ion battery for automobile is supplied by Toshiba (Japan), White Gold Catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), Membrane Film by DuPont (USA), Goa (USA), 3M (USA).
Six countries, including China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, have been actively filing for water technology patents, with an average annual growth rate of 14% since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of water production and fuel cells in Japan (2014-2020), Korea is the fifth in the world.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has been dominated by six countries, which is the "reality" that "lower-level" countries are competing in.
The order of patent application filing in Japan, China, the United States, and Europe is China, the United States, Japan, and Europe.
After China pulled away from the US in 2017, it has been expanding the gap ever since.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Japan (974 cases) and Korea (1033 cases) were ranked fourth and fifth respectively, but China's (4721 cases) 22% standard was the highest.
The Japanese government should designate "national strategic technology" as a category of investment and development expenses exempt from taxes.
I have had surgery to cut the tendon of my finger for about a month.

Is selling expensive items at a fixed price shop considered a crime?
The PS5 was a big hit at the store, selling over 7 million copies.
This is the law.
If the price of a branded product increases due to competition, for example, the value of the product may become more scarce than before.
For example, when a famous artist's work increases in value, it is considered to be the result of a legal transaction.
The price of Ps5 is high, but it is still a rare item with a low value. Its value has only recently increased from its original price.

The United States has deployed weapons and medicines to Ukraine as part of its training mission there, according to a report by CNN.
The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has reported that weapons, including firearms and ammunition, have arrived in Ukraine as part of a plan to provide assistance in the wake of the recognition of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.
The total amount of military aid to Ukraine is approximately $68 million. The last piece of equipment to be transported to Ukraine is a radar system to identify launch sites for rocket attacks.
According to the Cabinet Office of Japan, these weapons of mass destruction also included such items as "Jabarin" combat vehicles.
The purpose of Russia's military support for Ukraine is to strengthen Ukraine's military capabilities in the border area, including by increasing its defense capabilities.
The U.S. is monitoring the movements of the Russian military and reinforcing its warning, while negotiating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and taking countermeasures in case of a Russian attack on Ukraine.
The Baiden Great Empire has acknowledged the use of weapons of mass destruction by the Zalensky Great Empire of Ukraine by visiting the White House.
The military support from the U.S. to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of approximately 4 billion dollars.
Russia forced the annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, resulting in a huge increase in aid to Ukraine.
The U.S. military also participated in the training exerDescriptor: The U.S. military also participated in the training exercise.
The State of Florida sent troops to participate in the multinational joint training plan in Ucrainian support.
According to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of Japan, the U.S. Special Strategic Operation Forces are participating in the training and advising of the Ukrainian Special Forces in a major role.
The number of U.S. Special Forces deployed in Ukraine is still classified as a secret.
The summit meeting between the two heads of state of Denmark and Russia, which was held on the 7th of this month, was followed by a tense standoff between the two countries due to the situation in Ukraine.
If the United States is attacked, it will show a harsh austerity policy.

The LDP and Komeito have agreed to postpone the implementation of the consumption tax hike and to reduce the amount of money given to local governments. This is a major victory for the Abe government, as it has been able to avoid the unpopular tax hike and to reduce the burden on local governments. The LDP and Komeito have also agreed to reform the tax system, which will likely result in higher taxes for the middle and lower classes. This has been seen as a major betrayal by the opposition, with the DPJ and other opposition parties launching a fierce attack on the Abe government.
The first special issue of the Weekly Daiyamondo magazine on December 18th, 2018 is about "Family Conversations at the End and Beginning of the Year".
This is a technique of giving and receiving before engaging in a fight.
In the discussion of the integration of consumption tax and corporate tax, it was reported that the 2022 Tax Reform Plan would be postponed. However, it is likely that pre-consumption tax will be restricted in the near future.

We should consider the tax implications of transferring assets from a family-owned business to a city-based company before making a decision.
The 2021 Tax Reform Bill, which was announced by the ruling party last year, has caused a great deal of movement throughout the entire spectrum, from the wealthy to the middle class.
If we are to make a change in the rules of succession, it will involve a great increase in the tax burden. This is why the government is reluctant to talk about it.
The steel rule for reducing high-stepped progressive taxes is "to reduce taxable income."
The pre-tax contribution of the most powerful company in the world, which has a house in the three major metropolitan areas, has been widely utilized even though it is a small amount.
Discussion on the integration of the consumption tax and donations tax.
The 22nd Annual Tax Revision Basic Plan, which was announced on December 10th, revealed the direction of the government to make clear the status of the current taxation system and the inheritance tax system. It also stated that the government will not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family. This is a clear indication that the government is striving to integrate the taxation system.
The Chairman of the Tax Investigation Committee of the LDP, Mr. Kanai, and the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Kami, were speaking.
At the time of relocation, it is beneficial to lose the advantage and disadvantage equally, regardless of when the tax and burden are imposed.
"Underneath it all, there are various problems that come up due to the process of integration. However, if we simulate it, there is still a chance of receiving a speedy revision. The opportunity to make a final donation will be extended to three times."
Even if it is not possible to make a donation before death, it is hoped that the direction of cutting large taxes will be wrong.
How will the rules of succession and donation taxes change specifically?

The team that won the first three games of the NFL season felt a variety of emotions, according to the players (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News).
This match, John's throw was caught by Peter. Peter's pass was only caught three times.
This was the third week of the 1974 NFL season, and it was the first and only time the Bills have played the Giants in a regular season game.
In the 1974 season, the legendary O.J. Simpson, a Hall of Fame RB, broke the then-record 2000-yard mark for the first time in NFL history.
The Builders were defeated by the Simpson and the one-man RB Gym Blackstone's Lance in the end.
The reason for the extreme offensive of the PaytonRottz was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the border of Canada, which remains oriented towards the North Pacific Ocean.
Thus, this day was very cold, with the temperature almost at freezing point, and a strong wind of 18m/s blew, snowing before the match.
The buildings were only changed locally, without making any major changes to the selection of players.
For every 30 passes, the run should be 25 times.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
We couldn't find the sepet, but we tried our best.
There were 4 Red Zone invasions in the Offensive Series and the Defensive Point Machine was broken.
After the third quarter, they continued to run all the way to the red zone.
Although we only won 3 points in 3 matches, we didn't give up.
Defense before the last board in a match.
The buildings that were chasing the 4 points became the 3rd & 9th floor of the Penalty.
The distance to the goal is 18 yards.
The quarterback was surrounded by a sea of people on the 3rd&14, and he ran out of the pocket and to the right.
I threw the Endoson Token at the Pass but it failed.
At this point, the right outer wall was passed by Eas Wrstefon Digs, who was running towards the End Zone while wearing a Shaloraclus. However, it seemed that he could not be seen in Alen's eyes.
Arlen Harris ran left end around from the outside of the end zone and was tackled by WR Gabriel Dumont. The pass was incomplete and Arlen failed to make a first down. He was eventually brought down by DB Miles Bryant and failed to make a successful completion.
Brian had been working on the WR Coal Building's mansu-mancave for weeks, but when he saw the movement of the alien he let go of the beeze and reacted to the pass.
Allen threw two Endorsements to pass the Reshiber.
We couldn't decide whether to take a 4th down or not, but we didn't need to take a 3rd down to hunt for a TD.
It is possible to achieve a first down in two attempts of a play.
Since I was still at the 2-minute mark, I had to sprint to the finish line in order to utilize my own running ability.

"Sometimes it's time to let go of things, and sometimes it's time to replace them with something new. Here are three items to help you spruce up your kitchen for the long haul." (Harper's BAZAAR (Hāpāruz Bazā ))
Sponge
Even if you frequently replace it with something else, it is impossible to be as frequent as it was before. That's why it's called a sponge.
Even though kitchen sponges are often used to clean dishes, they can actually harbor bacteria and fungi. Recent studies have shown that bacteria and fungi can reproduce rapidly in kitchen sponges even when they are not used for cleaning.
A German researcher who participated in this study suggested that the person should rinse their mouth with water for one week and use a mouthwash once a day.
Manana board
The United States Department of Agriculture has begun to replace damaged and worn-out wooden pallets with new ones.
Whenever a wound or sore starts to heal, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria start to multiply.
If you are still a big man, then dilute 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water with an odorless liquid bleach to make a tablespoon of the solution and frequently disinfect your table spoon. Do not forget.
Immerse a wooden board in the liquid for several minutes.
Using a clean, soft paper towel, gently wring out the water from the beautiful, clear paper towel.
Dishware that has been chipped or cracked.
Even though it may be painful to divide your favorite magical cup, the uneven surface will become a warm and cozy home for bacteria and fungi.
It is also possible that the cause of the coughing or drinking problem is due to the missing part of the throat.

Community markets and trading are different things.
Should we use the Steam Early Access system at the Community Market?
This function can be used to commit fraud without being caught. Those who are likely to be caught are those who attempt to use it for other people's red and for money exchange.

FlashBIOS will never end with your help.
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X in September and replaced it with a B550 and a Tomahawk.

Even if the BIOS has been damaged, FlashBIOS can be used to rewrite it without any problems.
According to the MSI blog, it takes about 5 minutes to finish the game, but you can still continue playing even after an hour.

Why do you feel ashamed of having brand products?
If it's something you can't put down, like a book or a pair of shoes, you can't put it down even if it's expensive. You might as well go for something with a good design, like a Louis Vuitton Monogram.
Why is that?
It's nice to think that I'm growing into a mature adult.
I think Japan is nice.
In Japan, it is.
There is no connection between the Gajin Wind and the Kagura.
It's better to talk early, "Why are you just standing there/staring?"
Why can't I just be treated as a foreigner without any relation? I was so angry when I said that.
I'm so frustrated with the low probability of success. I can't stop thinking about it even in my dreams.
Although I had been living abroad, I had never felt so out of place than when I came back to Japan. I was surprised to find that even the locals had a hard time understanding me. It seemed like there was a language barrier between us.
If you appear to be a Westerner, there is no need to be concerned about having an evil spirit. Just be yourself and you will be fine.
If my friends were from Europe or America, I would call them by their last names. But since they are Japanese, I call them by their first names instead.
If you're friends with someone from Japan, they'll be really nice to you.
Even though it is ordinary and plain, it is still important to handle it with care, as it may cause unexpected problems in the future. For example, if you talk about it now, it may be helpful.
Even if you speak Japanese, you won't understand the rules of the game.
When I go back to my hometown, my white friend always serves me a higher glass of alcohol at a drinking party.
I think Japanese people have a lot of interesting customs and habits. For example, when they make a mistake, instead of getting angry, they will just laugh it off and shrug it off. They are also very polite and considerate, even with strangers. They are also very patient and understanding, even with younger people. I think these are all great habits to have.
Japanese people are known for their unique and delicate mannerisms, regardless of their personality. (Including myself.) They tend to be quite observant of their surroundings.

Since I have only a limited ability to understand English, I will judge the text that has been translated only by its content.
The translated text may give a slightly awkward feeling, but it is still understandable and playable at the same level as before (I thought it would be good to try).
It is often difficult to find accurate translations for games made outside of Japan. However, small companies that specialize in localizing games tend to do a good job with their translations.
Can people who don't speak Japanese well understand the subtle differences between the two languages?
I don't know what level you're trying to reach, but if Japanese people are able to feel comfortable even at a level that foreigners find interesting, then it's worth exploring.

There are various reasons why people want to have a place of their own to relax. Some people want a place to call their own, while others want a place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Some people may want a place to pursue their hobbies, while others may want a place to spend quality time with their family. Everyone has their own reasons for wanting a place to call their own.

Recently, the manga "The Edge of Evil" has been causing a stir among the youth. According to reports, it is said to be "too extreme" in its content of self-discovery and growth.
It is commonly believed that the Battle Royale-inspired storylines are not popular with readers.
It took two years of hard training to become as powerful as the same level of the manga "One Piece". Even though he only drew a single stroke, he was able to fly joyfully.
There are many attractive things about the Earth, such as its diversity of cultures, languages, landscapes, and cuisines. However, there is one thing that is not so attractive: the tendency for people to stay in the same place and not explore or experience other cultures.
After helping Chōjiro, the main character of "Kinmokusei no Shiro", to complete his training, Tōka Rōji was asked to give up his own life in order to obtain the power of murder and theft. He was told, "To seize the power of murder and theft for others!!"

Before entering the mountain to perform the ritual of purification, one must make sure to check for hidden traps, such as pitfalls, hidden rocks, and snares.
Despite the sharp smell of the dung beetle's excrement, which was handled by the people's hands, it became "Prince's Correction" by avoiding it.
Even though it was sudden, he was able to avoid it completely by raising his physical strength suddenly! However, it was his true nature to be able to exorcise demons with exorcisms.
Suddenly, people who were ordinary before gained tremendous strength and skill without noticing. They woke up and realized that they had been polishing their potential with their own effort.
Those who have put in effort will be rewarded, but those who have not put in effort will not be rewarded. This is the principle of "effort for effort exchange", which is based on the superhuman strength of the devil and not on the human's praise. This rule is difficult to follow in the work.

24-Carriage Collision in Aichi, Train Operator Uninjured (ANN Television) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the 24-seater bus that caused a crash in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, was apprehended and sent for investigation. The driver of the bus, who was injured in the crash, is believed to have been unaware of the cause.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Shimokawa City, Hokkaido, and 12 people were injured.
The police first caused a traffic accident and arrested a 71-year-old man for suspected drunk driving. On the 12th, they sent the suspect, 54-year-old Noguchi Yoshikazu, for further investigation.
The suspect in the Yasuhiro Yasuda case kept walking even after his car ran out of brakes, and was found to have lost consciousness shortly after the fire department arrived.
Unfortunately, it has been reported that the suspect in the Nishimura case is not suffering from any illness, but rather due to some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching the suspect's home and investigating the current situation in detail.

The fourth chapter of the manga "Oginomama X" was reviewed! (Weekly Pocket News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics began in the third volume and has now concluded in the fourth volume!
The manga starts off with a bang and immediately throws you into the action. It's a completely new and refreshing take on the shounen genre!
●"Kin-Kin Man" Vol. 4 Review by Oginamax (Star 5) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling Begins Even Before the Match Starts!
This four-volume series was drawn with great care and attention to detail, but it would be a shame if it ended here. Therefore, it was decided to draw a volume depicting the ring match as well.
We started from the basics and gradually improved our skills in teamwork, takedowns, and submissions, as well as learning various techniques. Despite not being able to make it to the competition, we will never give up.
As the tension of the story slowly builds up, the reader can feel the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming battle. This feeling of suspense is heightened as the story progresses, making it more realistic and immersive.
Meanwhile, the third-place match between Teriyaki Man and Ramen Man was decided in the decisive match before the grand final.
While I was looking for a luxurious snack before the match, a guy who was selling ramen suddenly shouted to me, "From now on, I'll be the one who wins the match!"
Trying to make a pop sound with a bop.
Unfortunately, the silent but powerful Tamamori stopped the terrifying man with his sword, and the scene changed suddenly and peacefully.
This is the last chance to fight against the powerful Kin-Kin Man, and there is no opportunity to do so within this convention.
Despite the fact that it is so difficult to find a suitable partner, I still keep on trying.
If you can see such a future, you won't be able to resist imagining it!
It's amazing how much has changed since that time when we used to gather around the karuta table. Now I'm feeling a bit of pain as a manga artist!
Although the fight between those two was short, it still left a mark. The scene after the match was that of a lonely ramen man crying.
"You must never underestimate the power of the gods' karma!"
That is a lifel.
This is already a powerful metaphor for the reader, but it's still not enough for the protagonist, so he keeps pushing himself harder and harder until he finally succeeds. That's why I feel like I'm slowly but surely making progress.
Even though the teacher scolded him for talking about ramen, he kept talking about it.
Readers will ask, "Can a skinny man really defeat a powerful giant with strength alone?"
What are you doing? 」
It seems like the writer is trying to imagine what will happen in the future development of the story even though they can't see it yet. It's like they're creating a new path for themselves by tying their own legs together.
This is a great thing to do.
I think this is the most important point of the whole book.

When I was reading a book, my friend came and started talking to me. At first, I was a bit annoyed, but then I realized that he was trying to help me.

This morning's misfortune has…
We have lost the power supply for our NAS-use PC. 😢😢😢😢
That happened.
Open the window for the morning change of air.
This is the time for PC shutdown.
2.) After a while, the sound of a Pink Rotor from the PC became irritating. So I shut it down by pressing the power button.
At this point, it is considered that the movement of the fan has become worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
I tried it again even though it didn't work the first time.
3.) No action.
When you press the power button, the power lamp will turn on for just one moment, then it will turn off immediately.
After that, there was nothing to say.
Try it again by unplugging the power plug just for a moment.
4.) Unplug the Motherboard and ATX20 pin connector, then try to power on the computer.
There have been rumors that PSU fans are responsible for the loud noise that can be heard from the past.
We will try to find an ATX power supply after the fact.

The popularity of emoji has been increasing significantly in Japan. According to Gizmodo Japan, the country's emoji ranking has been released.
The character I use the most is a crying emoji.
I believe that picture characters are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there have been many applications and tools that enable users to create stamps instead of using emoticons or emojis.
Spicy, simple, no reply needed, polite element.
In the modern communication, the soft atmosphere is essential!
Everyone is using cute emoticons these days.
[Viewing the Entire Ranking of Picture Characters] 2021, The Most Used Picture Character Ranking in the World!
Positive and bright emoticons are ranking in widely.
According to the Unicode Standard, 92% of the world's net population is using emoticons.
The 1st place is taken by the character set with a 5% usage rate!
Even though the laughing emoticons with the first, third, and fifth places are not very popular, they are still used occasionally.
When it's interesting time, happy time is definitely coming!
Even if it's not the right time, you can still use it selfishly in your own way. But since there are fewer people like that, it's alright, right?
People who have never used a top 10 anime character once are rare.

In Japan, paper money can be exchanged for coins, but coins cannot be exchanged for paper money.
Since the commemorative coins contain gold, they are valuable and can be exchanged for cash.
